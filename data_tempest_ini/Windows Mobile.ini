Description=3D Lawn Darts takes the classic game of lawn darts and brings it to mobile devices.  Lawn darts is a game played outside where you lob big metal darts at a circle on the ground.  The game was banned in the United States and Canada because of all the injuries.<br><br>The unique thing with 3D Lawn Darts (besides having a full 3D game on a mobile device) is that it uses real motion for throwing the darts.  The way this works is that the mobile device must have a camera that the game can use.  Then during the game, it vibrates to let you know to toss the dart.  Once the person feels the vibration, he/she then makes a throwing motion while a picture is taken.  The game then analyzes the pictures blur to decide where the dart goes.  Once the motion is made he/she can view the screen and follow the dart in the 3D world through the air till it hits the target.<br><br>Besides the motion other features of the game are choice of 3D world (4 choices), choice of player to throw the dart (4 choices again) and different types of darts to throw.  Dart choices include flaming darts, nuclear darts, magnetic darts, and more.

Description=6 Colors is a freeware version of the long-forgotten  7 Colours by Infogrames<br><br>Two opponents (one of them can be an AI) start from opposite corners of the gameboard, which is covered by randomly colored tiles. The aim is to expand across the board annexing tiles to your domain. The one who gets more than 50% of the gameboard area wins.<br><br>Each move involves selecting one of the six colors, which will annex any tiles of that colour which are adjacent to one of your tiles, and temporarily turn your whole domain to that color. It is not possible to select the color your opponent has just played, to prevent attempting to annex his tiles - however this color will always be available in your next move.<br><br>The game allows square, hexagonal, and random-shape tiles.  To ensure that the game is fair, one can flip the gameboard and play again from another side.

Description=Atomica Deluxe is a tile-matching puzzle game where players need to form molecules by moving atoms around the grid. The most straightforward molecule is a square form of four atoms of the same colour, but more complex patterns using different colours are also possible. The game can be played turn-based, with new atoms appearing after every move, or real-time where the game progresses regardless of the player's actions. For each of these modes, there is also an expert version with many more colours.<br><br>To progress through the levels, players need to form a certain amount of molecules before empty space on the grid is taken up entirely. For each group, a molecule meter near the top of the screen is filled, showing the level progress. Atoms are moved around using the mouse and can be placed anywhere on the grid, as long as there is a direct route possible without other atoms blocking the path. Points are awarded for each molecule formed, causing it to disappear from the grid. New atoms that appear on the grid are hinted at with a faded, coloured symbol, which can be incorporated in the strategy.<br><br>By forming combos, a geiger meter is filled. Multiple combos trigger a super combo and the different combos charge up an atomic bomb that can be used to blow up random atoms on the grid. When enough molecules are formed, the player is offered to form a more complex, bonus molecule using more advanced shapes and different colours. Upon completing it, a bonus atom is provided on the grid. It can be moved around to form a group (opening the option to get a more powerful bonus atom) or it can be double clicked to trigger it. For instance, the level 1 fire bonus atom will clear nine squares on the grid, but an advanced one will destroy more. There are also time-limited biohazard atoms that need to be disposed off quickly before they start replicating.<br><br>The game includes a high score list and saves the level progress.

Row moving is possible due to the fact that the rows (both horizontal and vertical) are "round", meaning that moving the outer left Chuzzle one tile to the left will result in appearing of it at the outer right position.<br><br>The four different game modes are: Classic, Speed, Zen and Mind Bender.<br><br>Classic works like explained above, but you will also face mega Chuzzles (2x2 tiles big) which can't move out of the screen and locks, which will lock the two rows where it is located. Locks can be destroyed by making a match (mega Chuzzles by the way too). The game mode is level based. Just score as much points as needed for the level and you proceed with the next one. If you run out of possible matches, you can scramble the screen (basically this equals the lost of a life).<br><br>Speed is like Classic, but you play against the clock. With each match, the counter is set a bit back, but as soon as the counter reaches the top, one Chuzzle will be locked. This goes until no moves are possible. Once you completed the level, the locks are reset.<br><br>Zen is a relaxing mode. No locks and no clock.<br><br>In Mind Bender, you job is to recreate a certain given pattern with your 36 Chuzzles. No clock and no special level order required to play.<br><br>For the first three game modes, if you don't know any further, you can buy a hint (reduction of the score).<br><br>The major feature of the game are the trophies. In the Trophy Room, you see 22 placeholders for trophies, which will be awarded as soon as you met the requirements. Those are for example for seven-step cascades (you make one match, which will trigger six additional matches), beating 10 levels of Classic, making a six tiles long match, or playing a game without using a hint and much much more.

Take up the role of a reporter, and figure out whodunnit before your editor, Braunmann, sends the story to presses in Clue.<br><br>Clue is a game inspired by the board game of the same name.  Rather than being identical to the original game, the goal in this version of the game is to work out where the crime took place, who committed the crime, and what was used by interrogating those at the crime scene and examining suspicious places in each room.  You'll be given useful information which will reveal the locations of most (if not all) characters and weapons, as well as find out the cause of Black's demise.<br><br>You'll be racing against the clock with each case - you've got to make your deadline.

Description=Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks.  They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!<br><br>Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him.  Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid.  Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him.  Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map.  In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited.  Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.<br><br>Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision.  Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death.  (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)<br><br>Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon.  Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.

Description=Hexic is a puzzle game by Tetris mastermind Alexey Pazhitnov. Originally released as a free online game included with MSN Messenger 6.0, a commercial, enhanced, downloadable version, Hexic Deluxe, was released soon after. The Xbox 360 version, Hexic HD, comes preinstalled with all Xbox 360 premium units. It improves upon the original game with high-definition television support, achievements and score tracking through the leaderboards.<br><br>The game shows a board filled with red, blue, light green, dark green, yellow, pink, and purple hexagons. The object is to select three adjacent pieces and choose the rotation direction, causing the pieces to rotate until a match of three same-coloured pieces is created (a cluster) or until they return to their original position. When a cluster is created, the pieces disappear and new ones are added from the top.<br><br>Advanced strategies are required to handle bombs. These count down with every move you make. To clear them from the board, you have to form a cluster with it. When the bomb detonates, the game is over. You gain additional points by including stars, creating chain combos or by forming a cluster with a special pattern. When you manage to surround a single piece with six same-colour pieces, a flower star appears. Flowers stars rotate all pieces around it. If you manage to surround one piece with six flower stars, a black pearl is performed. To win the game in the Marathon mode, you have to create a black pearl combo. There are different final combos possible and the most impressive one requires you to create a flower of black pearls with a black pearl inside.<br><br>The main game modes for Hexic Deluxe and Hexic HD are:<br><br>1. Marathon: unlimited gameplay without time pressure until a black pearl combo is formed or a bomb detonates.<br><br>2. Timed: get as many points as you can before time runs out. Forming clusters provides a time bonus and star flowers reset or expand the time.<br><br>3. Survival: 50 levels where you need to score as many points as possible. Cleared pieces are not replaced by new ones and the remaining ones are locked into the board for the next round. These locked pieces can no longer be moved, but you can remove them by creating clusters with star pieces. The game ends when the entire board is filled with locked pieces.

Description=An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.<br><br>id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.<br><br>In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.<br><br>Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.<br><br>The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.<br><br>Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

Description=Raging Thunder is a racing game for mobile devices. As an arcade racer at heart, the game allows the player to try out four different cars with different abilities when it comes to speed, acceleration and grip. It's played from a third person perspective and is fully rendered in 3D with the developer's own Fuse engine. Two control methods are available. The player can either use the touch screen by dragging his finger right or left or the gyro sensor by tilting the phone. Acceleration and braking is done by dragging the finger up and down on the screen. When using the touch screen to steer it is possible to enable auto acceleration. The cars also has boosting and tackling functionality. To boost the player needs to pick up lighting bolt collectibles that are scattered around the tracks and this gives some extra power briefly. In addition to the lighting bolts there is also laughing skulls which the player has to avoid since they will drain the player's boost. When no boost is left the car slows to a crawl for a few seconds.  Tackling can be done whenever the player is close to a competitor who is then sent spinning. <br><br>The game features three game modes: arcade, time attack and championship. In the arcade mode the player gets to race through all the levels and has to reach checkpoints before the time expires. In the time attack mode the player gets to compete for the fastest time on any track that is unlocked. In the championship mode the player gets paid for the races and is able to upgrade his car or buy a new one. In the championship mode the player also unlocks the levels that become available in time attack and multiplayer. <br><br>Multiplayer is available over both a local wireless network and over the Internet. It's cross-platform for meaning that players with different types of handsets can compete against each other.

It is also possible not to move and fire the two broadside cannons to the left and the right of the ship instead, with a maximum reach of three squares.<br><br>Since the player's galleon is always outnumbered, the pirates can be tricked to move inside the line of fire.

As a last resort the player's ship can also move into a whirlpool, which teleports the ship to a random location on the map. Players get points for each ship taken down and later levels introduce new opponents such as sea monsters. The player start with three lives.

Description=Westward is a real-time strategy game similar to the Settlers series and the more recent Virtual Villagers. The player must build and maintain a wild west town, and perform certain tasks to progress. Some of these include finding lost treasures, gun-fighting desperadoes and blowing up obstacles with dynamite.<br><br>All the actions are performed by clicking and holding the mouse button over a character or a group of characters, and dragging a line of dots to a place or object in the terrain.  When the end of the line is over a collectable object, the cursor changes to a purse. When it is over a building with housing facilities or a job opportunity, it changes to either a house icon or an icon of shaking hands. Releasing the button makes the character follow the line path to the objective and perform the action.<br><br>Certain characters, like the Sheriff and gunslingers, have to be hired at their respective buildings, but most settlers arrive at the city spontaneously as soon as the city population limit increases.<br><br>Each citizen and building consume a fixed amount of resources like food, wood and gold. Buildings also create resources, and need employees to function. Some of the characters' status is indicated by icons floating over their heads. A food icon, for example, shows that the character is hungry.<br><br>The city is afflicted by random disasters. Cyclones damage the buildings, droughts and famine diminish productivity, and an insufficient number of outhouses can produce an outbreak of plague.<br><br>Combat follows the same interface of the other actions. The dotted line is dragged from a combat character or a group of them, and the cursor changes to a firing pistol when it's over an enemy.<br><br>There are side-missions within each level. Usually a character comes bringing news or a request for help. Clicking "okay" on the dialog box loads a separate level. Once it is completed, the game returns to the main city.
