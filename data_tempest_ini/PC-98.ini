Description=2 Shot Diary is a collection of twelve short episodes of sexual nature, each told by a different young woman, presented as entries in their diaries. There is no connection between the stories. Each heroine has a different profession and social status (high school student, nurse, model, etc.), where each episode usually centers around a particular sexual theme (voyeurism, lesbian sex, rape, etc.). The game is almost entirely pornographic, with nearly each screen being a depiction of a sexual activity.<br><br>The game may be considered a visual novel, because no skill whatsoever is required to play the game and most of it is composed of text accompanied by pictures rather than interaction. Instead of making decisions, characteristically for most visual novels, the player chooses words from a menu to insert into the text. If the choice makes no sense, it simply disappears and the player chooses another one.

Each of them has a name and a short biography, including likes and dislikes, sexual experience, etc. After choosing a girl, the game has to match her portrait by clicking on one of the four cards hiding pictures of different girls. Then the player goes through the girl's bio, asking a limited amount of questions. Then it is time to choose one of the many available sexual positions, trying to choose the one the girl would be most comfortable with, according to her data known to the player.

Only one man can save them - Mr. M's friend, the famous Space Gigolo, Red Cobra, the one who "lives and dies for love and justice"!

But alas, not all is simple: the sexy, but deadly intergalactic warrior Mangoose and her minions will do everything possible to stop Red Cobra! Be vigilant, hero!<br><br>Usually just called Red Cobra, this game is yet another Illusion-made genre experiment. This time, we are talking about space shooter with sex.

The best golfers from all over the world came to compete, but nobody from Japan... so naturally, the player has to correct that!<br><br>Referring to itself as a &quot;3D simulation golf game&quot;, Alaskan Malamute G.C. features pseudo-3D terrain with rotatable camera. The player is able to adjust his golfer's position, strength, direction, and style of the shot. It is possible to create own players with different statistics.

Description=The plot of this game is very simple: there is a big Expo in Japan, and the protagonist - working as a journalist for a company called "Oh!" (suspiciously similar to the company that designed this game) - must enter each pavilion and take pictures of the female models there. The trick is that the company is interested in erotic pictures of semi- or completely nude models, so the hero must use all his charm in order to convince the models to do so...<br><br>Alice-tachi no Gogo can be considered an adventure game with RPG angle. The main challenge of the game is to explore the huge, complex Expo area, finding people and items needed to gain access to new locations. However, there is also an RPG system in the game, even though many typical RPG elements (combat, equipment, etc.) are absent. The hero has a health bar, which is depleted whenever he tries to convince a girl to undress. In a sense, encounters with girls in the pavilions are equivalent to battles in other RPGs: some girls are too "strong", and the hero has to level up before he can "fight" them. Levels are gained by successfully undressing girls, which corresponds to the cornerstone of RPG gameplay: become stronger through experience.

The two volumes were released as separate game packages, but they can be considered two parts of the same game.<br><br>The second volume has exactly the same story as the first: as a journalist working for a company named "Oh!", the player has to explore a huge Expo area and take pictures of as many pretty girls as possible, preferably undressed. <br><br>The gameplay is identical to the first volume. The protagonist procures items or information to access new areas of the Expo, and deals with the girls in the pavilions in a RPG-like fashion, gaining "good feeling" (experience points) when trying to convince a girl to undress, at the same time losing "spirit" (hit points). Selling photos of the girls brings money, which in its turn is spent on healing and other items.<br><br>What prevents this second volume from being exactly the same game as the first is a completely different layout of the Expo, somewhat increased difficulty level, and - naturally - an all-new cast of pretty girls waiting to be undressed.

Description=The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.<br><br>The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.<br><br>By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

The captain ordered to fire the strongest weapons, but nothing could help: the aliens invaded the ship...<br><br>...and in a unique twist, the player has to control an alien. No information is given about this playable character, that looks like a red crab. It starts at level 1, at the point where it invaded the ship. The game plays like a first-person dungeon crawler (this time the word "crawler" taken quite literally!). The alien moved through the pseudo-3D corridors of the ship. Crew members, robots and machines appear randomly and try to stop it. The battles are turn-based. The alien has two primary kinds of attacks at its disposal: physical attack (with its claw), and electricity attack. Defeating enemies brings experience points, leveling up the creature.

Description=King Ogreth of the Basam Empire has invaded your country and either captured or turned into rocks and trees all your soldiers. You, king Suren, are left completely alone. In a desperate attempt, you decide to walk to king Ogreth's castle and to defeat him. You hope you'll be able to find some way to bring your soldiers back to you...<br><br>In this strategy game, your goal sounds simple  just walk a distance of 600 meters and defeat king Ogreth. But to do that is not simple at all. Bumping into trees and rocks, king Suren can bring his soldiers to life. Once there are some knights in his small army, he will also be able to free imprisoned soldiers. King Ogreth's units will constantly attack you on the way. The results of the battles are calculated automatically, according to the strength of your units. So before you engage in a battle, you have to be sure you have the upper hand (you have gathered enough soldiers, they have trained in easier battles, etc.). If king Suren dies in a battle, the game is over - you'll have to start from the beginning no matter how near you were to your goal.

Description=The third in the  Can Can Bunny series, Can Can Bunny Spirits deals with a nameless hero (the player has to give him a name) who is - in accordance with Can Can Bunny tradition - a lonely guy who can't get a girlfriend. One night he sits at home and stares at the moon. Suddenly, the magic fairy Ariko appears in front of him and gives him... no, this time not the Magic Book, but a Magic Crescent! With the help of this crescent, the hero can turn into totally different young men - which will naturally increase his chances in impressing girls and ultimately having sex with them.<br><br>Can Can Bunny Spirits is much less of an adventure and more of a strategy game than its predecessors. Success depends even more on the preparations before the actual decisive stage. There is also extensive customization in this game. In the beginning, the hero chooses what he wants to be like, which includes age, height, blood type, and other parameters. Then Ariko introduces several girls to him, of which he has to choose one. Afterwards, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving the right answers, combining knowledge of the girl's preferences and of the character's statistics. Each girl has a "love meter that can be raised or lowered depending on the player's strategies, and once it is full, the hero can have his way with the girl.

He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!<br><br>Compared to the first game, Can Can Bunny Superior plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like "Look", "Move", etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into tree separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each (the scenarios begin in a shopping mall, aboard a plane, and in an amusement park), but the goal is always the same: talk to the girl in such a way that she will become yours.

However, one day a pretty young lady (whom the player also has to name) storms into his house, saying she has a message from the Emperor himself. A princess is missing, so our two heroes have to find her. And the hero also has to face some of his old foes...<br><br>Continental is a traditional Japanese RPG with a small party of heroes, top-down navigation, random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective, and no distinguishing characteristics but one: erotic scenes. There aren't as many here as in, for example,  Lightning Warrior Raidy games, and they mostly occur in city brothels or after boss battles. The enemies, however, do look like pretty (although demonic) girls. Instead of undressing, though (as they do in Raidy games), they just shrink in size upon defeat.

Description=For a long time, five magical crystal orbs have been protecting our universe. One of them was hidden on the Earth. But there was a young woman who desired too much power, and she came to the Earth in order to harvest the power of its crystal for her selfish purposes. The only ones who can stop her are Takanoshin, the son of a samurai warrior, and the young girl Noichigo, who teaches little children. Together, they embark on a long and perilous journey through the land of Japan...<br><br>The game's setting is modern-day Japan with many anachronistic medieval-like elements. Despite its RPG-like plot and unusual perspective (effectively third-person, since the player-controlled characters are visible on the screen at all times), Crystal Chaser is an adventure game. The player mostly controls Takanoshin and Noichigo (often together as a "party"), but sometimes switches to other characters. The game has no real puzzles, and the entire interaction (including moving) is done via selecting commands in a menu; however, compared to most other Japanese adventures, the game contains more interaction, including inventory item usage.

Brutal assassins attack the town, but Angelo swiftly deals with them. The head priestess of the town thanks him and explains that peace can be restored only if the two goddesses who protect the land will return. It appears that the goddesses were captured, so our hero decides to find them and bring them back.<br><br>Crystal Dream is a solo turn-based RPG with a very basic combat system. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. Navigation is performed by pressing directional arrow keys, which takes the player character from one still screen to another. At every screen, it is possible to "camp" (which opens inventory and equipment menu), as well as look around and talk to people - or attack if an enemy appears. There is also the possibility to directly have sex at any moment; naturally, the game will refuse to do that if a female character is not present (or not willing). Some women require certain items to be given to them. If all goes well, the player is rewarded with a still erotic picture of the girl.

But the Duke should be careful: who knows what challenges await for him among the demi-humans, outside of the safe walls of the capital city Berlin?..<br><br>Crystal Quest is a puzzle game with adventure elements - the Duke's top-down movement and the ability to access different locations to tackle different puzzles.

He chants the magic spell - and immediately a cute female elf appears. She says she can create any girl the hero wants. But once the girl is created, he has to figure out how to win her good graces...<br><br>Custom Mate can be called a "seduction simulator". Lacking the adventure elements of  Cocktail's most famous series,  Can Can Bunny, Custom Mate offers much deeper simulation gameplay instead. In the beginning of the game, the player effectively "creates" the girl he will need to seduce; it is possible to choose age, height, breast size, hair style, and personality. Mixing all these parameters results in different girls who require different approach. For example, an older, experienced and direct woman might appreciate physical stimulation (kissing etc.), while a young shy girl needs to talk more before the hero can afford any straight-forward actions. <br><br>The gameplay is menu-driven - the player can choose to talk, to ask, to look, to touch, to kiss, and to take off the girl's clothes. Choosing one of these actions usually leads to a sub-menu, which varies depending on the girl and the current situation. For example, the "talk" menu usually brings a large sub-menu of more precise actions ("praise", "order", "beg", etc.), each of which opens new sub-menus. Similarly, physical interaction can also become quite detailed: the "kiss" command opens a sub-menu ("lick", "bite", etc.). Physical interaction is made more precise by implementing a point-and-click interface; in many cases, choosing the exact body part to interact with can be a matter of "life and death", since it is possible to make a girl very angry, which might lead to a Game Over.

Agreeing to participate in sexual activities with these inhabitants decreases the girls' HP, but grants them experience points that raises their "perversity level", and with it increases other parameters, that will allow the girls to participate in more dangerous sexual exercises without dying.

Description=Somewhere lies a beautiful island, which for centuries has been the battle ground for the titanic war between the forces of Light and Darkness. No side was able to control the island for a long time; after a while, the war raged anew, and the island fell under the control of the other side.<br><br>Forty years ago, the Light, represented by human being, prevailed in the latest battle. The island was occupied by humans. One day, a strange-looking man appeared on it. He had no memory of his own past, except his name, Dulldeek, and the hatred to humans. Without knowing what this hatred was caused by, Dulldeek feels the rage of the Dark inside him. He decides to infiltrate the castle of Veevik, the humans' fortress, to satisfy his burning anger...<br><br>D'ark is a very simple solo first-person dungeon crawler. As Dulldeek, the player navigates maze-like pseudo-3D dungeons (with auto-mapping), encountering randomly appearing enemies and fighting them in turn-based combat to gain experience points and level up. The magic system is very basic, the sole choice being &quot;attack spell&quot; or &quot;healing spell&quot;,  both of which consume magic points. A somewhat unusual feature is the option to turn off random encounters completely at any time.

The anti-hero of the previous game, the mysterious Dulldeek, has released the four Dragon Knights in order to help the Darkness to defeat the Light in the upcoming battle. After the light warrior Felnous was defeated by Dulldeek, it looked like the Light has lost...<br><br>D'ark Gaiden allows the player to play through two scenarios, one continuing the adventures of Dulldeek and the Dragon Knights (starting as the Black Dragon Knight Zarsch, one of Dulldeek's companions), the other casting Felnous as a protagonist, recovering after the battle with Dulldeek and swearing to exact revenge.<br><br>The gameplay is essentially the same as in the previous game: basic solo dungeon crawl through pseudo-3D mazes, turn-based combat against random enemies. It is now possible to cast defensive support magic. The animations in combat are improved, and there are more different textures in the dungeons. As in the first game, there is the possibility to turn random encounters off; in this game, there is an additional "MAX" option, which cranks the encounter rate up.

But as a result, demons invaded the Earth, led by Satan himself. The proud humans of the city Sodom started building the Tower of Babel (sic), trying to reach the skies. God sent a high-ranked seraph named Alucard to reason with humans. However, archangel Michael thought differently, figuring that the humans deserved no forgiveness. Meanwhile, the Satan has his own plans...<br><br>Dark Seraphim is an action RPG. The player navigates Alucard through top-down locations. When enemies attack, the player is taken to a separate battle screen. As Alucard, it is possible to move freely and to attack enemies simply by bumping into them. Running towards the edge of the screen would allow the hero to escape. During battles Alucard is often surrounded by a large amount of enemies; but friendly characters can join him and fight on his side.

Possessed by the desire to conquer and to destroy, he orders his armies to set cities on fire, massacring the citizens. But one nameless hero, the protagonist of this game, has to stand up against the evil. Leaving Soron, his home village, the hero embarks on a journey to find companions and to face together the forces of darkness.<br><br>Despite being a Japanese game, Death Bringer is more similar to Western RPGs of the time than to their Japanese counterparts, even though it has anime-style character graphics. It is less event-oriented than Japanese games and focuses on exploration. The gameplay is somewhat similar to  Pandora's  RPG of the same name, even though the two games are unrelated. Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in  Bard's Tale games. Enemy encounters, however, are handled more similarly to those of  Ultima: the enemies appear on the exploration screen, and the battle initiates only if the player character approaches the enemy. The battles take place on a top-down field; the heroes and the enemies move around, but the player can't navigate the characters manually: it is only possible to issue commands such as &quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Use Magic&quot;, etc. The game has a day/night cycle. Party members (up to three, excluding the hero) have to be sought out in various cities, rather then joining the hero for plot-related reasons.

At the same time Tina, a young girl, is washed ashore in the island with no recolection of what has happened to her or who she is, and meanwhile the technical manager at Desire Makoto Izumi seems to think something weird is going on with the researchs being conducted. You'll play through 4 chapters which make up the same storyline, but viewed by different characters. In each chapter you'll see the events and situations from different angles and uncover layers and layers of the main plotline which twists and bends in standard C's Ware fashion (and in the way you'll hook up with all of Desire's female population!).<br><br>The game is played via a standard text interface were you select your actions and interact with other characters and places. Obviously, being a hentai game, there are many depictions of hardcore sexual situations so don't say you weren't warned.

Description=Ash is a young mercenary who emerges victorious in every battle. But he doesn't know why luck is always with him; he also doesn't know why he is sometimes haunted by ghosts who call him &quot;Death God Ash&quot;, and why mysterious butterflies appear in front of him and guide him to his next destination. The latest &quot;butterfly assignment&quot; was to go to the kingdom of Zamhan and to follow the mayor's order. Will Ash finally find out the true answers to his mysterious destiny?<br><br>Dinosaur combines characteristic features of both Western and Japanese RPGs. Typically for the latter genre, the player is unable to create a party of adventurers; characters with their own backgrounds join Ash as dictated by the plot. However, the fully 3D first-person navigation is reminiscent of Western RPGs such as the  Wizardry series. The enemies appear randomly and are fought in turn-based combat. The party can rest at any time, restoring health and technique points. There is no auto-map feature; only the compass aids the player when navigating the maze-like dungeons of the game.

Naturally, this mundane task is just the beginning of great adventures that await these young people...<br><br>Iraisha wa Monster? is the first part of the episodic  Disc Saga, which covers the first part of the heroes' adventure (up to approximately level 10 in character growth). It is a traditional Japanese RPG, particularly influenced by early  Final Fantasy games - a full party of four characters with sharply defined classes (fighter, magic user, etc.) right at the beginning of the game, top-down battles with "heroes to the right, enemies to the left" position, etc. Unlike most Japanese RPGs of the time, there are no random encounters: the enemies are visibly roaming the world, and sometimes can gang up on the party for a series of non-stop battles; it is possible to avoid battles by walking past or running away from enemies. The game has distinct humorous undertones in graphics and animation.

Description=The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell. Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back at the demons.<br><br>id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective. Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order. The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level.<br><br>The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them. Switches and buttons must be <br>pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.<br><br>DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas, pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the levels.<br><br>Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons), hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.<br><br>DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets, shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain gun is important.<br><br>DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.<br><br>The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion, plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls, pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against one or two especially powerful creatures.<br><br>DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in <br>a random location after being killed.

Description=A group of adventurers, led by the young mercenary named Guy, arrives at the Port City, looking for job. The situation in the city is not a very peaceful one: corrupted officials, thugs roaming the streets, nobility who won't listen to the pleas of simple people. Guy and his two initial companions, Quinn and Goran, must first find more people to join their party. But as  more adventurers join, the city is overrun by monsters, and Guy realizes it's not about finding job any more - it's about protecting the entire country.<br><br>Even though it was made by a Japanese company, Early Kingdom is more similar to Western RPGs, being more exploration-oriented rather than focusing on characters and their personal stories. Graphically, it discards the traditional Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in favor of realistic character portraits. The entire game is played from top-down perspective. Combat is real-time, utilizing the characteristic  Kure Software engine with large parties of both playable characters and enemies, allowing massive battle scenes. The player can control only one character at a time, while the others fight on their own. Attacks are executed simply by bumping into enemies. The characters get experience points and level up from defeating monsters. There is no world map in the game, but a continuous world of wilderness areas and towns.

One day, he and his female classmates find a mirror in an abandoned house; when they touch the mirror, they are transported into the magical medieval land of Ekudorado. The hero must first find his classmates, who are scattered around this world, and then find a way to return to our reality...<br><br>The game is a mixture of three genres: standard Japanese adventure (with menu-based commands &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot;, etc.), strategy card-based game, and RPG. The interaction in &quot;friendly&quot; areas (towns etc.) is done in Japanese adventure fashion; however, in order to access them, the player has to move the hero on a linear path composed of dots; each dot represents an enemy encounter. The battles follow a rather complex set of card game rules. At each turn, the player is dealt a deck of five cards. There are three kinds of cards: Law, Neutral, and Chaos, and six categories: Black, White, Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind. Each card stands for a unique type of action; for example, a Light Law card restores HP, a Fire Neutral card attacks the enemy with fire, etc. It is also possible to use combination of cards (up to three at a time), which leads to various results (for example, paralyzing the enemy while healing the hero). Even though other characters join the hero, it is possible to use only one character with one deck of cards per battle. <br><br>The RPG angle is present in character-building system: the hero gains experience points and levels up.

Kojiroh has been struggling to make a living as a lone PI, but now luck seems to smile to him: the director of the Eldian International School, Mr. Ko, asks him to find a missing painting, supposedly of great value. At the same time, Marina is hired by the ambassador of the fictional Middle East republic Eldia to protect his daughter Mayako from terrorists. Switching between Kojiroh and Marina, you gradually find out the connection between the two cases and plunge deeper into a grand mystery that involves political struggle, scientific discoveries, and horrifying murders.<br><br>The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: you interact with the world by choosing appropriate commands from the menu (which is different for every location). There are no puzzles to solve, and you make progress in the game by examining the environments and talking to the characters. At certain points, you'll have to switch between the two characters and make them cooperate.<br><br>Also the game is considered hentai and contains a lot of sexual innuendo in the dialogues and images of half-naked girls, it has nearly no explicit nudity and no sex scenes.

Description=Expedition Amazon puts you in control of a team of 4 explorers on an expedition to map and study (i.e.: plunder) the ruins of the Incan civilization.  Your team consists of a Medic, a Field Assistant, a Radio Operator, and a Guard. After equipping your team with all the necessary supplies (don't forget the mosquito netting!) you travel to your base camp at the edge of the jungle where you will begin your journey.<br><br>You will quickly meet up with many of the hazards of the jungle as you explore, including hostile natives (hope your Guard is a good shot!), mosquitoes, disease, covered pits, wildlife, and more. Each of your team members has an "EL" rating which indicates how close he is to dying. Death comes quickly for new team members, but as your team gains experience by mapping more and more of the Amazon and Incan ruins, your EL rating goes up and your team members become quite a bit more effective at avoiding hazards. You also get an Efficiency Rating "ER" which is an overall score of your exploration completed and loot collected minus your money spent and the number of team members killed.<br><br>Once you have mapped a few sectors of jungle you will find some ruins with passages leading underground. Underground is a lot more hazardous than the jungle, as many of the pitfalls you encounter mean instant death if you don't have the proper equipment or your team was not alert. The natives are also a lot more numerous underground as well.  But don't worry, you can always replace members of your expedition. Besides, what does it matter if you lost your Field Assistant if the rest of your team is carrying out a bagful of gold and silver?

A group of survivors has escaped into a cave, and it is from there that the nameless hero of the game begins his adventure.<br><br>Similarly to Kinpukurin's earlier RPG  Free Will, Faladia combines elements of Japanese RPG (top-down navigation, random turn-based battles with simple mechanics, etc.) with a more "Western" approach to RPG design. The gameplay is focused on exploration rather than on linear advancement with scripted story events. Instead of the usual Japanese practice of assigning a few story-related party members, Faladia allows to recruit most of the NPCs the player encounters in towns (up to 9 active characters). The player can also choose one of the four ways of interaction with every NPC: neutral, "loving", haggling, and aggressive. Aggressive behavior invariably leads to fight; it is therefore possible to attack every NPC in the game (though in most cases it results in the death of the underpowered hero).

Description=The land of Logris is home to many races and nations: humans, elves, dwarves, centaurs, and others. It is divided into many small kingdoms, different nations trying to leave in peace with each other. But the queen of Ornic, one of these nations, had plans of her own. She sent her troops to the south, invading the kingdom of elves. The army of Ornic started conquering one country after the other. The king and queen of Cardic, a powerful country in the south, decided to stop the madness, sending their soldiers, under the commands of general Richmond, to find allies wherever possible and to defeat the army of Ornic.<br><br>First Queen is a mixture of RPG and strategy game with real-time combat. In a RPG fashion, the party of heroes roams the world, fighting enemies, buying items, and leveling up. However, the focus of the game is shifted towards recruiting soldiers and fighting against whole armies. The player-controlled unit may contain a dozen or more characters, and it is also possible to build more than one, making the player-controlled group more similar to an army than to a standard RPG-type party. This is the first  Kure Software Koubou game to utilize the so-called gucha-kyara ("mixed-up characters") combat system, which they later employed in several other games. The player is able to control only one character at a time; the others act according to the computer AI. Attacking an enemy is a matter of simply bumping into him. This system allows for large-scale battles, with the characters sometimes filling the entire screen, creating the "mixed-up" impression.

Instead of menu-based location choice of the previous games, the main character can actually walk on a world map with icons representing locations.

When the humans arrived, the cultural differences between the races were not enough to provoke a war, so for a while they co-existed peacefully. Afterwards, the humans have split into several smaller nations. The nation of Barcia in the north had a small population, and its king Zenel was worried his country will be conquered by others. To prevent that, he invited the dark magician Zon, who cast a spell over his soldiers. But nothing comes without a price. Insanity seized the king and its army. Barcia began invading other countries. A warrior named Ares and his friends try to assassinate the king, but as a result, Ares is thrown in prison. A mysterious man with magical powers saves Ares, telling him that it's time to sort out the differences between nations and races, and lead an army to stop the madness of Barcia...<br><br>The fourth entry in  First Queen series utilizes the trademark "mixed-up characters" battle system, with dozens of characters on both sides fighting each other in real time. The game features a new point-and-click interface, with battle tactics accessible at any moment from the battle screen. It is also possible to focus attacks on an enemy simply by clicking on him with the mouse. Compared to the previous entries, First Queen IV emphasizes the war game aspect, with less focus on RPG-like exploration and more strategic challenge. The movement on the map has grown into an important gameplay device: different armies move simultaneously, and the player has to pay attention for enemy forces advancing to different locations. It is possible to split units, create new ones, exchange soldiers, and send different units to different locations. An enemy army may join forces with the heroes upon defeat; diplomacy can also be used to make agreements with sovereign city-states. Once a location is clear of enemies, it is possible to "camp" and to direct other actions from there.

It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.<br><br>Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.

Description=By the end of the 20th century, women have acquired a prominent role in the human society. Entertainment, arts, and politics are increasingly dominated by women. Therefore, a special emphasis is put on educating young women, preparing them for the turbulent social life. The world's most prestigious educational institution is the Japanese Eikou High School. Becoming a teacher in that school is the highpoint of the career of the protagonist, Takigawa Noboru. But as it always happens (well, at least in  bishojo games), the moment the hero encounters all those gorgeous female colleagues and students, he forgets all about education...<br><br>Ikenai Hokago is a rather traditional Japanese-style adventure. It is set entirely in the school, and includes typical sub-locations such as classrooms, gym, teachers room, tennis court, etc. Every screen is accompanied by the verb commands Look, Talk, Examine, and Move. There are no sub-menus for interaction with objects. The player is mostly free to wander around the school (via the Move commands in the menu), but events are usually "triggered" by repeatedly visiting different locations.

Description=In late 23rd century was marked  by a terrible disaster - the Third World War. Years have passed since the countries affected by it started slowly rebuilding. A league of nations was formed, consisting of "companions" from different countries. Suzuki, the representative of Japan, was also the founder of the most prestigious school of the new era -  St. Innocence Girls High School. The graduates were invited to a grand opening held by a company that was successful in manufacturing giant robots. But terrorists of an unknown origin assaulted the place, killing most of the people. All the clues lead to St. Innocence school. Suzuki sends an agent (codename "Osamu") to infiltrate the school and find out what is happening.<br><br>The game is a Japanese-style RPG/strategy hybrid, set almost entirely within the high school. The RPG aspect is stronger than it is usually in games of this types, manifested itself not only in leveling system (experience points are awarded for each attack), equipment, usage of money, etc., but also in top-down exploration outside of the battles. Battles are usually dictated by the plot (not random), and occur in large top-down environments, which are navigated by the party of heroes in turn-based style.<br><br>Battles usually end with cut-scenes featuring nudity and sexual situations.

Description=Minako was just an ordinary Japanese teenage girl - until she was killed by an evil gym teacher, whom she dared to oppose. However, she was resurrected with the help of cyborg technology, operated by a mysterious creature with a normal Japanese surname Yoda - and yes, he looks just like the famous character from  Star Wars. Yoda explains to Minako that her school has been possessed by demons, one of which is her former gym teacher, now turned principal! Minako heads back to her school, determined to demonstrate her new skills to the forces of evil!<br><br>Looks like all those cybernetic enhancements served just one purpose: enrich Minako's knowledge of contemporary Japanese pop culture. Because the only gameplay in this game involves answering timed trivia questions. The moment Minako encounters an opponent, the screen displays a fake battle field, and the quiz begins. If the player answers correctly, Minako causes damage to her opponent; if the answer is wrong, Minako sustains damage herself. Too many wrong answers result in Minako's death, this time irrevocable.<br><br>Extensive cut-scenes occupy the space between those &quot;quiz battles&quot;. Most of them are heavy on explicit sexual content.

One day, a maniac breaks into the school, and, holding the protagonist and the students at gunpoint. He then holds them hostage and forces them to perform violent and humiliating sexual acts with each other.

Every situation offers a limited set of timed choices to the player.

There are also adventure elements in the game: at any time, pressing the Space key will bring a typical Japanese-style adventure interaction menu with options such as "Look", "Talk", etc. Movement outside of hostile areas is also done through menu commands.

Description=Wild Force is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as the  previous entry in the  GaoGao series. A virus turned most of the Earth's population into mutants, and human beings continued living in artificial cities, separated from the rest of the world. This time, the story is seen from the point of view of the mutants themselves (the previous GaoGao games had human protagonists). These look more like fairy tale creatures (half-cats, winged people, etc.), and continue living on the wild, dangerous Earth, keeping close to their respective animal tribes. The protagonist of the game is a young boy named Wolf, who belongs - you've guessed it - to the wolf tribe. One day, exploring the wilderness, he stumbles upon a strange cave with lurking monsters. Together with a girl from the rabbit tribe and other fantasy creatures, Wolf discovers an advanced civilization, learn of the existence of human beings, and eventually becomes a hero who saves the new world from a grave danger.<br><br>Gameplay-wise, Wild Force is identical to the previous GaoGao games.

The events of the game begin shortly after the end of the  previous installment. Human civilization is nearly destroyed; the remaining humans live in shelters, dreaming of the "promised land" Canaan, somewhere "near the end of the world", where there is enough food for everyone and where mutants can't enter. The game has two protagonists: a human boy who has lost his parents and who swears to himself to find Canaan, and Wolf, the mutant hero of the previous game, with his colorful female companions.

The player oversees a map of an entire galaxy and can choose to conquer (or protect) any of the planets, recruit and fire generals, manage space ship production, deployment, weaponry, etc. <br><br>Whenever there is a conflicting interest in a star system, the player is warned by an advisor. He then chooses to avoid the battle or engage the enemy. From that point on, the game plays similarly to its predecessors: the player moves the assigned units over the top-down battle space, engaging enemies in combat, which is automatic and is displayed as animated scenes.

Description=The fourth game in the  series based on Yoshiki Tanaka's Legend of the Galactic Heroes science fiction novels. The novels (and the games) are set in a futuristic world, where humanity has conquered the entire Milky Way and split into two powerful warring states, each encompassing different systems and planets: the Galactic Empire (modeled after Bismark's 19th century Prussia), and the democratic Free Planets Alliance. <br><br>Ginga Eiyu Densetsu IV follows the model used in the  third game, rather the pure combat-oriented gameplay of the first two. It expands and refines the gameplay elements that were first introduced in its predecessor. The player chooses the main "playable character", i.e. the commander of the entire army (Imperial or Alliance) from a list of generals. Financial management is more in-depth; including budget-planning, funds management, salaries, etc. Sending space ships to conquer and defend planets is done the same way as in the previous game. In fact, the preparations turn into the core of the gameplay, and it is possible to disable the actual combat phases.<br><br>If is is are enabled, the combat evolves in a fashion similar to the previous games: the player engages enemy ships in turn-based fashion, and combat is shown as animated scenes. There are more ship types with unique names and abilities, as well as massive attacks that can be performed by the forces stationed on the planet.

As the hero embarks on his journey, he realizes that he must have chosen a wrong destination, for he becomes stranded on a tropical island that seems to be populated entirely by women. No, the hero does not abandon his world-saving mission because of that; but in order to leave the island, he needs to perform various quests for its young and pretty female inhabitants, which more often than not involve demonstrating... err... somewhat intimate aspects of his heroic nature.<br><br>Girls Paradise is an adventure game without real puzzles and with menu-based interface; however, it differs from most typical Japanese adventures by allowing (and requiring) the player to find and pick up certain items and then use them from the inventory to advance in the game. The story progression relies more on direct dialogue and usage of items than on "triggering" events by repeatedly selecting commands. It is possible to look and otherwise interact with objects by moving the arrow keys and highlighting the object on screen. The interaction is still quite limited, though; not every screen has interactive objects, and most of the time the hero is allowed to move between locations only when dictated by the story.

However, the game doesn't pause when the shooting occurs, creating the illusion of real-time combat.<br><br>Though the game looks like a first-person shooter, it is, in its core, an RPG. Player-controlled robot receives experience and levels up after having defeated certain amounts of enemies. Attack, defense, speed, etc. get increased with each level up. It is possible to find and equip various kinds of weapons: a basic gun with infinite ammo, but low damage; powerful rocket launchers which cause high damage, yet have limited ammunition, etc. Two weapons can be equipped in each hand, and the player can switch between them during combat. Shields can also be found and equipped. Weapon energy, body ("health"), and shield energy can be restored with appropriate items.<br><br>An updated version of the game (with enhanced graphics and view angles) was later released in The West under the name  Space Griffon VF-9.

But while the focus on the story is on Kazuhiko and his quest for physical intimacy (which often results in girls getting angry and beating him up), there are other rather disturbing elements that come into play later - in particular, bunny-like demons who share Kazuhiko's passion for the opposite sex...<br><br>The game is a typical Japanese adventure gameplay-wise, with the interaction consisting of choosing verb commands from a menu, often needing to deplete all the options before being able to proceed. There is also navigation on the map of the town and the high school (menu-based). Most of the commands are of "Look" and "Talk" variety, but they get much more specific when it comes to Kazuhiko "interacting" with the girls. There is no point-and-click interface even there, though; the entire game is played by choosing menu commands.

A woman who calls herself the Goddess of Time appears and tells him that Gargantua is about to be revived. Cain first tries to ignore the dream, but soon a series of strange events convinces him that the time has come to prove himself a hero.<br><br>Harlem Blade is a rather traditional Japanese RPG with top-down navigation (can be done with arrow keys or in a point-and-clck fashion with the mouse) and a world-map with linear routes. Enemies appear at pre-set points, without a separate battle screen. It is possible to speed up the battles by setting them on Auto.

He stays in a boarding house in the country, enjoying the quiet life, the sea, the beach, and the abundance of those he likes most... So all goes well, until one of the guests who was staying at the boarding house is killed. Not entirely trusting the police, the owner of the boarding house asks Gen to look into this.

Several years ago, when he was too young and not considerate enough, he convinced a girl named Reiko to play strip mahjong with him. Later the hero understood that what he did was wrong; Reiko was just a child back then. His atonement was perhaps a bit strange; he traveled to China, and studied there the game of mahjong. So now he is back, and he is determined to invite the now fully-grown Reiko (and other pretty girls in the town) to... more strip mahjong games!<br><br>The game unfolds pretty much the way you'd expect from a strip mahjong game: the player must beat the girls in mahjong, one by one.

Takashi and his recruited "stars" gain levels according to their success. Takashi also has two other parameters, "Power" and "HP". "Power" is Takashi's stamina, which depletes regularly and can be restored with food, sleep, medicine, etc. "HP" in this game is the amount of work stress the protagonist has. Too much HP will require him to "release the stress" by various means - for example visiting a brothel.

"Scenario 5" is a rare example of "mainstream" eroge which deals with a male homosexual relationship. The adult content here is text-only; there are no graphics that depict explicit sex.

The episode is dedicated only to one day of the hero's life; during this day, he must locate and convince a girl to have a date with him. Depending on the player's choices, the story develops in various different directions from there.<br><br>3.

Description=The game is based on the anime Science Ninja Team Gatchaman (also known under differently translated titles Battle of the Planets  and G-Force). Set in the future, it describes the adventures of a team of five young superheroes under the command of Dr. Nambu, the head of the International Science Organization, whose goal is to fight evil aliens known as the Galactor. Led by the mysterious Berg Kattse and aided by a robotic construct known as the Turtle King, the Galactor are trying to steal uranium in order to create more machines and conquer the world. The Ninja Team is lead by Ken Washio and includes three other boys and one girl.<br><br>The game is mainly a Japanese-style adventure with simple turn-based battles with isometric perspective thrown in. There is no RPG system or character growth of any kind. All the battles are pre-set and dictated by the plot. There is no movement on the battle screen. Typically, the party of five heroes must fight several waves of enemies. The heroes have different parameters, but use the same techniques. Special attacks require Special Points (SP), which are gradually restored as the battle progresses. In the beginning of any battle, the player has to choose one of the characters and can only control him/her; it is possible to switch to another character only if the first one dies. There are also battles in vehicles, unique for each character; however, they follow the exact same pattern. Most of the game is spent repeatedly clicking on the characters' portraits in different order to advance the dialogue. There are some "Yes/No" decisions, but in many cases the game will only "agree" with whatever decision advances the plot. During a few segments, it is also possible to interact with the environment through a typical Japanese command menu ("Look", "Move", etc.).

The player controls a lone Japanese jet, making its way through hostile areas, beginning with the defense of Hokkaido and advancing into enemy territories. The enemies include other jets, helicopters, ships, stationary cannons, tanks, and other military vehicles and machines. The player-controlled jet has a basic attack with unlimited ammunition, as well as several powerful attacks of limited usage, such as a fire blast that destroys an entire row of enemies, etc. As in most games of this kind, the levels are punctuated by mini-boss and stage boss battles. Running out of lives results in the Continue screen, forcing the player to restart the level.

As in most Japanese adventures, the interaction is done via verb commands selected from the menu. The player clicks on an object, which bring up the menu with the commands. However, while there are still no real puzzles, the challenge lies in completing certain actions in time, in order to avoid time paradoxes while staying in the past. The player must explore thoroughly the rooms of the four girls and figure out a way to conquer them.

Now Ryoko trains to become the best martial artist, taking on the best fighters in the country...<br><br>Kakuto Musume Ryoko is structured like a fighting game, but in reality it is primarily a turn-based card game. The game has two modes, Story and Exhibition. The story mode allows the player to control Ryoko between the cut scenes, fighting female opponents as dictated by the story. The exhibition mode allows the player to fight controlling any of the characters that appear in the story mode.<br><br>The fights are always one-on-one. The player is dealt a deck of five cards, each representing a certain fighting move (attack, defense, heal, etc.). cards of the same type can be used in an accumulative way, increasing their effect.

However, too intense tapping might result in the protagonist's premature ejaculation, forcing the player to replay the whole scene.

Different characters will join Vossgen on his quest (up to three companions at a time). The battle commands are more complex than usually in Japanese RPGs, having three types of attack - close, normal, and far; close attacks deal more damage, but expose the character more, etc. This applies to physical attacks, magical spells (elemental disciplines), as well as special technique. There are also a few instances when the player is able to make moral choices, which will change Vossgen's karma, and possibly influence the ending.

With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.<br><br>There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre.

When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared!  Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears.  He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it.  Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides.  Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.<br><br>King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface.  Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands.  To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag.  By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area.  Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at".  The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects.  The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too).  Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors.  Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag.  By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has.  In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.<br><br>As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die.  Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise.  The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.

It was known as the Blade of Darkness. The dragon was defeated, and the sword disappeared after the battle. Now, unholy people attempt the resurrection of the Black Dragon. Shinobu Ryudo, a young girl from the Dark-Haired tribe, begins a long and perilous journey across the main continent to find the sword and prevent the dragon's resurrection. Meanwhile, the warrior Kayes is instructed by the oracle to look for the sword as well. Will the heroes join forces to defeat the evil?..<br><br>Kuro no Ken is a rather standard Japanese-style RPG with all the familiar ingredients: top-down locations, navigation on the world map, random enemies, turn-based combat, automatic leveling up, etc. The battles are viewed from a third-person perspective, using much larger character sprites than during exploration. Shinobu and Kayes can use physical attacks or magic spells (learned automatically when leveling up), which deplete MP.

Description=1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. <br>This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...<br><br>"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre,  Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.

The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.<br><br>Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic  Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies.

Description=Last Guardian 2: Yomi no Fuin is a direct sequel to the  first game in the  Last Guardian series. It continues the unfinished story of the first game -  the adventures of a group of heroes from the Beast nation. The sequel focuses on two of the previous game's main characters, Badio and his sweetheart Miriana. Traveling by ship, the couple arrives in a small city in the Eastern continent, where they meet a dying warrior from the Dragon tribe, who is holding a child in his arms, begging the heroes to bring him safely to his people. But Badio and his friends know it won't be easy, when they are attacked by a group of Beast Hunters, and when the powerful enemies continue plotting their schemes against the heroes...<br><br>The gameplay is very similar to that of the first game, with a few minor changes. As before, there is no exploration or movement outside the battles; the entire game consists of long strategic fights and cut scenes. Once again, the player has access to beast transformation for the characters in the party. The player-controlled characters level up automatically, but this time can level up in the middle of the battle. The &quot;Defend&quot; command is now available, requiring 1 action point. Some changes were made to the interface (different icons, design of the menus, etc.), but otherwise, nothing essential has been changed compared to the previous game.

Many years ago, two of the gods fought each other, until the god Gaduros emerged victorious, imposing a harsh rule over the nation of the winged Beasts. But the beautiful goddess Typhon defeated Gaduros. It looked like the age of peace finally began. But when the Beasts discovered an ancient disc-like artifact, everything went wrong again. A warrior from the nation of Centaurs and a mysterious religious cult suddenly became very interested in the artifact, making it clear to the Beasts that they will have to fight for their lives. And so three of them - two young friends, Rezak and Maxen, and their older comrade Badio - started a dangerous journey across the world, to find out what their enemies' intentions truly are...<br><br>The game is a mixture of RPG and strategy. As in most RPGs, the player controls a party of characters (up to 7), who gain experience points from fighting enemies and level up. However, there is no exploration of any kind and no movement outside of the battle field in the game. The game consists of long strategic battles and cut scenes, most of which are presented as still anime-style shots that advance the story. The turn-based battles allow free movement on the battle field. Each action (movement, physical attack, spell, etc.) requires a certain amount of action points. Beside the usual attacks, some player-controlled characters can transform into various types of beasts. While in "beast mode", the character gains access to new abilities, but might lose some of those he/she had while in human-like form.

Description=A long time ago, humans possessed unique power, that allowed them to create wonderful things and to build a highly advanced civilization. But it all ended when the chariots of the terrifying Death God attacked and destroyed the beautiful cities beyond the skies. Humans have lost their memories. And the magical powers from before started serving evil intentions...<br><br>Although a Japanese game,  Lunatic Dawn is much more similar to "old-school" Western RPGs than to its compatriots. For once, it is not a story-driven game. There are almost no scripted events, very few dialogues, etc. The overall theme of the game is quite abstract: the cities serve as places to buy equipment and learn combat techniques, but have no real locations (everything is accessed via a menu). <br><br>The game is dedicated to character creation, RPG-style character development, and exploration. In the beginning, the player creates the playable character, choosing age, gender, and even weaknesses - all of which affect the character's parameters such as stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc. Afterwards, the player allocates points into the remaining parameters. The player starts in a city and is absolutely free to go wherever he/she wants. There is a day/night cycle in the game. It is necessary to keep an eye on the character's stamina and buy food rations - the character can die of exhaustion and hunger. Random enemies appear on the world map and in dungeons. Battle screen is isometric and allows free movement. It is not necessary to choose a command for each turn: the battles evolve automatically until the player interrupts them with a new command.

Description=Like other  Lunatic Dawn games, Lunatic Dawn II is, despite its Japanese origins, an exploration-oriented Western-style RPG. There is no main story line in the game, beside the cryptic mentioning of a legendary group of heroes who fought demons and as a result became demons themselves in the introduction sequence. There are no "main goal"in the game, and no plot-advancing events; it is entirely dedicated to free-form exploration and role-playing.<br><br>In the beginning, the player creates the main character (default name Lunatic), choosing gender and background - social status, strengths and weaknesses, etc. All this affects the parameters of the character, which include strength, stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc.<br><br>Like in the  previous Lunatic Dawn game, the gameplay revolves around exploring the vast game world. The graphics are much more detailed in this installment, with actual locations within a city. There are more shops and places of interest to visit in each city, including the ruler's castle, as well as horse stables, where it is possible to buy a carriage to quickly transport to another city. It is possible to "call the master" in every location; some of the masters will join the main character. Also available for recruiting are various NPCs staying in the inn (a party can contain up to six characters). The NPCs have names and different abilities/parameters, but no distinct personalities. As before, there is a real day-by-day calendar in the game, and it is necessary to buy food rations for several days ahead if the player is planning a long journey. "Jobs" are available at the inns of various cities, which include treasure hunt, monster-eliminating, etc. The heroes get paid for completing those tasks. <br><br>Roaming the top-down world map, the party can enter dungeons, which are viewed from an isometric perspective. Enemies are visible on the screen, and a turn-based battle initiates upon contact. The player can assign general strategies to the whole party, but is only able to control directly the main character. The party acts according to its AI, and the rest of the battle evolves automatically until the player interrupts it to input new commands.

Digal plunged into chaos, crime began to flourish, bandits roamed the countryside uncontrolled. <br><br>At this tough time, a young man named Rezas joined the Magic School, where the most beautiful and skillful female magicians were training at that time. But the next day, the school was attacked by a gang of criminals, and most of the people there killed. Rezas and his pretty schoolmates swear to avenge this crime and bring peace back to the kingdom.<br><br>Mado Gakuen R is a mixture between Japanese-style RPG and turn-based strategy. There is free movement in towns, but the exploration is limited by restricting the player-controlled characters to a linear world map. Battles occur at pre-set locations, so instead of the usual dungeon exploration there are strategic battles, with turn-based movement on the battle screen. Characters attack physically or use healing, status-changing and offensive magic.

She must now escape a dungeon and defeat the evil minotaur that has been sent to destroy her.<br><br>All three games share the same engine and gameplay mechanics, playing as first-person RPGs in which your main view is composed of a 2.5D view of the dungeons you are trapped in, and the rest of the interface is used to give graphic feedback to the player instead of relying on stats and numbers (for instance, a picture of Arle serves as the means of telling how damaged she is, and a group of gems that encircle the screen show how closer you are to advancing a level).

There's also a fair amount of puzzle solving and plenty of NPCs to run across in each dungeon, all being characters from the Puyo Puyo series.

However, the strength of the generals, soldiers, etc. is measured by points calculated in mahjong games, with mahjong stones representing various types of military forces. Every confrontation with the enemy is a game of mahjong; it can be set on auto, and the outcome will be decided depending on the player's preparation for the battle.

You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.

Description=In Metal Eye, the player takes the role of a young weapons expert named Windir. His father was apparently involved in a project that dealt with creating artificial life forms. But recently he has disappeared without a trace. Windir remained alone, in a small town surrounded by vicious monsters. He wants to become a hunter, just like his father once was, to get rid of the monsters roaming the wilderness, and to get to the bottom of his father's disappearance and his mysterious project.<br><br>Metal Eye is a rather typical Japanese RPG, with Windir and his companions (who join the party later) wandering around the vast world map, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat (first-person view). Characters can equip different types of weapons, including various guns (rifles, shotguns, etc.) with expendable bullets. There are scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.

Description=Metal Eye 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe and is closely related story-wise to the  first game. In the future, people have built the floating city Zeron, where the best scientists work on creating androids, artificial human beings who look the same way as real ones. Harvest Corporation is the biggest company that creates androids. The hero of the game is a scientist named Wirg, whose work is to train the androids after they have been created. One day, the company building is attacked, and Wirg has to escape. He is saved by a nun and brought into a small town in the middle of wasteland, where his adventure begins.<br><br>Metal Eye 2 mostly follows a traditional Japanese RPG template: Wirg and his companions (a party of three) explore the top-down world and fight random enemies in turn-based combat in first-person view. The pictures of enemies appear super-imposed on whatever location the characters are currently in, without separate battle screens. The towns have isometric perspective. Like its predecessor, "Metal Eye 2" has a large world map that consists of many separate screens, often include dungeon-like locations.

But one day she meets too imp-like creatures, one of whom is Pal, the 153rd prince of a magical world called Dream Star, and the other his court magician Pul. The two turn Mai into an adult young woman, and she begins to explore her newly found sexuality...<br><br>This is a Japanese adventure game with linear story progression. The interaction consists mainly of small command menus, until the heroine becomes intimate with another character. At such times, the interface changes to sexual commands ("touch", "lick", etc.), which lead to a point-and-click interaction with the partner's body; often the player then assumes the role of Mai's partner, with Mai herself becoming the "object".

But all changes when the dragon rider Kain finds an ancient weapon known as the Rune Blade. He brings it to the old white dragon Yoshua, who tells him that a powerful protective artifact has been stolen, and the fateful hour has come to Akranis... with the help of his dragon Sarken, Kain has to restore peace and save Akranis and the dragon race.<br><br>The game is a rather unusual example of a side-scrolling action game, in which the player controls a dragon. Sarken is able to fly in any direction, but so are the enemies in the game, most of which are other dragons. The dragon has a HP bar which is depleted when he is damaged by enemy attacks or traps. Beside physically attacking, the dragon can also learn and cast offensive and protective magical spells.

Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop the alien invasion into Varn.<br><br>This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing games in general.

As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.

Description=Military Madness is a futuristic turn-based strategy war game.  The year is 2089 and the setting is Earths moon, which yields many important resources.  While the governments of Earth bicker over their staked claims on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using its factories to produce advanced weaponry, the most devastating of which is the SAM (Supreme Atomic Missile).  As commander of the Allied forces, it is the players responsibility to lead whats left of the Allied armies in a desperate offensive against the Axis Empire on the lunar surface before they can use the SAM to destroy Earth.<br><br>There are 32 maps (2 different campaigns with 16 maps each) to play through.  In each map, the player must strategically defeat the outnumbering Axis forces either by destroying all enemy units or capturing the enemy base camp.  There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks, aircraft, artillery, and a few others that have specialized functions.  Gameplay consists of moving units into positions that will gain the best advantage to attack the enemy, capitalizing on many factors, which include battle experience, terrain, support tactics, and - sometimes - pure luck.

Description=The third  Mokkoriman game is perhaps  Illusion's most unusual genre experiment: a fishing game with sex. No, there is no sex with fish in this game. Instead, the super-hero Mokkoriman (his super-power being his unparalleled ability to sexually satisfy women) and his two female side-kicks that were fighting together with him in  Mokkoriman RPG, Oppain and Futomomon, have to fish (literally) women out of pools, bath tubs, etc. The player can choose to control either of the three, even though it doesn't affect the gameplay. It is possible to choose one of the seven available stages (each with a different woman) right from the beginning, with the eighth stage ("office lady") hidden. The fishing simulation part consists of two parts, both fairly simple. The entire game is controlled with the left mouse button. First, the player has to click at the right time when the hook is deep in the water. Then the woman will be pulled out of the water, caught by a part of her clothes. The player is taken to a new screen, which requires him to press and hold the mouse button, releasing it at the right moment and then pressing again, to successfully pull up the woman. <br><br>What follows next is a regular point-and-click sex simulation (no Illusion-style real-time mouse movement), which involves clicking on the woman's different body parts to make her enjoy.

They appear randomly, and the level can be considered completed when the player has unlocked all three.

Description=Necronomicon is - as the title strongly implies - based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. The story is set in Lovecraft's fictional city Arkham somewhere in New England. It is said that a terrible ritual has taken place there, involving a woman giving birth to a demonic child. A journalist named Jonathan heads to Arkham to find out more about the dreadful rumors, and to explore the ruins of an ancient monastery. In the town, Jonathan meets other characters with their own agendas. Terrifying nightmares, like visions from the past, haunt Jonathan. Will he be able to preserve his sanity and solve the mystery?<br><br>Necronomicon plays like a traditional Japanese-style adventure, having no puzzles at all (even though there is a rudimentary inventory in the game). However, unlike most Japanese adventures, it uses a simple point-and-click interface for interaction. Navigation is done either through a menu command, or by selecting a location on the map of Arkham.<br><br>Despite the game's connection to Lovecraft stories, its graphics are distinctly Japanese, mostly following anime-manga-style aesthetics. There are disturbing scenes in the game, as well as scenes with nudity.

Like in the first game, there are timed tasks (mostly involving enemy encounters), during which the player has to perform an action before time runs out. Failure to do so, or performing an incorrect action, leads to Game Over.

Description=In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. <br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.<br><br>During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

Description=Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.<br><br>The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment. <br><br>There are two scenarios available in the game: <br><br>1. Warlords: 1560 A.D.<br>The first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.<br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.<br>The second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals. <br><br>Samurai<br>The game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief. <br><br>Each samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level). <br><br>Strategy<br>The game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player's time table.<br><br>The game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in a particular month. Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of "Body Points" that represent the attention he can afford to spend on an action. Each action has a cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he does not have the points necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little each month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level of his Political skill. Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then require turns of inaction to stock up again, so timing actions to coincide with Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of resources.<br><br>Combat<br>Each samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size.<br><br>Unit Types<br>The game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry (Inf), Cavalry (Cav), and Rifles (Rif). Each unit type has certain special abilities and tactical advantages/disadvantages in combat:<br><br>1. Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map (explained later) and have 4 movement points; <br>Cavalry have the ability to charge at an enemy (inflicting considerable damage on both sides) with the chance of breaking through the defending unit and emerging on the other side. Samurai leaders may often be killed (instead of captured) if their unit reaches zero. Cavalry have 6 movement points; Rifles may attack using muskets which have devastating offensive capabilities, which may also kill an enemy samurai unit if the opponent's unit reaches zero (thus, a standard non-rifle attack is also available for capturing an enemy samurai leader). Rifles have 3 movement points.<br><br> <br>Additionally, both Infantry and Rifle units may move over walls or through water during the castle siege for a certain amount of movement points.<br><br>Tactical Combat<br>Tactical combat occurs in two different locations:<br><br>The first is the tactical map of the fief, where the attackers first arrive and the defenders surrounding the castle. In this setting, each days is divided into three time periods: morning, afternoon, and night, before the day ends. At night, armies may maneuver to surprise attack enemies in the dark, which does considerably more damage than an average attack. This may be done if the enemy is at least two squares away (not adjacent).<br><br>The second is the castle siege map, which occurs if the defender chooses to retreat to the castle from the previous map. Here, each turn represents one day, thus the time limit of the attack as well as the provisions of both sides, rapidly decrease with each turn. In this setting, the siege force must break down gates leading towards the castle for the final engagement. The defender is defeated, if the governor of the fief retreats, or if his unit is destroyed: resulting either in his capture or death.<br><br>The end outcome is either the fall of the fief to the attacking forces or victory for the defenders. Either way, captured samurai (if any) will require a prompt response for release, beheading, or recruitment to the winner's force.

Description=In Panic Dolls, three ordinary Japanese school girls suddenly discover that Miki, their school nurse, is in fact a "Master Dragoon", a super-heroine fighting for a powerful galactic organization. Their current adversary is the evil warlord Barado and his emissary, the sexy yet deadly monster-summoner Kyuuma. The three girls turn into the super-heroines Phoenix Rose, Tiger Lily, and Tortoise Cheery - the Power Dolls - and venture into Barado's dungeons to defeat him once and for all...<br><br>...only the player won't be helping them. In a sudden twist, the player is given control of the evil Kyuuma. The girls are automatically walking through the isometric, maze-like dungeons, trying to find the exit. The player's goal is to help Kyuuma summon monsters to stop them. As the girls walk, their attack level increases (from 0 to 4), and so does Kyuuma's summoning level. At level 4, she can summon the most powerful monsters in each category (giants, demons, spirits, etc.). When the monster is placed into the dungeon, it will try to find its way to the girls. Depending on the girls' level and the monster's level, the battle will decrease the girls' level by a certain number. The trick is to position different monsters in such a way that the girls will have to face a monster when they are all at level 0. Losing a battle at level 0 will cause a girl to become disoriented and wander off, turning into easier prey for the monsters, and eventually getting killed in a battle.<br><br>The game doesn't stop if the girls successfully traverse a dungeon. The player can simply let them walk and advance to the next dungeon screen. Depending on where and how the player disposes of the girls, the game ends with a different scene.<br><br>The game has cut-scenes with explicit sexual content.

Description=The time for resurrecting historical events has come. Panzer General was one of the first games (if not the first) that actually gave you the ability to play for the Nazis, and yet succeed where Hitler failed. Having total and complete control over land, sea and air units, you must defeat the Allied dogs as fast as you can (to get a major victory), or slower than in history (to get the minor victory).<br><br>The game's quality lies in the quantity of units. There are basically hundreds of Axis and Allied units from World War II, accompanied with "circled" animations and battle sounds, as well as marching or moving sounds. The Main menu is always located on the right side of the screen, with plenty of options and selections you can change to suit your preferences.<br><br>A turn-based hexagon strategy game that will actually go faster if you have faster computer, but will always be playable (speed doesn't go up infinite). The first and original Panzer General, this installment would be followed by sequels and many other games in the series using the "General" name.

Looks like Lyann and Din have to hide for the time being, before they can think of a secure way to stop the enemies - which is anything but easy, since the enemy seems to possess advanced technology...<br><br>Amaranth III differs from its  predecessors in several ways. It has a more modern setting, with steam-punk elements. The gameplay system has been re-vamped, becoming closer to a strategy RPG than to an action RPG. As before, the battles feature free movement, but it is turn-based now, with action points for each characters; the character can act as long as he/she still have action points left. There is a "Vigour" system that keeps track of characters' stamina; once the vigour is lowered, the character begins to lose hit points. Using special items and resting in inns restores vigour. <br><br>The game also makes a step towards strategy RPGs by focusing less on exploration and more on pre-set, story-dictated battles. However, the small number of controllable characters and the ability to explore prevents it from being a full-fledged strategy RPG.

Description=Tetsuya is a rather ordinary Japanese teenager, who prefers hanging out with his sweetheart Rika than going to school. His passion are 3D video games. The newest game machine which allows the player to completely submerge into the virtual world, modeled according to his desires, has captured his heart. But one thing is strange: lately, Tetsuya keeps seeing himself as a killer and rapist. Dreams begin to haunt him. Is this just a side-effect of the game, or does he have a dark side he knows nothing about? Or maybe the game took him to another world, which will from now on become part of his life?..<br><br>The larger portion of Power Slave plays like a Japanese adventure, most of the gameplay being dedicated to choosing locations from the town map, triggering events and advancing the story. The omnipresent "Look - Talk - Move" menu appears at some locations. However, there are also several turn-based battles in the game. Those battles are always story-related, take place on an isometric screen, and are fought against a single enemy. Tetsuya can attack physically, defend, or spend two turns concentrating his spiritual energy in order to execute a special attack. The key to winning the battles lies in predicting the opponent's move, which can be deduced from their dialogue lines.<br><br>Power Slave has explicit sex scenes. Unlike in most other similar games, many of them are animated, using 2D anime-style graphics.

Description=Premium consists of four scenarios, each one of which is dedicated entirely to sex (sometimes with a bit of conversation and very straight-forward seduction before). There is no real story, just a series of encounters of nameless protagonists with different types of young women. Each of the four scenarios is dedicated to a specific occupation, which are: school girl, maid, magician, and finally Buddhist nun. <br><br>The gameplay is very simple; even though there are verb commands, they are always situation-specific, and the player can advance the game by going through the few commands to trigger the next scene, which makes Premium more of a visual novel than an adventure.

Description=Gery is a 16-year old princess. One day, her father tells her about a tradition in their family: each time a princess turns sixteen, the king sends her to a tower, where she will remain locked until she solves all its puzzles and proves herself worthy of her royal title.<br><br>Princess Confusion is a puzzle game. It has two modes, Story and Game. In the Story mode, the princess has to complete the puzzle rooms in a specific order, while the Game mode allows the player to choose any of the available 24 levels.<br><br>Each level is a top-down room with a black hole and several balls marked with different letters scattered around. The goal of the game is to sink all the balls marked with the letter N into the hole. The only available action in the game is to push a ball; the princess can do it simply by simply walking near it and keep pressing the direction button.<br><br>Naturally, getting the N balls into the hole involves more than just pushing them; typically, they are inaccessible in their starting position. In order to move them into a spot from which the princess can push them, the player has to manipulate other balls. Balls marked U, D, R, and L (up, down, right, and left) change the gravity center of the level. When pushed into the black hole, they make all other balls roll into the corresponding direction. The princess herself loses the ability to walk in the opposite direction once the corresponding ball has been sunk. Balls marked B explode when the princess pushes them. The objective is to figure out the correct combination and order of moves (sometimes quite complex) to create appropriate conditions for sinking the N balls into the hole.

Description=In 21th century, there are three main powers on the Earth. The free world and the communist block carried over from the 20th century; the third power is the New Communist Federation. Since a program of denuclearizing was supported by all those powers, the New Communist Federation developed a devastating non-nuclear weapon: the satellite &quot;Raiden&quot;. The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship &quot;Septemius 1&quot; to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, &quot;Racoon&quot;, sent a strange message before stopping any communication.

An earlier installment of the series had been internationally published three years prior to Maxis A-Train by Seika Corp., under the name of Railroad Empire, with little to no public recognition.<br><br>In a goal-oriented approach, your task as a railroad tycoon is to build a trans-continental track that connects New York with California in the US scenario, England with Turkey on the (considerably more challenging) Europe map. With transportation service limited to passengers only and scheduling options minimized, creating smoothly running train lines is comparatively easy  just make sure that trains dont collide on the single-track lines. The main focus is on efficient track building using the A-Train, which you control directly. A limited supply of rails and geographical barriers such as rivers with few pre-constructed bridges make careful planning essential. Optional cargo trains help distributing building materials to the station closest to your A-Train. In a unique feature, days pass in an accelerated real-time day/night cycle, with track-building only possible during daylight and changes to train schedules and switches only allowed at night.

Description=Revery are people who know the secret way of magic. Few of those are left in the world, and unfortunately, not all of them use their powers for good...<br><br>Tyfana is a young girl who was living together with her father, Alfred. One day, a mysterious man named Wolfgang came to her father's house, demanding a magical artifact known as the Staff of Freya. Wolfgang cast a spell on Alfred, petrifying him. At the last moment, Alfred ordered Tyfana to grab the staff. Then he created a portal, and Tyfana disappeared...<br><br>The young girl finds herself in an unknown forest, with the staff in her hands. Armed with her newly acquired magical power, she swears to find a way to return home and rescue her father.<br><br>Revery: Izanai no Masuisho is an action role-playing game. There are no separate battle screens; the combat takes place on the exploration field. Unlike most action RPGs of this kind, the combat in the game is party-based. The player directly controls only Tyfana. Two other characters can join the party and fight, controlled by the AI; the player is able to assign general strategies to them (attack, defend, run away, etc.). Since Tyfana is armed with a staff and casts magical spells, the player-controlled combat in the game consists of long-ranged attacks that require aiming (the game pauses for that moment). Tyfana needs magic points to cast spells, which (like her HP) are gradually restored when she walks. She can equip rings, bracelets, and necklaces to enhance her defenses.<br><br>A somewhat unusual (for Japanese RPGs) feature of Revery: Izanai no Masuisho is the leveling-up system, which is controlled by the player. Every time Tyfana levels up, the player is given a certain amount of points, which he/she can freely use to raise any of the player character's attributes.

You see, Mokkoriman is famous for his... how should I say that... manly powers. That's why he is called "sei senshi", which means sex warrior. Mokkoriman is determined to make women happy (or so he thinks) by having sex with them. But the path to each beautiful woman is filled with dangerous creatures and traps. Death awaits our hero at every corner, so he must prove that his other super-powers - jumping and shooting - will be as effective as his main talent...<br><br>An early game by  Illusion, "Sei Senshi Mokkoriman" marks the beginning of this company's long tradition of fusing mainstream game genres with sex scenes. This particular game experiments with platform genre. It is a full-fledged platformer with complex levels that have to be solved in a unique way: there are teleporters that connect various areas of the level, and Mokkoriman can use them only if he has gathered enough energy - which he does when defeating enemies. If his energy count is too low, he should return and fight more enemies (which respawn on each screen). Mokkoriman has no melee attack: he shoots small energy balls at enemies. Various upgrades can be found, which enhance Mokkoriman's shooting abilities, making him shoot two or more balls.  Rather than instantly dying when hit by an enemy, Mokkoriman has a proper health bar. Health packs are also scattered around. <br><br>Each level ends with a sex scene between the hero and the "boss girl" of the level.  Trademark interactive sex scenes make their first appearance in this game, though in a rather basic form: the player has to hold a mouse button and quickly drag the mouse, imitating Mokkoriman's movements on screen. The goal is to fill the girl's "pleasure meter", while not running out of "spirit", as the game calls it (read: premature ejaculation is not an option!).

Description=The plot of Shinc is as simple as its title: the hero - aptly named Hero Narcissus - is a lone adventurer in search of a job. He arrives at a town which is populated mostly by young sexy women. The hero hasn't even enough money to visit the local brothel. Since the king hasn't asked him to rescue a princess (yet), his first quest, given to him by the pretty weapon shop owner, is to venture into a nearby cave, "Realm of Anguish", to defeat the monsters lurking there and retrieve valuable items. Naturally, this is just the beginning of a long career, which involves saving the kingdom and becoming a true hero.<br><br>The gameplay of Shinc is also very unpretentious: it's a first-person dungeon crawler with a basic combat system. Enemies pop up randomly, and the player inputs general commands ("Auto", "Offense", etc.) to deal with them in turn-based fashion. As per RPG rule, player characters gain experience points and money from fallen enemies, advancing in levels. In towns there is no physical movement, and interaction is done through command menu.<br><br>There are scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.

Description=The game is based on the animated movie Legend of Crystania, which is set in the same universe as  Record of Lodoss War, telling the story of two of its characters, Ashram and Pirotessa, escaping to the cursed land of Crystania and falling into the hand of animal gods. The game, however, doesn't follow this plot and instead is focusing on Crystania's internal troubles, particularly the evil Dragon God, whom the animal gods must defeat. The player can choose to play as either the female warrior Jenoba from the country of Istaria, or Pirotessa's former companion Boakes. The two adventures have different plots and begin in different locations. <br><br>The game's exploration is on par with other Japanese top-down RPGs, including towns and hostile areas, but without a world map. The battles are pre-set. Once the player-controlled party encounters a hostile character, a turn-based battle begins. The combat has a strategy element, allowing character to freely move on the battle field and attack only if enemies are within the range of their weapons. Characters can cast magical spells or use "talents", which deplete TP, or "talent points".

Description=Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.<br><br>As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. <br><br>If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. <br><br>There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). <br><br>Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. <br><br>Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. <br><br>How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.

Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.

In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.<br><br>The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.

Description=Following his humorous adventures in Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon, Roger Wilco is relaxing at his favorite pub somewhere in time and space when heavily armed soldiers enter the room. Carrying a parting message from Roger's old nemesis, Sludge Vohaul, they plan to get rid of the janitorial hero, execution style. That is until a man with an over-sized hair dryer helps Roger escape through a time rip into the future.. Now Roger Wilco has woken up on his home planet, sometime in Space Quest XII. The series has gone to ruin without it's hero, Vohaul rules all.. Roger must quickly hotwire a time pod and undo Vohaul's plot. The most logical way to do this is to run amok through past, future and the end of the universe, having a few laughs along the way. If there's a few spare moments, he might swing by the galaxy's biggest mall, charm his ex-girlfriend whom he knows nothing about and provoke some brawly monochrome bikers living in the original graphics of Space Quest I.<br><br>Space Quest IV is the first in the Space Quest series to feature Sierra's SCI interface (better known as "VGA icons").

Description=The Princess Blue was a trading vessel. While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. As the only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue, you swear revenge... but it's a big and expensive universe. In order to upgrade and repair the ship, you'll need credits. Which could be obtained through trading or hunting down pirates or maybe a special mission or two. There's also the matter of finding those who are responsible for the death of the Princess Blue. Following their trail will require obtaining information from several different characters.<br><br>Space Rogue is a space simulation, a predecessor to Origin's better known Wing Commander series and specifically, Wing Commander: Privateer. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. <br><br>Interstellar travel, between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where you must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at your ship, so the faster you can get through them, the more armor your ship retains. Finally, when docked on most locations, the game shows your pilot from a top-view and you can walk to different shops/bars/characters.

Like in most other games in this series, the story revolves around the main character's effort to have sex with every female character, including school mates and colleagues in part-time jobs.<br><br>The gameplay is identical to the one in Ribbon or in the  previous Bangai-hen: the player proceeds through still screens, typically depleting the available menu commands (verbs and object sub-menus) until a new command appears or an event is triggered. Like in most other games in the series, there are multiple dead ends and possible actions that lead to premature end of the game.

Description=The third game in the  Tenshitachi no Gogo series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. In this installment, the player assumes the role of a male teacher in a high school. Many pretty female students (and pretty female teachers) surround the hero, but he only has one girl in mind: Haru Okamoto, whom he calls "his angel". In order to win her love, the hero will have to know her better - which also means knowing the secrets of students and teachers alike...<br><br>Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon is a Japanese-style (puzzle-less) adventure game. The player interacts with the environment by choosing verb commands ("Look", "Ask", "Search", etc.), which lead to sub-menus with object choices. The game mostly advances in a linear way, but at certain points the story can end prematurely, depending on the player's choice.

Usually the game allows the player to advance only upon depletion of all the possible commands. There are, however, right and wrong decisions, including story branches that will end in a Game Over.

Description=Long time ago, human beings believed in gods. But time has passed, and the humans stopped worshipping them. The gods got angry. The world plunged into chaos.

Description=The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. <br><br>Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.<br><br>This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. <br><br>Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

Description=Veil of Darkness is a adventure game with RPG elements featuring a fixed isometric perspective and a fair share of action-RPG style combat.<br><br>You take the part of a cargo pilot whose plane is shot down by a mysterious force while flying over a remote valley in Romania. A helpful village girl named Deirdre rescues you from the crash and takes you to her father Kiril, who informs you that your arrival via plane crash marks you as the chosen one who is prophesized to destroy Kairn. <br><br>Kairn is the local vampire lord who long ago murdered his father and brothers so he could inherit control of the valley. Ever since he's used his powers to cut off contact with the outside world Kairn has been living it up, torturing the villagers with madness and death, feeding off of them like livestock, turning the village women into his personal vampiress servants, and generally being a spoiled pain-in-the-butt.Meanwhile the villagers are miserable, as every day they face the possibility of either being devoured by werewolves, gnawed on by zombies, driven into stark raving lunatics, or turned into vampires by Kairn and his posse.<br><br>Since Kairn has cut off all ways out of the valley the only way you're going to leave is, as the old saying goes, over his dead body. That's not going to be very easy, however. Wild animals and unnatural creatures roam the countryside. While some villagers wise to help you rid them of Kairn, others have been driven mad with despair and by the valley's oppressive aura, causing them to commit unspeakable acts or otherwise act in an unhelpful manner. Even your most trusted allies may turn out to have a few skeletons in the closet...

The player chooses one of the six girls of the Jahana group and has once again to defeat all the others in battle before fighting Kotoe and her bodyguards.<br><br>The Bout of Cabalistic Goddess is the second game in the  Variable Geo series. It follows the same gameplay template as its predecessor: the player has to fight the other girls in a pre-determined order, winning two rounds out of three. There are five new girls to fight in this sequel. As before, the defeated fighters undergo various humiliating treatments of sexual nature. There are now three erotic scenes per girl, but it's possible to see them only after winning the whole battle, not one scene per round, as it was the case in the first game.

The player chooses one of the six available waitresses and has to defeat the other five to win the big prize.<br><br>There are no cut-scenes or story development in the game beside very short conversation snippets when characters finish the battle or during an adult scene. The player character has to win two battles out of three in order to advance to the next stage. Each successful round leads to an erotic scene: a mild one after the first round, a more hardcore one after the whole battle is won. The defeated girls are stripped down and sometimes humiliated in a sexual way. Each girl has standard moves (punch, kick, and their combinations while jumping or crouching), as well as character-specific techniques such as a long-range attack, throwing the opponents into air, choking the opponents, etc.

Description=Viper BTR is a direct sequel to the short story that was part of  Viper V-12, Magical Gambler. The original story was about a little girl named Ruri who received a magic wand from two dice-shaped familiars, and as a result turned into Chiyomi, a sexy gambling queen who abused her new powers to win money. In Viper BTR, the familiars return and give Ruri another chance to use her powers for good. However, she encounters Mai, another girl who underwent a similar transformation, thanks to her own familiar Domino. But unlike Ruri/Chiyomi, Mai uses her power for good. Will the heroine be able to join her or will envy and greed control her once again?<br><br>Viper BTR differs from other  Viper games by incorporating a new genre into the usual "choose-your-own-adventure" gameplay, namely mahjong. There is an obligatory mahjong match in the game that the heroine has to win, and also a special "mahjong mode", accessed from the main menu. The rest of the game consists of pictures with text as well as animated sequences; however, unlike in other Viper games, there is rudimentary navigation in "Viper BTR" (at certain points it is possible to choose a location to go to from a menu list). Also not quite typically for a Viper game, the story of "Viper BTR" is not composed entirely of pornographic scenes, and the sexual content is milder than in any other Viper game before.

Double Impact features two young female detectives, Miho and Kumi, who pretend to search for jobs as maids in order to infiltrate a mansion in which mysterious disappearances have been taking place.<br><br>All the three stories are very short and can perhaps be better described as "scenes"; the entire game can be completed within several minutes.

Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he's out for revenge.<br><br>At the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.<br><br>As Werdna, you'll slowly regain your magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany you on your journey. Your goal is to get to the surface and get your amulet (and hopefully a little revenge). But in your way are a variety of monsters, guardians, and gung-ho adventurers out for your head. Not to mention being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of your old enemy Trebor. Make it to the surface, and you'll have to face one final grudge match against the heroes who defeated you in the past before you can get your amulet.<br><br>Wizardry IV features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics that was used in the previous 3 Wizardry (and used one final time in Wizardry V). Unlike every other game in the entire series, you cannot import characters from the previous game (for obvious reasons). The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series. Wizardry IV is generally considered to be the most difficult game in the entire series, and experience with the other games in the series is recommended.

Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.

Description=Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!<br><br>In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.<br><br>Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.<br><br>Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).<br><br>Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).

Description=Long time ago, human beings, animals, and supernatural creatures lived together peacefully in the Garden of Eden. But a demon named Ibrus started a war against the god of time, and as a result the peaceful co-existence of different races ended. Humans were deported onto the Earth, where they formed five powerful kingdoms. The wisest of them, a king named Solomon, was known to have mysterious powers connections to the 72 most powerful demons...<br><br>Years have passed, and demons attack human kingdoms. A young warrior named Shellstein is told to learn the truth about the legacy of Solomon, which is the key to defeating the demons...<br><br>Wolfish Gallop: Legacy of the Solomon is a RPG with strong elements of a strategy game. The player is able to move on a linear world map, as well as visit towns and dungeon-like areas; player-controlled characters participate in turn-based combat against various enemies, in traditional Japanese RPG style. Like in strategy games, the player can control multiple parties of characters, which can form army units. Different characters take the role of main heroes during the game (Chapter One begins with the king Duran seeking help against demonic invaders), and, beside &quot;important&quot; story-related characters, simple soldiers can also be recruited and participate in battles.

Description=God has created a paradise called Wandante. Men, women, and animals lived together in peace. But where there is God, there is also Devil; where there is love, there is also hatred. The hatred between men and women grew, until it resulted in a bloody war. Having superior physical strength, men were victorious for a while - until female demons offered their help to women's army. Men's army was nearly destroyed. It was at that time that the hero, named Leopard Chateau-Lyon, appeared in Wandante. He is the only hope of the men, the one who will have to defeat the demonic women and to bring peace to both genders.<br><br>Wonpara Wars is a strategy board game which is somewhat similar to chess, but with much simpler rules (and decidedly much simpler than the Japanese chess, shogi). Some pieces are identical to those of Western chess (bishop), or move similarly to Western chess pieces, but have different names ("magicians" who move similarly to rooks); "soldiers" can walk in all directions, including backwards. There are also treasure chess scattered around the board, which can be captured by both the player's and the enemy army.<br><br>The battles are dictated by the plot; there are cut scenes before and after each battle, and they take place in different locations. The enemy army has a "boss" piece, unique for each battle. The battle is won when one of the sides has captured enough enemy pieces. Whenever the player's piece captures an enemy piece, a hentai scene occurs, typically showing a girl taking off her battle clothes.

Description=The protagonist of the  first game, Leopard Chateau-Lyon, finds himself wandering in a forest, having no memory of his own past, except his name. He is captured by two female warriors and is brought to their queen. It appears that there are only women in this country; when the hero says he is a man, the queen rejoices, telling him about an ancient legend that prophesied the advent of a creature named man, who will save their country from the ruthless queen of the neighboring land. The hero has to prove himself worthy of his heroic status and to defeat the enemy forces that threaten the country.<br><br>Wonpara Wars II follows the same principle as its predecessor: defeat the enemy army in chess-like battles, watch the cut scene, advance to the next stage. The rules for the board game itself are more complex. There are new pieces, taken from Western chess (knight) as well as original ones (ninja). The rules differ from known chess variants in several ways (random treasure chests can change the movement rules of a piece; many types of pieces can move only forward, etc.). The pieces also differ by gender: knights look like men, bishops like women, etc. Each army has a "master" piece, which represents the hero and the enemy general, correspondingly.  Once a general is captured, the battle is won. There are also unique enemy pieces, one for each battle.<br><br>Like the first game, capturing an enemy piece is accompanied by hentai pictures. Since there are male and female pieces, different pictures are displayed depending on which player piece has performed the capture.

There is no party in the game: Astral has to face the enemies alone. The enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based. The game has scenes with nudity and sexual situations.

He is aided by the treacherous Necromancer, who turned the soldiers of Farland into monsters. Will Latok be able to defeat the evil once again?<br><br>Xak III: The Eternal Recurrence is an action RPG, similar in gameplay style to its  predecessors, but also incorporating some elements first introduced in  Tower of Gazel, such as the ability to jump and having companions (although this feature is much more limited here). Jumping ability is crucial in many cases, as there are obstacles that can only be avoided by jumping over them. Latok starts at level 50, but still can gain experience points and become stronger. A new (and very useful) feature is hit points restoration, which occurs when Latok is standing still. To counter that, enemies can re-spawn, which means that there aren't many completely safe areas in the game.

It differs from the main  Xak series in several gameplay-related aspects, even though graphically it is very similar to the previous Xak games. Most importantly, Tower of Gazzel is not an RPG: Latok begins the game with maximized parameters and can not become stronger. The combat is similar to other Xak games: Latok attacks enemies with a sword in real time, and receives damage when they touch him. Tower of Gazzel is much more oriented towards puzzle-solving than the previous games. The entire game takes place in the tower, which is a huge maze containing various obstacles that the player must find solutions for (locked doors, seemingly impassable areas, etc.). Latok can jump over some dangerous spots (such as poisonous puddles). An important gameplay element is Latok's companion. Each of the four available companions has a different ability: for example, Fray can cast spells, Pixie can handle certain mechanisms in the tower, etc. In order to solve many of the puzzles, it is necessary to bring the right companion to the spot and let her take care of the problem.

It is your task to defeat the villain and to discover the secret of Ys!<br><br>Ys is an action RPG with original combat: instead of pressing the "attack" button, you simply run into the enemies you encounter. You do more damage if you run into them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in Adol's death if the monster is stronger than him. You gain gold and experience points for defeating your foes; once you have gained enough experience, you level up and become stronger. You can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.

During a summer vacation Takuya discovers a strange orb in his father's room, along with a letter containing information about the existence of a parallel world. At first Takuya doesn't take it seriously, but soon he realizes that he possesses a device that allows him to travel to an alternate universe. Is his father alive, after all? If so, where is he? Meetings and conversations with many beautiful girls (including his stepmother Ayumi), as well as a suspenseful investigation await Takuya!<br><br>"Yu-No" is a Japanese adventure (still screens viewed from first-person perspective, a lot of dialogue) with a unique feature: multiple paths, which are present in many Japanese bishoujo games, are shown on a special map and can be accessed within the same playing session, by using orbs like the one you found in your home in the beginning. If a path leads you to a dead end, you can use a stone, go back, and investigate another place to lead the story into a different direction. The interaction with the game world is not done through menu commands (except in the prologue), but through point-and-click interface.<br><br>"Yu-No" was originally a full-fledged hentai game (it was released for PC-98) with explicit sex scenes. The Saturn version still contains erotic images, but the hentai content was reduced.

Description=The third entry in the  Zan series retains the basic gameplay elements from the previous titles. Like  Kagerou no Toki, it is set in the  Sengoku period of the Japanese history - more precisely, in 16th century, the time of great turmoils and consolidation of the power, before the Tokugawa family became the sole ruler of Japan for two hundred years.<br><br>As in the previous game, the player chooses a leader of a small region in Japan, with the objective to rise to power and unite the country under his rule. Diplomacy is handled similarly, but the battles became more stream-lined, without the complex elements of the previous game. New to Zan III is the possibility to create a new general. The game offers a small face editor, and the player can choose not only geographical region, but name, age, and other characteristics of the playable leader.

Description=Kagero no Toki follows  Yasha Enbukyoku as the next game in the  Zan series. <br><br>Unlike the previous game, Kagero no Toki contains no supernatural forces (demons), and instead focuses on concrete events of the Sengoku period in Japan, more exactly 16th century, a period of Japanese history that was marked by continuous wars and famous leaders such as Oda Nobunaga or Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br><br>The game offers more strategic possibilities than the previous installments of the series. Choosing a region of Japan and its leader, the player can perform a variety of activities, both in his country and towards other leaders. Diplomacy includes negotiation, signing contracts and peace treaties, etc. <br><br>Battles are also more in-depth than before; instead of semi-automatic encounters battles occur on a separate map, on which the player has to actively navigate his unit, before he engages the enemy in close combat.

Description=Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game set in feudal Japan.<br><br>The background for the game's events is the ongoing battle between noble warriors, known as yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the "middle people", i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either yasha, demonic, or "middle" army. <br><br>The player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.

Description=Described by its developers as a "New Type Role-Playing Game", Zavas differs from the Japanese-made RPGs by resembling a Western-style RPG, in particular the  Ultima games of its time. Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana (with slight Middle Eastern influences), and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.  Similarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party (NPCs with names and portraits, but little personality can be found and recruited). beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices (for example, paying money or attacking a guard who demands toll to enter a city). The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.

Description=Zork: The Great Underground Empire is a classic text adventure game.  The player begins as an "adventurer" standing near a white house in a nice forest, but soon descends into the Great Underground Empire, where most of the game takes place. The player's quest is to collect the Nineteen Treasures of Zork. <br><br>As was typical for adventure games of its era, Zork does not use graphics. Instead, it communicates with the player via text, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands, such as "examine mailbox" or "take torch". For movement, the player types in geographical directions (such as "north" or "east" - or just "n" and "e"), and can check what items are being carried with the "inventory" command (or just "i"). <br><br>Zork was ported over from mainframes in the late 1970s. It is one of the first "text adventures" and is widely considered to be one of the great classics of the genre which reached the peak of its popularity in the '80s.
