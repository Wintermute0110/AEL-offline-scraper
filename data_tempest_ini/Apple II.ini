Description=Based on the board game of the same name, 221 B Baker St. pits up to four players against each other in a race to solve mysteries set in Victorian London.  After picking a character (Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, or Inspector Lestrade), players select one of the thirty available mysteries and read its case file in the game's manual.  The case file presents the particulars of the case, mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game.<br><br>Solving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together.  Among the fifteen locations available are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis.  Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful.  <br><br>Before solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge.  Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith.  Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and answer a quiz.  If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.

Description=Metropolis. Founded in 2213 A.D. by the United Stellar Council as the capital city of the planet XK-120, a mining planet and center of learning throughout the galaxy. That was the past. In 2315 A.D., Metropolis is invaded by the Tzorg. The new conquerer leave the planet but install a Robot Patrol System to keep the locals in check. Now the only resistance against the Tzorg occupation is a small group of resistance fighters of the Underground network. <br><br>Now in the year 2400 A.D. the final hope to overthrow Tzorg rule over the city is to infiltrate the Tzorg Authority Complex through a recently discovered secret route, access the terminals, and shut down the robots. That is if they had a computer specialist...<br><br>That's where you come in. As part of yet another shipment of miners from other conquered Tzorg lands to replace the 'disappearances' of past workers, you have been contacted by the Underground to join their struggle against the Tzorg. The contact leaves instructions for you. Find Spider, contact the Underground, goodbye and good luck.<br><br>In 2400 A.D., the player takes on the role of a soon-to-be member of the Underground resistance movement. The viewpoint is in 3rd person, where the player can see the 2D character from a top-down perspective, as well as other non-player characters and robots in the immediate surrounding vicinity, all of which move in real-time. The player may move up (N), down (S), left (W), right (E), as well as climbing up and down ladders. Although in real-time, the game is temporary paused when the player chooses a particular action, such attacking in particular direction.<br><br>Registration<br>No, the player does not have to register the game, however the character in the game does. The conquered city of Metropolis requires all individuals to register themselves at the registration office. This process must then be repeated at an appointed time (per 2,000 turns), similar to that of an ex-convict on parole. Failing to re-register will set all robots in the vicinity to attack the character, which will result in the character being jailed and all items confiscated at the Rehabilitation Center (there is no permanent death in the game). The player may also opt to "surrender" at anytime (which also results jail time at the Rehabilitation Center), in case the player finds oneself stuck in an area to avoid deadlocks.<br><br>Metropolis Life<br>The city of Metropolis is divided into 5 areas: Center, North, South, East, West. All of which are indicated by borders, guarded and patrol by different kinds of robots. Non-player characters (NPCs) also frequent the city. Although the player can talk to all NPCs, many 'important' NPCs will open dialog boxes, where the player must type in keywords for further information.<br><br>Exploration and transportation may be conducted via 3 approaches: Manual transportation (i.e. walking), using the Slidewalk (automated sidewalk/escalator), or by using subway system. The city contains a few merchants where the player may purchase some items. More curious items such as weapons and personal devices however, are rumored to be sold by the Underground. <br><br>Throughout the city, there are also power nodes, which allow the player to recharge weapons and other devices. Use of these power nodes are illegal by the Tzorg Authority, prompting a possible robot dispatch to the area, or if any robots are in the immediate vicinity, to attack the character.<br><br>Role-Playing and Combat<br>As a role-playing game (RPG), the character has 4 primary attributes: Energy (read=Health Points+Strength), Dexterity, IQ, Affinity. During character creation, the player may allocate 99 points among these attributes. These attributes will increase automatically during gameplay when the character performs certain actions. Affinity for example, may increase when the character talks to NPCs.<br><br>Combat initiates when the player attacks or is attacked by an enemy robot. Before combat however, the player must first equip a ranged weapon in the inventory (a maximum of 8 items) and recharge the weapon. The character cannot attack if no charged weapon is equipped (no melee combat). The player may only shoot in a diagonal or vertical direction, while robots have the advantage to attack in all 9 directions. If the character is hit, all attributes will be decreased. The attributes will over time return to their original scores.<br><br>If the player succeeds in defeating a robot, the player may search the remains and obtain money. Defeat, as mentioned before, will result in imprisonment and confiscation of items at the Rehabilitation Center. Robots will re-spawn after a certain amount of time.

(Unfortunately, you'll have to take our word for it, as the game doesn't make much use of these qualities.)<br><br>As in the wacky movie, your goal here is ultimately to overcome a potentially planet-destroying bomb set by the Black Lectroids, inhabitants of Planet 10.  Unlike the movie, you don't accomplish this by overcoming the Red Lectroids from the 8th Dimension with the assistance of Team Banzai and the Blue Blaze Irregulars  -- instead you wander an eerily depopulated town to procure the necessary components (gasoline, sand, bauxite and "a special catalyst") to power up your oscillation overthruster-sporting jet-car and transmit cancellation codes to the bomb. The game uses a simple VERB NOUN text parser and, on some platforms, illustrates the scene with static images.

The human player decides on the rules of the game first (i.e. four in a row horizontally wins) and then the A.I. “learns” the rules by playing the game and asking questions such as “have I won with this move?”.  Advanced players can then examine the routines that the AI used to study the rules and program in their own instructions for evaluating games.  Although the package overplays the “intelligence” of the Apple II slightly, A.I. was still  a surprisingly sophisticated set of learning algorithms for 1987.

However, whereas that game had more of a focus on role playing, Alice has more of a focus on puzzle solving.<br><br>Puzzles come in a variety of forms including many inventory based puzzles, and more appropriately, given the subject matter, riddles.  Also, there are many physical puzzles primarily taking the form of how to get from here to there through jumping and using inventory items to change Alice's size.  <br><br>The plot is more inspired by the Alice books than strictly adapting them.  Especially the game tries to adapt Carrol's sense of humor in its rhymes and puns. Interestingly, Alice's end of conversations are driven by selecting emotions rather than typing words, and it is possible to anger NPCs and have them stalk off, leaving you to wait until a preappointed hour when they will reappear.  The time can be discovered by looking at one of the various clocks throughout the game.

Description=Ancient Art of War is a real-time strategy game based on the very basic elements of war: unit types, formation, and strength. The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast "Barbarians", the heavily armored but slow "Knights", and the ranged "Archers". A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: "Spies", which is only available under certain campaign rule settings.  <br><br>The game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.<br><br>Gameplay is represented in two major areas:<br><br>1. The first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier;<br><br>The second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).<br><br>The difficulty setting is based on real-historical characters, (with the exception of possibly) Crazy Ivan as the easiest and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.<br><br>Construction Set<br>The game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.<br><br>EGA/VGA Version<br>Brøderbund released an EGA/VGA version of the game in 1989, using the same game engine and scenarios of the original CGA game. Campaigns made with the construction set of the CGA version were also playable with the EGA/VGA version.

Description=Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. <br><br>However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star Control, also by Paul Reiche III). If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.<br><br>Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.<br><br>The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.<br><br>Archon can be played with either one or two players.<br>The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.

It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.<br><br>The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.<br><br>By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Description=Battles of Napoleon is a historical wargame that lets you play either side in four of Napoleon's famous battles -- Auerstadt, Borodino, Quatre Bras, and the infamous Waterloo. Additionally, the game features a detailed scenario construction set that will allow you to design your own battles; everything from maps, to troop types, to weapon ranges and damage.<br><br>Gameplay is turn-based, each turn consisting of different phases. During your turn, you can establish various objectives (map squares to occupy) for each unit or commander, move commanders between units, move a unit, change formation, and, of course, attack or retreat. The Borodino scenario is the smallest, and can be used as a &quot;tutorial&quot; of sorts before moving on to the larger, more complex scenarios. This is a game that fans can legitimately spend several hours on.<br><br>The construction set allows, as you might expect, the creation of new scenarios for the game. In it, you will find the standard map and unit editors -- however, SSI allows you to make changes down to the weapon and unit type. This allows you to create scenarios for virtually any type of battle you can think of. As a silly example, it is possible to take the stock weapon &quot;musket&quot;, change the damage and range, and rename it &quot;laser rifle&quot; -- you then have the makings of a futuristic battle on your hands. (Of course, you would need to modify just about everything else to complete such a scenario... but you get the idea.)<br><br>The learning curve for this game is steep; it is probably not for the faint of heart. Anyone who enjoys getting shoulder-deep into battlefield strategy and tactics, though, will feel very comfortable with this game.

Description=Based on the Disney movie of the same name, The Black Cauldron focuses on the story of Taran, who is an assistant Pig-keeper in the land of Caer Dalben. One day Taran notices that one of his pigs, Hen Wen has magical powers. The Evil Horned King wants the pig so that he can locate the Black Cauldron and ultimately rule the world. Taran must now embark on a mission to rescue Hen Wen and defeat the Evil Horned King before his can discover the Cauldron's location.<br><br>The Black Cauldron is a side-view adventure game. Gameplay is similar to other Sierra adventure games of its day (such as Space Quest II or King's Quest III) but does not use a text parser. Instead the function keys are used to initiate actions. Players control Taran and can make him walk, run, swim and interact (talk) with other characters in the game. Puzzle-solving and advancement in the plot requires item manipulation of using the right item at the right time or at the right location.

In these countries, where all strangers are suspect and all actions observed, paranoia and vulnerability are inescapable. In these countries, innocent travelers get caught in the web of international espionage. This is the setting for Border Zone. Border Zone consists of three chapters. In each chapter, you play a different character (an American businessman, a Western spy, and an Eastern spy) involved in unique puzzles and goals. The chapters take place at different times and at different locations; as a player, you will get the most satisfaction if you play the chapters in order. Border Zone has a built-in clock which drives the story forward. Unlike other Infocom stories, the clock in Border Zone continues to tick even while you stop to think. So if you find yourself in a dangerous situation, you can't just sit back and relax. Whether you type in a command or not, characters will move around, events will happen, and the story will proceed.

If you dispatch the ants, you get to fight the millipede, which advances row by row, not stopping for anything including the plants (or your spider). It also throws daggers from time to time as it advances. The third wave pits you against the deadly med flies, which dance in a line around the screen. If you don't shoot them fast enough, they start to break off from the group, dancing wildly and raining daggers down upon you. Finish this last wave and you get bonus points for the amount of fuel you have left and get treated to a small interlude where a chorus of bugs sings to you as a med fly pollinates a flower.<br><br>The second and third levels are similar to the first, except that they are tougher.

Description=The first real-time strategy game in history, Cytron Masters was the creation of legendary designer<br>Dan Bunten (later Danielle Bunten Berry). In this game, the contestants face off on a futuristic battlefield. The object is to destroy the opponent's command center. The game can be played with two players, or one player competing against the computer.<br><br>CYTRONS (short for CYbernetic elecTRONic units) come in five types:  Mines, Shooters, Bunkers, Commanders, and Missiles. Shooters are constantly scanning for enemy units in their three space range. They will fire at the closest target. The Commander unit can relay orders from you to all Cytrons within three spaces of its location. Missiles soar above the battlefield. When detonated over an appropriate target, Missiles can destroy up to four Cytrons at once.<br><br>The battlefield is a 2-D grid. One contestant starts on each side. The main features on either end of the field are the Command Centers. The goal of each manager is the destruction of the opponent's Command Center. The players can use energy to create more Cytron units during the battle. The battlefield has eight Power Centers, and by occupying a Power Center a player will accumulate more energy.<br><br>Ahead of its time in many ways, Cytron Masters used multi-thread software routines to enable all the units to move in real-time. It also included an interactive tutorial. Dan Bunten went on to expand his ideas from this game in his later work Modem Wars, published in 1988.

There is no army to defend the lands, but if a few hardy adventurers can find a magical staff in the castle of a long-dead mage named Grelminar, the gate can be closed and the invasion averted.<br><br>The player controls a party of four characters, each with some standard-issue attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Piety, Body Points and Magic Points. The game also features three of the usual character classes (fighters, mages and priests), and there are different spell lists for each of the spell-casting classes. Players can create their own characters or use the ones provided by the game; either way, progress is automatically saved from time to time (though there is a reset button which allows the player to start over from the beginning).<br><br>The game starts out in a town (which is portrayed simply by a text-based menu system) and then proceeds into a multi-level dungeon.  While exploring the dungeon, different areas of the screen display different information.  There is a first-person, ninety-degree-turning view, an automap and, in some areas, a textual description.  These are supplemented by random third-person, turn-based combat encounters which take place in the window that normally shows the 3-D dungeon view.  In typical role-playing style, combat yields rewards of gold and experience (and sometimes equipment), and characters gain in abilities as they increase in experience.

Description=Four adventurers are sent by the Western Council to defeat out Uukrul, a great evil that once defeated the Ancients, thought to be destroyed, to possible invasion to the Western Lands. The last party sent by the council was lead by Mara, and it has been 18 months since they have sent word. The council assumes the worst. Now these adventurers must infiltrate the underground city of Eriosthe, and continue to the eastern end of Eriosthe, the heart of Uukrul's stronghold and destroy the evil once and for all.<br><br>The Dark Heart of Uukrul is a 1st Person Perspective, turned-based RPG, where the player takes control of a party of four specifically classed adventurers: a Fighter, a Paladin, a Priest, and a Magician. The player may use a pre-generated party or create an entirely new party. <br><br>The adventure takes place in the immense underground city of Eriosthe, which consists of twisting caverns and dangerous monsters. Adventurers may however, take refuge in Sanctuaries - safe havens created by the Ancients to provide safe resting, storing items, and access to teleportation portals. Characters sufficiently experienced will automatically be leveled-up here. Sanctuaries also act as a "progress indicator" as areas accessed after each sanctuary introduce stronger monsters and tougher puzzles. These safe havens may only be accessed after answering the puzzle by consulting the Soul Amulets (read=copy protection).<br><br>Aside from Sanctuaries, the only other gathering place for adventurers is the Marketplace. The marketplace is the only area in the whole of Eriosthe which provides services such as a Shop to purchase and sell weapons, items and food, a Forge to repair weapons, a Hospice to heal wounds and cure diseases, a Mausoleum where your dead can resurrected or laid to rest (removing dead members), a Guild to meet and replace (if needed) dead companions with new recruits and a teleportation portal, which links to other portals (such as those in Sanctuaries) and other areas. The Marketplace also links to Temples and the Magic Circle, which allows your Priest and Magician to advance (by obtaining rings of power). There are also rumors that a sage provides services in identifying objects somewhere deeper in the Eastern tunnels...<br><br>Adventuring in Eriosthe consists of exploring its caverns and defeating randomly encountered (or pre-set) monsters. An auto-map feature is also available, as well as a directional compass to help you guide your way. Certain encounters, such as puzzles may prompt the player to choose various options in handling the situation, each choice with a possible different outcome.<br><br>Turn-based combat occurs automatically when the party meets opponents while adventuring (indicated by a sudden picture of the opponent). Fighters and Paladins take the offensive role, while Priests and Magicians (usually) take the support role of casting spells, summoning elementals, and invoking the gods. Surviving combat may uncover money and items. <br><br>The Dark Heart of Uukrul has no sound or music.

They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.<br><br>Scrooge’s office is your headquarters. Here you have three options – you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.<br><br>You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It’s these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There’s also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who’s winning between you and Glomgold.<br><br>You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill … Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.<br><br>Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles include falling rocks, the Beagle Boys dropping objects from above, mountain goats, Magica de Spell and more.<br><br>The jungle features Scrooges’ nephews again. Here you must use swinging vines, branches and even hippopotamus’ backs to get to the treasure. Sleeping pumas, snakes, macaws and monkeys hamper you progress.<br><br>Searching a cavern involves Scrooge, his nephews and niece, navigating a maze using the map at the bottom of the screen to get to the treasure whilst avoiding the yeti tracking them down.<br><br>Photography, with Webbigail, Scrooge’s niece, involves her taking snaps of rare animals in a forest. Some animals get you more money for your snaps than others.<br><br>Once the thirty day marker is reached, whoever has the most gold between Scrooge and Glomgold is the winner.

Description=Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.<br><br>Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.<br><br>Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.<br><br>Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.

Description=Released in 1978 for the Apple II, Dungeon Campaign is one of the earliest role-playing games for home computers, and in a way again, like Beneath Apple Manor of the same year, an obscure Rogue-like -- two years before Rogue actually coined the term. Dungeon Campaign is a basic fantasy dungeon crawl that doesn't even care about a background story -- enter dungeon, slay monsters, amass treasures, find exit. Not even a fabulous all-powerful item to be found here! Unusual is that you do not control a single character, but rather a fighting force of 25 men -- who, effectively, represent your "hit points".<br><br>The game starts out by generating the four random dungeon levels you'll be exploring. This takes a few minutes, but as the maps are shown on-screen while generated, you can try to memorize them.<br><br>After this "introductory cutscene" begins the game proper. In a classic top-down view, you guide your party (a red block) through the level's maze. All commands are entered by key presses, using "LRUD" for walking left, right, up or down which needs getting used to.<br><br>You'll soon encounter green blocks -- groups of werewolves, vampires, orcs, goblins, basilisks, giant spiders, gargoyles, trolls, griffons and whatnot. Walk onto them to pick a fight, walk the other way to try evade -- some monsters are slow an can be evaded, while others will catch you.<br><br>Combat is done in a basic manner: Dices are rolled for you and the opponent; depending on the result, your and the enemies' losses are computed; last man standing's the winner. An interesting twist is that the dice rolls are interactive: Random numbers scroll up the text window, with you pressing a key to stop them when you feel lucky.<br><br>After a successful fight, you can search to find and grab any treasure carried by the defeated enemy. Sometimes you'll find a magic carpet, with which you can fly, making you randomly fly about the current level -- great for exploring, and indispensable for reaching parts of the map that cannot be reached. (Yes, map-generation isn't so sophisticated ;)<br><br>After a certain time spent on a level, you'll wake a special monster (grey block) who'll begin to chase you. If he catches you, you'll lose one of your party. On earliers levels, this block represents a "man-eating dragon" who is quite easy to escape, deeper levels feature a giant snake chasing you in real-time, or a spectre who, not being restricted by walls, goes directly for you and is sure to get you after some time.<br><br>Other hazards found in the maze include pits, necromancers or pteridactyls (sic!) that transport you to other parts of the level, or even to other levels (the abundance of these makes this game somewhat similar to the "Snakes and Ladders" board game), or areas with poisoned gas that you'll have to leave quickly (in real-time, again). You get a warning if you're next to one of these danger, but not you're not told where exactly it is. You can try to jump over a square where you suspect some dangers -- this feature can also be used to move quickly, for example to escape enemy monsters.<br><br>The main goal, of course, is to find the stairs down to the fourth level and find the exit.

Description=Temple of Apshai is the first in Automated Simulations' Dunjonquest series of role-playing games series and one of the first computer role-playing games. <br><br>The game could be described as a graphical "roguelike", but actually it resembles the mainframe classic DND more, as you cannot see the whole level, but only your surroundings. Furthermore, the level maps are not randomized like in Rogue. Still, the gameplay has a lot in common with Rogue and other early dungeon crawls: A solo character explores a monster-infested, multi-level dungeon to grab some treasure, everything in top-down view.<br><br>The game starts at the Innkeeper by creating a new character (if you already played the game, you can use characters that you created). You get different stat values (in Dungeons & Dragons style) as well as an amount of money that you can spend on weapons, armor and other equipment. Alternatively, you can just enter the stats to "import" characters from other role-playing games. (This is also used as a primitive "save / load game" mechanism.)<br><br>After character generation, you enter the dungeons. On the left, the current room of the dungeon is displayed; the character status and other info are displayed on the right. One thing that sets Temple of Apshai apart from other rpg is that the manual contains detailed room descriptions for each room (that may contain hints about traps or treasures), to create atmosphere despite crude graphics.<br><br>You move about and perform actions like opening doors, firing arrows, examining walls for secret doors etc. by pressing key commands. Moving is also done without cursor keys: You turn your character into the direction you want to go and then move him forward by 1 to 9 steps, also selectable by single keystrokes. But take care of fatigue: If you keep running all the time, your fatigue rises, and if it reaches 100%, you cannot move or act for some time -- which can be deadly in the presence of, say, a Giant Bombardier Beetle.<br><br>Each room may contain treasures to pick up (sometimes just trash, sometimes gold, sometimes useful items), secret doors which lead to hidden parts of the dungeon and traps, which obviously should be avoided (you can try to search for them). Of course, you will also encounter monsters -- a variety of undead or giant insects -- which you have to fight using turn-based combat. Apart from the normal attack, there is also the thrust (which is more effective, but risky), and you can also fire arrows at distance or parry. To avoid a fight, you may also try to speak to them.<br><br>If you return to the Innkeeper, you gain experience, which increases your stats. Still, if you quit the game, the only way to save your character is to write down the stats on paper and re-entering them the next time you play.

Description=Eamon, (AKA The Wonderful World of Eamon) was one of the earliest role-playing games available for the Apple II. It was also perhaps the first ever adventure game construction set.  <br><br>The game was public domain, so it was mainly distributed in Apple user groups and by trading with friends. The main game consisted of the Eamon Master disk, which had the Main Hall and a short adventure called the Beginner's Cave.<br><br>You started the game in the Main Hall, where you created a new character or selected an old character.  Then you could buy weapons, spells, and armor and go on your adventure.  Weapons came in five different types: Axe, Bow, Mace, Spear, and Sword.  There were three types of armor: Leather, Chain, and Plate. There were several spells: Blast, a damage spell, Power, which had random effects, Heal, which healed you, and Speed, which increased your chance to hit.<br><br>Character development was fairly simple.  Your character started with random stats in three categories: Hardiness (how much you could carry and the amount of damage you could take), Agility (How good you were in combat) and Charisma (Affected the costs of items in the store and the friendliness of monsters).  You also had percentage ratings for each of the weapon types that determined, along with the armor penalty, whether you could hit or not.  These percentage ratings had a chance of going up every time you hit a monster with that type of weapon.<br><br>The game was almost entirely text-based. There were a few adventures that made use of graphics, but they were the exception rather than the rule.  You interacted with your environment using simple one or two-word adventure game commands such as ATTACK RAT, INVENTORY,  or NORTH.  There was no option to save your game in most of the adventures, so death was often quick, sudden, and final.  <br><br>Since Eamon was in the public domain, other people started writing their own adventures with the Eamon Dungeon Designer disk. You could make a good hack-and-slash adventure in an afternoon or two  or you could spend lots of time writing modifications and special effects into your game by adding to the main game program, which was written in Applesoft BASIC.  Over 240 adventures were written for the Eamon system, with themes running from fantasy to mystery to movie knock-offs (one of my favorites was the Quest for the Holy Grail).<br><br>The Eamon game was expanded over the years to include more sophisticated inventory management, shortened commands, and better monster handling.  A commercial version was sold for a while and an expanded and more sophisticated version of Eamon called Swordthrust was developed by Donald Brown, but it never enjoyed the success of it's predecessor.

Each entry in the series had about 30 pictures to color. <br><br>Pictures could be colored from a palette of 16 colors. A mix button would "mix" the current color with the 15 other colors... give a total of 256 colors. Choosing a color and clicking in the picture would do a color fill in the area clicked. This was the first "computer coloring book." The finished, or in progress, coloring was automatically saved to disk. When this program was developed "color fill" algorithms were excruciatingly slow, a special algorithm was created that performed a high speed color fill.<br><br>Pictures could be printed with, or without, a monthly calendar.<br><br>One of the first games to support the mouse and color printing.<br><br>"This Land Is Your Land" had 30 pictures from around the United States.

Your team consists of a Medic, a Field Assistant, a Radio Operator, and a Guard. After equipping your team with all the necessary supplies (don't forget the mosquito netting!) you travel to your base camp at the edge of the jungle where you will begin your journey.<br><br>You will quickly meet up with many of the hazards of the jungle as you explore, including hostile natives (hope your Guard is a good shot!), mosquitoes, disease, covered pits, wildlife, and more. Each of your team members has an "EL" rating which indicates how close he is to dying. Death comes quickly for new team members, but as your team gains experience by mapping more and more of the Amazon and Incan ruins, your EL rating goes up and your team members become quite a bit more effective at avoiding hazards. You also get an Efficiency Rating "ER" which is an overall score of your exploration completed and loot collected minus your money spent and the number of team members killed.<br><br>Once you have mapped a few sectors of jungle you will find some ruins with passages leading underground. Underground is a lot more hazardous than the jungle, as many of the pitfalls you encounter mean instant death if you don't have the proper equipment or your team was not alert. The natives are also a lot more numerous underground as well.  But don't worry, you can always replace members of your expedition. Besides, what does it matter if you lost your Field Assistant if the rest of your team is carrying out a bagful of gold and silver?

First came the Apple ][, with a very scaled down instrument panel on bottom and outside/radar view on top, then the TRS-80, with mere 128x48 monochrome graphics and thus numbers and bars replacing the panel.  <br><br>There was only one aircraft and one region: a 6x6 grid with "mountains".  The user could press "W" and "declare war", entering the WW1 "British Ace" game mode.  The objective was to shoot down enemy planes and bomb their base.<br><br>Both the Apple ][ and TRS-80 versions originally came on cassette tape.  The Apple ][ version was updated in 1981 with minor improvements.<br><br>Note that the first PC version, Microsoft Flight Simulator (v1.0), was released two years later and is more similar to the 8-bit versions of Flight Simulator II.

Description=If there were any doubt as to the quality of Flight Simulator II, it should be dispelled by the knowledge that SubLOGIC went to the FAA for approval of its use in flight training.  Whether or not they actually got the approval—remember this was 1984, and such application of personal computers was new ground—they attempted to create a realistic flight simulator.<br><br>This flight simulator simulates a real aircraft, the Piper PA-23-181 Archer II.  For those with the knowledge, it offers practice with the variables of flight, including the avionics. The Atari ST-release (1986), instead, simulates the Cessna 182 single engine propeller aircraft and the Gates Learjet 25G twin engine jet. <br><br>The simulator was considered to be a second generation product.  It had many more features than first generation flight simulators, and pilots were expected to pay attention to small details.  SubLOGIC encouraged the users of the game to go to flight stores and purchase flight-training manuals and aeronautical charts to help them understand the variables within the program.  The game was oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there were options for non pilots too: the company included an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode.  These modes did not require the same level of knowledge.<br><br>Flight Simulator II was also packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace.  In this game your plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen.  The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to help gameplay.

Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.<br><br>The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels.

Monsters carry arrows, and also "magic bolts."  The last are interesting, as they destroy treasure too, as well as the Gemstone Warrior, should he be too close to the explosion.  Magic items abound, and help the warrior make it through the caverns.  Some magic items are traps too; there is a healing potion bottle that is similar to a poison bottle.  Other magic items include effects to freeze opponents, turn the warrior invisible, hide him among monsters with an illusion, annihilate all opponents in the current cavern, and cure disease.

Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle.

Description=Golf's Best: St. Andrews - The Home of Golf is a golf simulation which allows you to experience the layout and character of one of the world's most famous courses, St. Andrews. Each hole is simulated exactly to scale. Undulations in the terrain, such as actual hills and valleys as found on the course as well as trees, bushes, water, sand and buildings are included. Wind also plays a part in the simulation. St. Andrews is a very windy course. <br><br>The game's display provides all the information required to make a great shot. Each hole provides an overhead and side view. Wind on the course is displayed by an arrow at the bottom of the screen which points in the direction in which the wind is blowing and that your ball will tend to blow. The larger the arrow, the harder the wind is blowing. It also shows you where the ball is, how far you are from the pin, what surface you are on and what stroke you are about to hit. <br><br>Up to 4 players can play at a time. Enter your name. Select what type of tees that you wish to play from, Medal or Championship. Once selected, they will remain the same throughout the entire round. Choose the starting hole. Pressing the Enter key without specifying the hole will start you on the first hole. You are allowed to carry 14 clubs. One must be a putter. The club selection screen also gives you the prevailing wind speed and direction. This allows you to choose the correct clubs for the conditions. After choosing your club (C), choose how hard to swing (F). Force of stroke depends on the club used. Irons and Woods choices are full, three-quarters, half or quarter swings. Wedges and putter, you enter the force as a number representing the number of feet. Your choices will be displayed. Specify what direction to hit the ball (D) and whether to hook or slice (S). Once your selections are completed, hit the "1" key to hit the ball.<br><br>Order of play is determined by honors, the player with the lowest score on the preceding hole plays first. If you select hole 19, you will enter the clubhouse and your round will be over. Display the Scorecard by hitting the "4" key. Have a good round.

Description=Datasoft's The Goonies is one of the most fondly-remembered games in the genre of platform action-adventure-puzzle games for which Datasoft was known (other games included Conan: Hall of Volta, Bruce Lee, and Zorro, all well-regarded classics).<br><br>The game is licensed from the internationally-beloved Steven Speilberg film of the same name, in which a motley crew of suburban kids in Astoria, Oregon, must save their homes from being foreclosed upon and find their salvation in a treasure map leading to an old pirate ship in a cavern.  However, they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are also on the trail of the treasure.<br><br>The game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which contains unique and creative puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards.  For example, in one screen one player must wind up and hold a winch that lifts a large stone so that the other player can pass it, run backward on a ball floating in deadly water, bypass a series of three water buckets going up and down that kill you if you do not time your passage underneath correctly, jump to the top of a rail, and slide across to grab the key to the door below -- and all this without getting hit by a wandering bat.<br><br>One of the characteristic elements of this series of games is that it was organized more like an arcade game than an adventure game; the game kept a score and a high score, you got a certain number of lives, which would be replenished at certain points or at certain score totals, and there was no save feature.  In other words, the game had to be played all in one sitting, near-perfectly, to see the ending.  As might be expected, not many people finished these games.  (However, nowadays with emulators and memory-state-saving features, this is no longer such a frustrating problem.)<br><br>The Goonies can be played single-player, with the joystick button used to switch between the two characters on-screen, or cooperatively, with each player controlling one of the characters.

You will also receive bonus points for each Mogwai returned to the cage. <br><br>On many of the levels there will be various types of food lying about the screen. If a Mogwai eats any food, it will turn into a gremlin. There may also be  puddles of water; if a Gremlin or Mogwai runs into the water, it will split into two.

Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.<br><br>In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers.

Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras.

Blindness is a fact of life for commanders, who have to wait for their men to call in with information.

The player will command some of the most famous battles in U.S. history, and will have to deal with the same lack of face-to-face contact that plagues every higher-level military leader.<br><br>In this game the player replays historical battles in the wars with Mexico, World War I, World War II and the Korean War.<br><br>Think for a moment about war from the perspective of the Marine.  Out in the field, their duty is to carry out orders to the best of their ability.

Unfortunately, it is a fact that there is a disconnect between soldiers in the field and the commanders in the command centers. Commanders don't have a personal connection to each person under them.  They rely on those underneath them to report in...<br><br>This game gives some insight to the problems of command.  There are hundreds of units to keep track of, and the player needs a way to keep them organized.  The units become symbols on a map-board.  Contact with the units is limited to the reports that they send back and the orders that the player sends out.  Once the orders are given, the situation is really out of your control.  Will they be able or willing to follow orders exactly?  What happens if they are interrupted by the enemy, by weather, by terrain.  Is the information on enemy movements accurate, or did the player just send a division (thousands of men) to their deaths?<br><br>Most soldiers and Marines have never had the opportunity to see just what goes on inside the command centers, where the orders that they must follow come from.  This game recreates the command center.

Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines.

You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.

You roll the dice trying not to roll a total that doesn't equal some of the remaining numbers on the board. For example if there are only three numbers left on the board it is probably a good idea to pass the dice since there are quite a few illegal rolls. For every Doubles you roll, you get an insurance marker which allows you to roll illegally without losing the game (but only once). You can take off 1,2,3 or 4 numbers from the board at one time.<br><br>Winning the competition, Bonus Round will be proposed to a player.

Description=The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.<br><br>Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of <br>isometric death await.<br><br>The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.<br><br>The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.

It did not feature tactical space battles, however.<br><br>The main game screen displayed a grid of dots, with star systems shown by a larger circle with a color representing the star's type. Stars could have zero, one, or two inhabitable planets. Warships could be custom designed and were tracked individually with a maximum of 255 war ships per player in existence at one time. Transports could carry either colonists and troops and traders carried metal or food surpluses to where they were needed. During an invasion, the respective armies from each player would fight until one force was destroyed. However, planets thus captured could suffer from guerrilla resistance for several turns and if not eradicated could overthrow the invaders or assist your opponent's armies in the event of a counter invasion.<br><br>Given the tiny systems it ran on, this game did a very good job of simulating many important considerations, and was the first introduction of some of the things that have become staples in 4X space games; most notably ship design and refits.

The host gathers a great amount of fictional facts and clues, and hands it to the players/actors in turns.

The winner is he who gets the most facts right, or, in case no one can guess right, the murderer wins.<br><br>The software is the ultimate tool for the murder party host. You simply input a large amount of data from the guests of your future party, and it automatically mixes their data with the story and generates a murder, motives and a large amount of clues, all to be printed into personal booklets for each player. It even generates the invitations to be mailed to the guests. It also provides a good share of hints on how to host a better murder party, with advice ranging from mood setting, music and costumes to even handing out recipes for three-course dinners. Once the booklets have been printed out, though, the computer is no longer necessary, and it's all up to the host and guests to make the party happen.<br><br>It features two built in scenarios, Empire and Big Kill, each with different stories, characters and settings.

Description=The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.<br><br>Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.

Description=Oil Barons is a turn based strategy game for one to eight players. The object of the game is to accumulate the most wealth by locating and drilling for oil. During the game you will need to survey different lands ranging from the arctic to the desert for oil potential, choose the best sites and drill! Congress may pass bills from time to time which forbid drilling in parks and other reserved lands, which may or may not affect a players strategy. Several modes of gameplay are featured, including  regular classic, reality mode (oil locations are more randomized at the beginning of the game, and costs are supposed to more closely resemble those in real life), and customized modes. Included with the game is a game board with a 50x40 grid of the landscapes you can drill in, and dozens of game pieces to keep track of which locations belong to a player and where oil has (or has not) been discovered. This makes Oil Barons resemble a board game, but with a computer to do the bookkeeping and add a random element instead of dice.

Description=Old Ironsides is a two player game that simulates nineteenth century naval combat. The action takes place on a single screen in which each player controls a three-masted sailing vessel. The speed and movement of the ships is determined by the wind. The wind is always blowing from south to north, making southward movement difficult unless a player tacks and navigates his ship in a zigzag manner.<br><br>Each ship is equipped with twelve cannons, six on each side of the ship, and a supply of powder. The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing player in battle. A player loses if either their ship is sunk or if they get lost in the fog.<br><br>Sinking a vessel can be achieved by cannon fire or by ramming. Cannons fire perpendicular to the direction of travel. As a ship takes damage, a status indicator will slowly fill with red and a ship will lose cannons, thereby decreasing their firepower. Occasionally, an especially accurate broadside will hit an opponents magazine, instantly destroying the adversary's ship. As players fire cannons, their powder supply will deplete. Powder regenerates itself at a rate much slower than the rate of fire, so players must always be aware of their stockpile.<br><br>If a ship moves off the edge of the screen, it is said to be, "in the fog." A ship that  stays in the fog too long loses the battle. A series of increasingly higher pitched beeps warn the player that their time is running out. Navigation in the fog is aided by a compass display at the top of the screen. This indicator shows the ship's bearing at any given time and can be switched off if a player wishes to hide their movements in the fog.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.<br><br>Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.<br><br>Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.<br><br>The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.<br><br>After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.<br><br>Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.

Description=From the Racter FAQ:<br>In 1984, William Chamberlain published a book called "The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed" (Warner Books, NY. 0-446-38051-2, paper $9.95). The introduction claims: "With the exception of this introduction, the writing in this book was all done by computer." <br><br>The authorship is attributed to RACTER, originally "written in compiled BASIC on a Z80 with 64k of RAM."Racter strings together words according to "syntax directives", and the illusion of coherence is increased by repeated re-use of text variables.  This gives the appearance that Racter can actually have a conversation with the user that makes some sense, unlike Eliza, which just spits back what you type at it.  Of course, such a program has not been written to perfection yet, but Racter comes somewhat close.  <br><br>Since some of the syntactical mistakes that Racter tends to make cannot be avoided, the decision was made to market the game in a humorous vein, which the marketing department at Mindscape dubbed "tongue-in-chip software" and "artificial insanity".

Description=Reach for the Stars is the original "spaceploitation" game.  The player has the opportunity to name his civilization and those of his (up to three) AI opponents before he begins his attempt at galactic domination.  The game is very bare bones by modern standards: the 2D galaxy map is marked only by planets and their names in few different colors.  Also, there is no diplomacy and no player control over tactical combat.<br><br>What remains is a hard-core game of grand strategic and economic production.  The player must tweak his planets, build ships, research new tech levels, and deploy fleets.  A nice feature of the game is that just about all of the underlying dynamics can be altered and customized by the player, which means that Reach for the Stars is infinitely replayable.

Description=Rings of Zilfin is an unusual, but relatively unknown early fantasy solo RPG by Ali N. Atabek, who went on to create the Magic Candle series. It was meant for beginners to computer RPGs, featuring no character creation, simple game play and movie-like cut scenes, concentrating more on atmosphere than on character stats.<br><br>The background: Long ago, the Zilfins (mighty wizards) established an enchanted realm of peace and property in Batiniq. They created two rings of power which, worn together, made the wearer invincible. Unfortunately, the evil necromancer Lord Dragos has found one of these rings and has come to great power. The only hope to prevent him finding the second one is Reis, a young boy possessing some innate magical ability. In the introduction, Reis barely escapes Dragos' minions, and leaves his home village. <br><br>After "character creation" (giving Reis an optional other name and selecting one of 10 difficulty levels, which affect your starting resources), you start your quest to find the Zilfins and their second ring and to develop your magical abilities on the way.<br><br>The game features a huge world with over 100 villages and towns in four kingdoms. Each town has up to three buildings you can enter -- shops with items to buy and sell, inns to eat and drink and rest, amongst others --, and also people you can talk to (careful, some are shape shifters!), sometimes offering valuable information. There are also a few dungeons and some caves to explore, but most of the game is played in towns or travelling between them.<br><br>When leaving a location, the game shows a map where you can select the direction off your next target. While travelling between locations, the game shows an interesting side scrolling view. You can set your walking speed, which influences your fatigue, and stop when you encounter pools or plants. Pools can be drunk from (may have positive or negative effects), and the plants can be gathered and eaten later. Some plants have special effects, there are "magic mushrooms" and some other healing and boosting plants. This plant system is one of the things that distinguishes this game.<br><br>While travelling, you may also encounter Lord Dragos' minions, which results in some pseudo-real time combat. The monsters are often quite unusual, like Barvils (mutated bats), Basurs (flying skulls) or Zumagin (the death ray demon). Protected by different armors, you can attack with arrows or swords or by casting spells. The game makes a difference between ground-based and air-bourne monsters -- the latter cannot be attacked with swords, of course.<br><br>The spell system is quite simple. There are three spell levels: Apprentice, Master and Grand Master, each one lets you know more and more powerful spells. Casting a spell always costs some fatigue, and you have to prepare the spell first.<br> <br>The game is highly non-linear and there are several approaches possible. For example, it is possible to make money by trading, buying cheap items in one town and selling them in another town -- which, in fact, is the only way to make money in the beginning. All commands are given by pressing keys, like "G" for getting things or "C" for casting spells. The game may be saved when exiting towns and loaded at the main menu.

Description=Rocky's Boots is a simple educational puzzle game where you can learn about logic circuits.<br><br>You control a nondescript square, moving it about several rooms. Each room contains basic electronic parts like AND, OR and NOT gates, flip-flops, delays and clocks. You can pick these up and combine them to build simple or complex circuits. <br><br>After a helpful tutorial, the task in the game is to build "kicking" machines: Objects of different colors move through an area and turn sensor outputs on and off. You now have to build a circuit that activates a kicking device which kicks the right objects out. When you do it just right, Rocky the raccoon dances a little jig to a joyful melody for you!<br><br>The game also features an editor where you can build you very own kicking puzzle.

Description=The player controls a gun turret at the bottom of the screen. The turret can swivel to cover a large area of the screen, but cannot move from its base. Helicopters fly across the screen at varying heights, dropping paratroopers. The gun may fire multiple shots at once, and the shots may destroy helicopters or shoot paratroopers. Paratroopers may be disintegrated by a direct hit, or their parachutes may be shot, in which case they will plummet to earth (splattering and dying if they were sufficiently high when the shot hit). Furthermore, destroyed helicopters turn into shrapnel, which may destroy other helicopters or paratroopers. Periodically, jets may fly by and drop bombs; the jets and bombs may be shot as well.<br><br>The player earns points by shooting helicopters, paratroopers, jets, and bombs. Firing a shell costs the player one point, so if one is playing for score, there is an incentive to conserve ammo.<br><br>The game ends when the player's turret is hit by a bomb, when a single paratrooper lands directly on the turret, or when four paratroopers safely land on either the left or right of the turret (that is four on one side, not four total). Once this happens, they are able to build a human pyramid and climb up to the turret and blow it up.

Description=An intermediary step in complexity between the brutally basic HAMURABI and more sophisticated modern titles such as Civilization, Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio ushers you into a Merchant Prince setting, governing over a 15th-century Italian city-state, competing with the savage forces of nature and against up to 5 (7 in some later versions) other players in the hot-seat, seeing who can rise through the ranks to claim titles from COUNT, to MARQUIS, GRAND DUKE (and, finally, H.R.H. KING.)<br><br>At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace.  However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger.<br><br>Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves.  Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies.  If, after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled!<br><br>Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death.  All the more reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you've got, while you've got it.

The chief does not move, instead remaining in a set position.<br><br>Along the way, he must avoid roaming guards, bouncing cannonballs, and other traps.  The crusader is armed with a bow and can pick up directionally specific arrows that are used to stop guards or destroy walls. The arrows being limited to shooting in one of the four compass directions is exacerbated by only being able to carry one object (key, arrow or bomb) at a time. For these reasons, the game's puzzle leanings and the need for a methodical approach are strong.<br><br>There is generally only one way to solve each level and proper use of the given tools is key to finding it.

At the beginning of each level, three enemy snakes will also enter the maze. To complete the level, you need to eat all of the enemy snakes. If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches! The maze changes for each level, and the enemy snakes progressively become larger and tougher to catch.

There are dozens of characters (including famous real-life figures such as escapist artist Houdini, Gertrude Stein, Sir Lawrence of Arabia, Picasso and Thomas Edison)<br> to observe, follow and spy on and determine who may be a suspect during the  time limited game. There are 6 smaller cases within the whole mystery which must be solved in order to arrive at the final truth.

In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.

Description=You are in command of Space Station Zulu and its 43 man crew orbiting a huge gaseous giant in a farflung corner of the galaxy. Shortly after an exploration ship leaves the station the onboard computer notifies you that the sanctity of the station has been violated by unknown alien lifeforms ( which find your crew very tasty). Now you must direct your crew in a desperate struggle against this deadly peril. There is only one way to win and that is to rid Space Station Zulu of all the alien intruders. The aliens win by taking over the ship. There are 3 levels of difficulty (normal, difficult, and little hope) and this is a one player versus the computer game.

Description=In Spare Change, you are the owner and operator of the Spare Change Arcade, dedicated to making your place of business run as smoothly as possible. Inside the arcade are Token machines, jukeboxes, telephones, movie booths, popcorn machines, and so on. The token machines need to be restocked with money from the cash register when they are out of tokens, but eventually, the register must be replenished with cash from the safe. You must drop the tokens in one of your two storage bins. When you have stored at least ten tokens, the movie booth opens, and you can go inside to proceed to the next level. You are also awarded one bag of money, but if you store more than ten tokens, then more than one bag of money is awarded for each extra token collected. If nine bags of money are obtained, you proceed to the next level.<br><br>But the Zerks, two aliens that run around the screen, can steal tokens either from the machines or from the storage bins. Sometimes, a Zerk will toss a token to the other nearest the "piggy bank". You must touch them in order to get the token back, before they throw it in their piggy bank.  Alternatively, you can throw a token into the jukebox, telephone, popcorn machine, etc. and the Zerks will get distracted from their goal, giving you enough time to continue filling the storage bins. If the Zerks insert five tokens in the piggy bank, the game is over.<br><br>Between levels, an intermission plays, which are similar to those in Pac-Man. Later in the game, you have the ability to access these intermissions. As you proceed through the levels, the game gets quite difficult.

Everything from your starship, the mainframe to torpedoes are all ASCII characters. <br><br>Gameplay<br>Gameplay consists of fulfilling the target number enemy kills mentioned in the mission briefing in a specified amount of time. Higher levels demands more kills and less time requirements. Gameplay consists of 2 major areas:<br><br>1. Main Computer and Navigation<br>Your starship is equipped with state of the art navigation equipment. The main screen displays your main visual display, consisting of the main star chart map, your current position and visual displays. Other sections/information of the starship maybe accessed through the appropriate buttons.<br><br>Navigation may be conducted automatically or manually. Standard navigation (automatically) is conducted by accessing the main computer and setting out a course. Higher levels may result on random events during navigation (such as electrical storms, running into asteroids or enemy ships). <br><br>Each map is randomly generated and also uncharted. Each quadrant is represented by numbers, where each number refers to: Stars, Starbases and number of enemy ships. Your starship is also equipped with long-ranged sensors to view adjacent quadrants an well as short-ranged sensors to view your current surroundings. For even further exploration, your starship also has probes to scan far-away quadrants. <br><br>Combat: Starships, Starbases, and Marines<br>Combat is the essence of gameplay in Star Fleet I: The War Begins. Entities in a combat situation may consist of the following: Your starship, enemy Krellan starships (max 5 per quadrant), enemy cloaked Zaldron starships (usually one per quadrant), allied Starbase  and Space Marines.<br><br>Combat initiates when your starship enters a hostile quadrant (portrayed by a red number on the main map), usually patrolled by a minimum of 1 (one) Krellan starship. Red Alert is automatically set (unless configured otherwise) resulting the rising of shields and direct attack by enemy starships. <br><br>Enemy starships are either Krellan starships or the Zaldron cloaked. Krellan starships fire only phasors to soften up your shields. Although your starship is greatly over-matched compared to a single Krellan starship, numerous enemy ships will prove very dangerous. Zaldron starships are unique as they have the ability to cloak (invisible on the both map screens). Zaldrons also use phasers as their main weapon.<br><br>This type of combat consists of either eliminating all hostiles in the present quadrant (by destroying the enemy ships) or by capturing those ships (and optionally delivering them to a starbase). Your main arsenal consist of Phaser, Torpedoes and Mines. Torpedoes are reserved for direct destruction of enemy vessels. Phasers are usually reserved for the intent of disabling an enemy vessel for capturing purposes. Mines are used to damage enemy vessels that have the bad habit of moving around when eluding your torpedoes.<br><br>Capturing enemy vessels may only be conducted when the enemy vessel is disabled (by phasers or other means). Space Marines then must board the adjacent ship and automatic combat occurs between your space marines and the enemy crew. If successful, the enemy ship will be captured as well as some power reserves and enemy prisoners. Be warned that enemy prisoners or enemy spies may board your ship without your knowing and damage your ships systems (indicated by "Intruder Alert"). The enemy ship may then be towed to be transported to a Starbase.<br><br>If enemies prove to much for you and your heavily damaged ship, you can opt for "Self-Destruction". Be warned, you will survive but it may hamper your mission score greatly.<br><br>Unique combat situations refer to "Starbase Under Attack" where an allied Starbase is under attack by enemy starships, requiring your immediate attention for rescue.<br><br>After successfully completing a mission, your mission success is rated: Number of enemies destroyed, captured, starbases rescued, etc. You will then be considered for a promotion or a commendation for a medal!

Interstellar travel was nonexistent, and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union. You are a native of the planet Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near destruction. As a result of your heroics, you were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning groth cages! Finally, your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as those brochures had promised! Oh, how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious scrubwork with tedious paperwork. Since your planetfall on Resida, five long years have dragged by, without a single event worthy of note. Why, just look at today's "thrilling" assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick up a supply of Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms...

Description=Gir Draxon, Supreme Overlord of the Arcturan Empire has declared war on the Terran Federation. The leaders of Earth respond by sending the Terran Fleet on their way to Arcturus to intercept Draxon's armada. But this was a deadly mistake: the Arcturans have discovered warplinks, which allow them to transport troops from one link to another instantaneously, even across vast interstellar distances. With the fleet halfway across the galaxy, the enemy has already reached the Sol system and occupied Saturn's moon Titan. Now, humanity's only hope is the experimental Raven armored vehicle. One courageous pilot must take the Raven through seven different star systems, from Titan to Arcturus, defeating any and all Arcturans, using the warplinks to travel from one system to the next.<br><br>Stellar 7 is a first-person action game inspired by Atari's Battlezone, with similar wireframe graphics. In each of the seven levels, the player must defeat a number of enemies. Doing so reveals the warplink that takes the Raven to the next system. <br><br>Next to a cannon, the Raven is equipped with radar, shields, and a cloaking device. The cloak drains the energy level of the vehicle substantially, and the depletion of the energy reserves or the shields destroys the Raven. Some of the levels include fuel bays that allow the player to recharge the energy.<br><br>Various enemies await on the different worlds. These include both ground vehicles (sleds, tanks, hovercraft) and aircraft as well as stationary laser turrets, homing bombs, robot drones and more. All enemies vary in firepower, speed and armor ratings. An in-game mission briefing introduces most adversaries, but some special ones come as surprises.

Description=SwordThrust is a commercialized and enhanced version of the Eamon RPG. Your hero begins in the land of Diurla at the Main Hall, where he (or she) must register, roll up stats, equip, and buy spells before going on one of many adventures.  <br><br>Like in its predecessor, your main stats are Hardiness (the number of hits you can take before you die and your carrying capacity), Agility (affects your chance to hit monsters), and Charisma (affects prices at the Main Hall and the friendliness of monsters). SwordThrust also adds  another ability called Left Hand, which affects your chance of hitting with weapons in your left hand. All the standard weapon categories (Axe, Bow, Club, Spear, Sword) are inherited from Eamon and work in similar ways. Your weapon score is a percentage chance for you to hit with that type of weapon, and it has a small chance of going up each time you hit. <br><br>SwordThrust adds many new spells to the standard Eamon spellbook of Blast, Power, Heal, and Speed.  Some examples of the new spells are: Charm (makes monsters friendlier towards you), Fear (makes monsters run away), Thickskin (increases your armor), This greatly expands your options in the game as well as giving you something to spend your extra gold on since the most powerful spells can cost 30000 or more gold pieces.<br><br>Adventuring is very similar to Eamon. The dungeons are all text-based, similar to an adventure game. You move and fight through the dungeons with commands like NORTH, INVENTORY, ATTACK RAT, and so on.  Some improvements over the Eamon interface are that the room description and character status are displayed in a window at the top of the screen so you don't have to constantly be LOOKing to figure out where you are. Another gameplay change is that your character can get fatigued.  When your fatigue gets too high, you pass out which may end up killing you if monsters find you. Stopping and RESTing is necessary, but it is easy to get very fatigued in a difficult battle and pass out when you have to run away to rest.<br><br>Equipping items is also much different than in Eamon. You can now equip weapons in your left hand if you don't use a shield, potentially doubling your number of attacks. Armor is also now equippable, so it is possible to find better armor during your adventures instead of being stuck with what you bought at the Main Hall. <br><br>SwordThrust had several adventures written for it, including The King's Testing Ground, a beginner's adventure that came with the game.   Other adventures included:<br><br>1. The Vampyre Caves<br>2. The Kidnappers Cove<br>3. The Case of the Sultan's Pearl<br>4. The Green Plague<br>5. The Eternal Curse, and<br>6. The Hall of Alchemie

Description=Loosely based on Clavell's Taipan, this game is a trading simulation set in the Far East during the 1800s. The player is based out of Hong Kong and has a single trading ship with which he can transport one of four cargoes from place to place. There are different cargoes to be traded, from the cheaper general goods to the more expensive arms and silks, culminating in the opportunity to trade in the illegal opium trade.<br><br>     Generally, the strategy here was buy low, sell high. To add some tension to the game, there is a random chance that you will encounter several obstacles to your trading empire. Random pirates, pickpockets, and thieves who rob you and your warehouse are all out there for their own benefit (and your detriment!) Li Yuen acts as the local mafia boss, extorting increasing sums of money for his "protection". Local authorities will seize your opium and fine you if you're caught, ruining an otherwise successful voyage. Local market conditions can render a price extremely high or low, giving you a chance to make a quick buck.<br><br>     You have the option to trade up to a larger ship as time goes buy, as well as outfit your current ship with guns. However, beware! The larger the ship, the more pirate ships it attracts! Also, the larger ships are more expensive to repair. <br><br>     You can play as long as you want--you're given the opportunity to retire once you reach one million. You're given a score at the end of the game based on your net worth, your ship size, and a few other factors.     <br><br>     All in all, this is a pretty decent trading simulation, even if the monochrome graphics left something to be desired. Although some parents may want to avoid a game with opium in it, overall it's great for teaching basic economic concepts to kids.

Description=Trains is a top-down managerial game. In the age of steam powered trains, there are opportunities to make money on great railroads. It will be up to the player to take control of a train on a railroad and turn a profit. The player does this by moving the train to a loading station that will supply raw material, and stopping in front of it with the appropriate car and blowing the whistle to begin the loading process. This is then delivered to the stations of industries that need them, unloading taking place the exact same way. The faster goods are delivered, the more money is made, with extra profits available when an industry is in critical need of a supply. Meters of available industry supplies can be shown on the screen. The train itself can only be stopped and move forwards and backwards, following the path of the train track, left and right movement is used only at switches, where the track splits into two directions. Each action of train movement uses coal, multiplied by the weight of the goods being carried. Coal is resupplied at the coal yard, and is loaded into the coal car the same way as other goods, spending money in order to buy coal. If the player runs out of coal while driving the train, it will cost them twice as much to have the coal delivered to the train. Every 3 minutes, $200 is deducted from the player for payroll and any crashed train costs another $200 in penalties. Each level is a unique track design, and can take place across cities, deserts, mountains and plains. As industry supplies are managed, a track is gradually built at the edge of the screen which will lead to the next level.

Description=Typhoon of Steel is a tactical level simulation of small unit actions during WWII. It is a sequel to the best selling Panzer Strike and the rules are very similar. Three theaters are covered: the Pacific Theater (Americans vs Japanese), the Asian Theater (British vs Japanese) and European Theater action involving American vs German troops. <br><br>Typhoon of Steel includes practically every ground weapon used by the combatants in this theater (over 220 weapon types). Units consist of infantry squads or single guns and tanks. You can choose to simulate either single battles or entire campaigns spanning several years. In the single battles you can play against another person but in campaigns you play against the computer. <br><br>The ultimate objective of the campaign games is to fight and win as many battles as possible before the war ends. If you suffer heavy losses during one battle it will take a long time to replace and upgrade your forces before you can fight the next battle. Single scenarios can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours with campaigns lasting up to 30 hours. Like Panzer Strike, the gameplay is considered to be advanced level.

Other than that the gameplay is pretty much the same as in Ultima I, with your single character roaming the land fighting monsters and looking for key items.<br><br>In the original Ultima a hero from a certain third rate blue planet orbiting an insignificant yellow sun came to the world of Sosaria and slew the evil wizard Mondain before he could fulfill his dreams of universal domination. Thus peace was brought to Sosaria, and the hero hailed as a champion of the people of all time. <br><br>Unfortunately, Mondain happened to have a young apprentice/lover named Minax who is understandably upset over his death. Using her considerable powers, Minax travels through time and space to the hero's homeworld of Earth and instigates a nuclear war, thus serving the dual purpose of working out her frustration as well as erasing the hero from history. Of course, as the hero, this works out rather badly for you, and so with the help of Lord British you must travel through time and somehow find Minax and prevent the events which culminate in the destruction of Earth.

Description=The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. <br><br>Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.<br><br>This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. <br><br>Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

Description=OVERVIEW<br><br>Omnitrend's Universe is an incredibly detailed and complex science fiction role-playing game strongly reminiscent of the original Traveller hard science fiction pen-and-paper role-playing game, the likes of which have not been seen since.  It is based in the same fictional universe as Omnitrend's well-regarded Rules of Engagement (1991-93) and Breach (1987-95) series, and was the basis for two sequels, Universe II (1987) and Universe 3 (1989).<br><br>Running in the same vein as games like Elite (1985), Starflight (1989) and SunDog: Frozen Legacy (1984) (as well as more modern ones like the X: Beyond the Frontier series (1999-2005)), its gameplay involves freelance space exploration, trading, space combat, planetary mining, and other economic activities.  However, where its similarly-themed contemporaries focused on graphical interfaces and, to varying degrees, action, Universe was sparing with graphics and left more to the imagination, instead focusing on deep gameplay, strategic elements, and sophisticated modeling.  Indeed, at least half of gameplay is conducted via textual menus.<br><br>THE STORYLINE<br><br>In Universe, you are a new independent starship captain in the Local Group, a cluster of stars colonized by Earth in the relatively near future.  Mankind has had the hyperdrive for almost four hundred years, but hyperdrives have ship size and range limitations that effectively prevented exploration and colonization beyond a 40-light-year radius.  However, in distant orbit around Tau Ceti, an exploration ship found an enormous alien artifact called the hyperspace booster, which allowed one-way travel at a distance of thousands, rather than tens, of light years.  The discovery of the hyperspace booster allowed a great Second Interstellar Expansion, and Axia, a star system specially noted in the hyperspace booster's starmaps, was colonized.  The Local Group is the cluster of stars surrounding Axia.<br><br>For over two hundred years, Axia has received regular packages from earth via the hyperspace booster, but the packages mysteriously ceased arriving four months ago.  The Local Group, considerably behind Earth technologically, is dependent upon the packages and has its own political and economic problems, so this is a grave problem.  Panic is spreading as rumors fly about what happened to earth.<br><br>Recently, Axian Central Educational Institute announced that there is evidence of a second hyperspace booster in the Local Group.  You, with your new ship and your enormous new debt, are one of those who hope to find the hyperspace booster and collect on the large reward for it.  However, operating a starship is expensive, and you will receive no funding.  Thus, you must make your own way however you see fit.<br><br>THE GAMEPLAY<br><br>When you begin the game, you must choose the terms of your 300,000-credit mortgage and select a starship hull from various models that differ in size, layout, visibility to other ships (and therefore the likelihood of receiving undesirable attention) and sturdiness.  Then, after a copious bit of disk-swapping, you proceed to drydock, where you can equip your ship and place all your ship's parts (hyperdrive, bridge, crew quarters, weapons, shuttles, cryogenic storage, et cetera) in its different sections (each of which has differing capacity and visibility -- this matters when a hostile starship hits you and the game must determine where you got hit and what got damaged).<br><br>From there, the Local Group is wide open.  Trading, passenger transport, ore mining, smuggling, contract cargo transport, and even piracy (or pirate-hunting) are all lucrative options, and gameplay for all of these is deep and has a Traveller-esque feeling to it.<br><br>As is oft-said, the game is complex.  Of course, there is the much-cited fact that you must plot your own orbits, calculating the minimum safe orbit (planetary diameter plus five percent) yourself to avoid wasting energy in long and inefficient transits to the planet's surface.  This is less difficult than it sounds in the game, but does take some thought.<br><br>Beyond that, a good example of Universe's gameplay is how planetary surface mining is handled.  To go into mining, you must first equip your ship with ore processors, and, if you want to mine low-tech populated planets, assault capsules.  You must also hire sufficient crew to run them all.  Then, you must find a planet rich in resources and go into a low orbit around it; start the computer's Resource and Amphib Assault software packages (which may necessitate turning off Hyper Navigation or Sub-C Navigation to make space); convert Ore IV to energy to charge up the assault capsules; and launch them.  When you have done this, an abstract isometric grid representing the landscape is displayed, with each assault capsule is shown with a vertical line extending from it to the landscape representing its altitude (see the screenshots).  Here, you give them orders as they go down to the planetary surface to secure the area, being careful to scan the landing surface repeatedly to ensure it will support the ore processors (the scanners aren't 100% accurate, and you don't want your landers to sink into a swamp, fall into a thermal vent or tip over on jagged landscape).  Combat is conducted abstractly, in a manner vaguely similar to a strategic board game.  If you win this fight and secure the landing sites, you then charge up, crew and launch the ore processors.  Once they land (assuming they landed safely), choose which type of ore each one mines, and then let 'em rip until they run low on energy or until they are too damaged to continue, at which time you launch them and they return to the ship with their valuable cargo.  If you've done well, you've got a substantial load of precious ore you can sell at the next starport.<br><br>Finally, Universe is noteworthy for its rich texture, which can be seen in the way the game designers handled trade commodities and the different brands of ship parts you can purchase.  You can buy and sell cargoes of such exotic goods as Ghan Eggs (very tasty, don't you know), KCLA Lambate, Instashelters, Replent 433-435, Arbist PECIL, and the exotic and mysterious Pupbapy.  Indeed, throughout the game, all items are named as they normally would be in a commercial context.  When you buy shipboard weaponry, you can choose from such items as the Franklin IV laser, the Sunstorm laser, or even a Giaparelli missile launcher.  When you upgrade your starship's hard drive (an irony given the game's frequent disk-swapping), you'll sell off your Skandis and purchase a Datar, which can run more operational software simultaneously and require less software swapping, which you must do manually (more irony).

Description=This is the sequel to the first part of the Warriors of Ras series, Dunzhin. All games in this series are early graphical Roguelikes. The story is quite simple: Enter the mystical monster-infested dungeon Kaiv, slay monsters and grab treasures. <br><br>You explore the dungeon in a turn-based manner by entering commands in text adventure, like "MOVE NORTH" or "LIGHT TORCH". The commands may be abbreviated by one or two letters. You can also move several squares at once (like "MOVE EAST 3") to speed up your quest. Another very helpful command is "SPEED", which makes the game's messages go by faster. Your progress is hindered by traps (acid pools, slimey floors etc., some of which you can escape by quickly pressing a key), thieves who rob you, random teleports and, of course, by a variety of 24 different monsters, ranging from simple Zombies, Wolves or Dwarves up to Wyverns and Vampires.<br><br>The combat system makes the Warriors of Ras series stand out from other roguelikes: Apart from your total hit points, you and the monsters also have hit points and armor for each body party separately. If the hit points of one body part reach zero, you're dead. Each attack must be directed to one of the body parts, some of which are easier to hit than others. You may also "AIM" a hit (which costs some time, but makes the attack more likely to hit) or "FORCE" an attack (this makes it more difficult to hit, but increases the damage). This and the body parts result in a quite tactical combat -- you have to guess or find out the weak parts of your opponent and choose the right way of attacking.<br><br>Kaiv extends the originally quite simple game of Dunzhin by adding a shop at the dungeon entrance where you can equip yourself. You now also have a bigger variety of items like torches, crosses (against Vampires) and mirrors (against Gorgons), and you can also find magical items: several rings, wands or potions that improve your magical or physical protection or increase you fighting skills. You also need to take enough food and drink with you to prevent dying from hunger or thirst.<br><br>The difficulty level of the game is quite high with new characters -- you often die just by being hit once by a low-level monster or by stepping into some trap. The game is generous in allowing you to save your progress at any time.

Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans.<br><br>Carmen Sandiego is an game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.

Description=The fourth game in the acclaimed Wizardry series, The Return of Werdna took a decidedly different approach from all the games that preceeded it. Instead of playing as a party of six player generated chracters, in Wizardry IV you filled the shoes of Werdna, the evil Archmage who you fought at the end of the original Wizardry.<br><br>It seems that after he was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, Werdna was imprisoned at the bottom of his 10 level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he's out for revenge.<br><br>At the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.<br><br>As Werdna, you'll slowly regain your magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany you on your journey. Your goal is to get to the surface and get your amulet (and hopefully a little revenge). But in your way are a variety of monsters, guardians, and gung-ho adventurers out for your head. Not to mention being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of your old enemy Trebor. Make it to the surface, and you'll have to face one final grudge match against the heroes who defeated you in the past before you can get your amulet.<br><br>Wizardry IV features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics that was used in the previous 3 Wizardry (and used one final time in Wizardry V). Unlike every other game in the entire series, you cannot import characters from the previous game (for obvious reasons). The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series. Wizardry IV is generally considered to be the most difficult game in the entire series, and experience with the other games in the series is recommended.

Following your party's success in that adventure, they were inducted into Trebor's personal honor guard. Unfortunately this particular honor didn't last very long as Trebor's madness and obsession with the amulet and preventing Werdna's return drove him to suicide.<br><br>With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn. Unfortunately this peace didn't last very long. Besides Werdna, it seems that there was another evil fella living in Llylgamyn named Davalpus. With Werdna dead and out of the limelight, Davalpus felt it was time to make his move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself supreme dictator for life.<br><br>Don't worry, this game isn't about preparing for a big final battle with Davalpus. That's already been done for you. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. Unfortunately the god Gnilda, more than a bit ticked off with all this bickering, took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land from invasion by hostile outlanders, someone will need to venture into the temple and get it back along with Gnilda's blessing. That someone is you.<br><br>In order to hold the staff one of your party members will need to retrieve all five pieces of the legendary armor and become the Knight of Diamonds. Only then may they quest for the staff and return it to it's rightful place. But beware, each of the the armor pieces is a living entities and will not be taken without a fight.<br><br>Wizardry II uses the same basic engine and graphics as the previous game.

Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.
