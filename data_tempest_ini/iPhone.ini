Description=3D Lawn Darts takes the classic game of lawn darts and brings it to mobile devices.  Lawn darts is a game played outside where you lob big metal darts at a circle on the ground.  The game was banned in the United States and Canada because of all the injuries.<br><br>The unique thing with 3D Lawn Darts (besides having a full 3D game on a mobile device) is that it uses real motion for throwing the darts.  The way this works is that the mobile device must have a camera that the game can use.  Then during the game, it vibrates to let you know to toss the dart.  Once the person feels the vibration, he/she then makes a throwing motion while a picture is taken.  The game then analyzes the pictures blur to decide where the dart goes.  Once the motion is made he/she can view the screen and follow the dart in the 3D world through the air till it hits the target.<br><br>Besides the motion other features of the game are choice of 3D world (4 choices), choice of player to throw the dart (4 choices again) and different types of darts to throw.  Dart choices include flaming darts, nuclear darts, magnetic darts, and more.

Description=The 7th Guest is a puzzle-adventure game which takes place inside an abandoned mansion. Venture into the 22 rooms of the spooky mansion, solve over 20 mind-bending puzzles to unravel a tale of revenge and horror that took place in the 1930s.<br><br>The owner of the mansion was Henry Stauf, a famous maker of children's toys. Once a homeless drifter and thief, influenced by a vision in a dream, Henry invented a wondrous doll, so incredibly life-like that it sold like wildfire. Stauf's toys became popular overnight bringing fame and fortune and changing his rags to riches. But things took a tragic turn when owners of the doll became infected with a fierce and deadly virus. None of those children recovered.<br><br>After this turn of events Stauf secluded himself inside his estate, stopped making his toys and never came into contact with the outside world for a long time. Something very strange happened when six people receive an invitation to a party at the mansion. By solving the riddles inside Stauf's "fun house", you'll delve into the past to learn what happened to them, and the mysterious 7th guest, on that fateful night.<br><br>The game is played in first person perspective with a point-and-click interface featuring horror-themed animated cursors (skeletons, bulging-eye skulls etc.). It is one of the first games to be released on the then-new CD-Rom media. The graphics are fully rendered in SVGA, and real actors and actresses bring the story to life during numerous full-motion video cut scenes. The visuals are accompanied by an original, orchestrated musical score.<br><br>To finish the game, you must solve the puzzles in Stauf's manor; each solved puzzle will unlock new rooms or new movie sequences to watch. The puzzles are quite varied; there's the classic "eight queens puzzle", another puzzle where you need to compose a sentence by rearranging letters, and others. If you get stuck, you can visit the library; a book within will give you hints on the puzzle. If the hints aren't enough, the puzzle will solve itself automatically once you consult the book enough times. <br><br>Some later, limited releases of the game came with a separate video that included a "behind the scenes" look at the making of the game and interviews with the developers.

It is loosely based on the movie's story, borrowing from it main characters such as Alice, the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the March Hare and the Mad Hatter.<br><br>It is a 2D platform puzzle game bearing some similarities to The Lost Vikings series. The main objective in each stage is take Alice from left to right until the end of the stage. The stages can be transposed either by taking Alice through Wonderland or through a mirror version of Wonderland, accessed by mirrors which will work like doorways. Some mirrors will be shattered, so Alice will need to collect the missing pieces to fix and then use them.<br><br>Alice can only run right and left or jump. In order to proceed in some locations, the player must swap Alice for the other characters, which she will find along the way. Each character has a special ability and can be called upon just to use them, not to move. The White Rabbit can stop time for some objects; the Cheshire Cat can make objects appear and disappear; the March Hare can use telekinesis to move an object from a point to another and the Mad Hatter can transform objects from one world to another. Some locations will demand the combination of two or more characters' abilities. When the player reaches the end of a stage, a map of Wonderland will be shown, displaying the next location available as well as the already completed ones. As new characters join Alice's party, the player can replay a stage to reach specific areas which weren't reachable before (without those character abilities). <br>Some low ceiling areas will require Alice to drink the "drink me" bottle to be transposed, only to eat the "eat me" candy to regain her normal size.<br><br>The obstacles faced are mostly water sections, bottomless pits, spikes and the like. There are Red Queen soldiers in some stages, which can't be killed, only bypassed. Some stages have passages similar to holes opened by torn portions of a book page. In those passages, Alice will find hidden objects, which can be collected and accessed in Alice's journal outside the game. The iPhone version also offers different ways of unlocking those objects, with the player's GPS, Camera and Photo Library. Some other objects can be unlocked by solving riddles or by logging in on specific dates, such as the date when Alice's original Disney movie was released.

At the start of the game, the player can choose between three types of units, differing in one of three aspects: speed, agility and propagation. Propagation is especially important since units can't be built but are instead automatically generated in all anthills occupied by the player. At the start of each of the 51 missions the player mostly has only one anthill with a few units already inside at his disposal. Scattered around the map are uninhabited anthills and of course anthills owned by the enemy.<br><br>Since new units are generated in anthills, the player has to capture other anthills in order to increase production. This is accomplished by selecting one or more anthills with at least 7 ants in them and sending them to the desired target. If the player's army is greater than the one currently in that anthill, he'll vanquish the foes and gain control over the hill. Once every enemy anthill has been claimed by the player this way, he wins.

Other abilities such as interrogation and pickpocketing is performed this time through mini-games, that make use of the touch screen of the DS. In addition, Altaïr can gain new abilities through gathering of blue orbs scattered through the maps (short of gaining "experience").

Description=Atlantis Sky Patrol is a marble shooter game with steampunk and Art Deco themes. A twisting track occupies most of the screen state, with lines of multi-colored spheres entering it from one end and rolling towards the exit. The objective is to clear the field by making matches of three or more balls of the same color. The player controls a ship that moves sideways at the bottom, aiming and shooting the matching spheres towards the moving strings. Each level has a series of static balls outside the tracks, that have to be matched and destroyed to stop new marble lines from entering the field. If three or more spheres enter the exit, the game is over and the level has to be restarted.<br><br>Matches of long chains cause explosions that shower down various power-ups and coins, where the ship must be moved quickly to pick up all the falling items before they disappear at the bottom. The power-ups are used automatically after being collected. The Power Ball acts as a wildcard, matching spheres of any color. The Rainbow Hammer throws several balls at the same time. The Rewind moves the lines back to the start. The Color Scanner removes all the spheres of one specific color. The Soul of Atlantis shoots a vertical beam, destroying several marbles in its path. The Orichalchum Bomb explodes the balls surrounding its landing spot.<br><br>The coins are used on separate shop screen between levels, to buy helpful upgrades. The accuracy upgrade adds an aiming laser to the ship. Speed upgrades make the ship shoot faster. The bonus magnet attracts all the falling items, making it easier to catch all of them. Rewinder upgrades increase the number of bonus items at the end of each level. The disrupter delays the release of new marble strings. Every upgrade has several levels, each gradually more expensive and stronger.<br><br>A mini-game appears between levels, where the goal is to shoot the large, floating spheres bouncing around to collect bonus items, avoiding hits to the mines that explode the marbles.

Power-ups scattered around the level including a helmet which allows the bird to destroy objects even on his way up and an umbrella which slows down his descent help the player to get the highest score possible. In order to score points, the bird on the other hand needs to collect seeds and destroy as many objects as possible. Bonus points are earned if the player hits the sewer entrance on his way down or performs a really high climb with just one rocket.

Description=Bit. Trip Beat is a unique combination of Pong and a rhythm game. The game is played by holding the Wii-remote sideways and tilting it away or towards the body. This in turn moves a paddle on the left side of the screen vertically up or down. The objective of the game is to hit the various "balls" with the paddle coming into the screen from the right. The balls are synchronized with the beat of the game's chiptune soundtrack, creating a logical connection between what players are seeing and what they are hearing.<br><br>The screen contains two bars. Hitting a ball will fill up the top bar until it is full. This increases the multiplier and makes the visual effects in the background more complex, thus increasing the difficulty. The lower bar is emptied if the player misses a ball. If the bottom bar is depleted, the game switches into a black and white mode, similar to the original Pong game, where only the Wii-remote's speaker is active. In this mode, the player has to fill the top bar again to return to normal play. If the bottom bar runs out again, the game is over.<br><br>Bit. Trip Beat has a variety of balls the player has to repel. They are colour-coded to indicate their movement type: orange balls bounce off the paddle multiple times, while yellow balls only travel in a straight line for example. Occasionally, bonus items can be picked up with the paddle, which for example change the paddle's size similar to the power-ups found in Breakout.<br><br>At the end of each level, a boss fight awaits the player. Defeating the boss grants access to the next level, of which there are a total of three. After playing through a level once, it can be selected at the main menu.

Description=Bubble Bash! is a modern take on the Bust-a-Move concept with a tropical setting. The playing field consists of several bubbles of different colours. Usually, the aim of the game is to remove all bubbles by linking three bubbles of the same colour to destroy them. You either only have a limited amount of time, or have to prevent the packs of bubbles from reaching the bottom of the screen. Bubbles are launched by the teamwork of three characters. Crab holds the bubble and the other two, Kale and Malia, place it on a pedestal and swing it into the field with a stick.<br><br>The game improves on the concept with the addition of balloons. Instead of a fixed rectangular playing field, there are different floating sections of bubbles held up by a balloon. Certain game types require you to hit the balloon or you can wait until two sections approach each other to launch a bubble in between and cause a chain reaction. Advanced strategies require you to launch bubbles against the bouncing sides of the field, or you can link bubbles near the top of the pack to drag along the ones underneath with the explosion. There are also birds flying by. These can be hit, but they also return all bubbles shot into the void to randomly insert them in the field. The direction of the bubbles you launch is shown by a small guiding line.<br><br>Next to the regular bubbles, there are (super) bomb bubbles (destroys everything it touches), mine bubbles (explodes when hit by another bubble), chameleon bubbles (takes the same colour as the bubbles it comes in contact with), colour bomb bubbles (when hit, it destroys all bubbles of a specific colour), ice bomb bubbles (freezes every bubble it hits), wave bubbles (destroys all bubbles on the same row), balloon inflate/deflate bubbles (lowers or rises the balloons), hidden bubbles (they only show their colour when hit), gift bubbles (releases a collectible item when destroyed), flower bubbles (creates a flower of bubbles of an identical colour), move bubbles, switch bubbles and solid or semi-solid bubbles that are hard to remove.<br><br>The main aim of the game is to help Kale and Malia discover treasure on Bubble Island. By completing sections of the island, you collect pieces of a map. Each section consists of three progressively unlocked tiers of games. After finishing the first two tiers with five games each, a boss level becomes available. The different variations require you to release balloons as fast as possible, burst all bubbles while the characters' platform rises near the top of the screen, clear a screen of bubbles hidden every few seconds, or shoot passing birds holding balloons. New levels and outfits for the characters are unlocked by completing games and gathering collectible items. There is a tutorial explaining the basics and the Crab Fever mode to keep playing a single game until you are bust. The game's theme song is a digitized version of Nena's 99 Luftballons.

The mobs can't wait so Randal has to either pay them $50,000 each week or get killed. The player therefore has to do whatever he can to earn as much money as possible, whether it's through taxi driving, car theft, assassinations or pizza delivery. Failing to reach the weekly payments will lead to game over.<br><br>The game is similar to the original Grand Theft Auto (the development team actually consists of former DMA Design employees). As with that game, it's a mix of a action and a racing game viewed from a top-down perspective, where players get to explore the city either by foot or behind the wheel of numerous vehicles. Cash is earned by doing jobs for the different gangs in the city. For each day the player is offered four different criminal jobs and in addition to these, jobs like taxi driving and pizza delivery are always available. To help the player get to the right locations a GPS is available.

Description=Cartoon Wars: Gunner is a spin-off of the tower-defense-game Cartoon Wars. The player takes on the role of Captain J. who had been attacked by assassins sent by the King. The Captain survived the attack badly injured and fled deep into the mountains. After a bit of resting and healing he's seeking revenge.<br><br>To get to the king, the player has to survive the journey back to the castle. Each level represents a small part of this journey and is viewed from the side with the main character able to move in any direction of the screen a limited way. His only goal: to destroy every one of the 30 different types of enemy that come walking (or flying) into the screen. To do so he has initially only access to a bow but during the course of the game he can unlock 10 additional weapons including a mech-suit but carry only three at the same time.<br><br>Each weapon as well as the Captain J. himself can be upgraded using gold which is earned for each kill he makes. Upgrades include a higher health regeneration, a higher shot-frequency and active/passive skills. The active skills are essentially spells like a rain of fire which need mana in order to be cast. Captain J. starts every level with no mana at all and gains it slowly automatically (depending on the upgrade level) and by killing enemies.

Unlike other tile matching games, you don't move the tile (in this case the Chuzzle), but you actually move the entire row so that you get 3 same colored Chuzzles in a group. They then "explode" and the gap is filled with new Chuzzles. Row moving is possible due to the fact that the rows (both horizontal and vertical) are "round", meaning that moving the outer left Chuzzle one tile to the left will result in appearing of it at the outer right position.<br><br>The four different game modes are: Classic, Speed, Zen and Mind Bender.<br><br>Classic works like explained above, but you will also face mega Chuzzles (2x2 tiles big) which can't move out of the screen and locks, which will lock the two rows where it is located. Locks can be destroyed by making a match (mega Chuzzles by the way too). The game mode is level based. Just score as much points as needed for the level and you proceed with the next one. If you run out of possible matches, you can scramble the screen (basically this equals the lost of a life).<br><br>Speed is like Classic, but you play against the clock. With each match, the counter is set a bit back, but as soon as the counter reaches the top, one Chuzzle will be locked. This goes until no moves are possible. Once you completed the level, the locks are reset.<br><br>Zen is a relaxing mode. No locks and no clock.<br><br>In Mind Bender, you job is to recreate a certain given pattern with your 36 Chuzzles. No clock and no special level order required to play.<br><br>For the first three game modes, if you don't know any further, you can buy a hint (reduction of the score).<br><br>The major feature of the game are the trophies. In the Trophy Room, you see 22 placeholders for trophies, which will be awarded as soon as you met the requirements. Those are for example for seven-step cascades (you make one match, which will trigger six additional matches), beating 10 levels of Classic, making a six tiles long match, or playing a game without using a hint and much much more.

The player must use logic to discover the remaining spots and complete the figure.<br><br>The main difference this time is the addition of multiple colors per picture, instead of the monochromatic approach of other titles. Players can select back and forth between colors by clicking on the palette at the side of the screen. Cells can be painted individually or as a group by clicking and dragging across them with the cursor. In each color option, cells can be marked with an X to point them out as incorrect places. Any mistakes are corrected automatically, affecting the final score.<br><br>New levels are unlocked with each completed picture. They are organized by picture theme at the level selection menu. Every time a line or column is completed, the clue numbers become grayed out and a shower of candies, fairies and other theme-related items fall from it to the bottom of the screen.

If there is an even larger creature above those two creatures, the larger creature will swallow them up immediately, resulting in something called a food chain, which gives the player more points.

Afterwards, the player will be upgraded to a medium sized rock and then a three rock variation, then being upgraded to a large rock and its three rock variation.  The bomb will be the last projectile to be unlocked and like the rocks, it will be eventually upgraded to a three-bomb variation.<br><br>To fire the trebuchet, the player must click the left mouse button to initiate launch, clicking again when it reaches a desired height to launch their projectiles.  The screen will automatically center upon the castle so the player can witness the destruction where they click the left mouse button again to return to the trebuchet and repeat the process.  There is also a reset button in case the player doesn't like how they are doing, however it can not be used if all their targets are eliminated or after the final shot has been taken.<br><br>There is no health system or a points system, but does feature a three second time limit once the player's final shot has made contact with the castle.

Money earned by destroying invaders can be used between levels to fund development of major castle towers, or to increase the &quot;health&quot; of the castle.

Archers will pick off incoming invaders.  The more mages there are, the more offensive spells will be available and the more quickly they'll recharge.

Description=Ten years down the line, this strategy game of demonic dominoes is remade with new, cuter graphics for a touch-screen (along the way, reducing its playfield from 12x12 to 8x8).  The high and low is: nasty red demons have invaded the kingdom's suspiciously grid-like battlefield, and threaten to overwhelm its defenses as they randomly proliferate from round to round.  The player is in charge of mustering the defenses (with nine different unit types to draw on, randomly dealt, making the most of their unique fire pattern) in such a fashion that in a given round they eliminate as many of the invaders as possible in grand chain reactions.  If at the end of a round there remain more than 10 demons on the battlefield, the player has lost.

Description=The mole Jerry has a problem, his home is about to be crushed by a huge amount of gems, which moving toward him. <br><br>You are playing Jerry and your job is to prevent this event, the crushed home.<br><br>Your job is to create a row of 3 gems of the same kind. To do so, you first collect gems, by standing beneath a certain gem, then you can catch this (or these) gem(s). You will catch all gems of the same kind which are vertically adjacent, so if there is one, you catch one, if there are five, you catch five. Once you have a certain gem type in your hands, you can now either throw them back, to create a 3 gems row, or you can catch other gems of the same kind, before you throw them all back.<br><br>If you attach those gems to a bulk of gems, you can remove dozens of gems once you created a 3 kind row. Gems which were below those gems, which are removed now, will fall back to attach to the others.<br><br>A level consists of a playfield, which has at the beginning 7 rows with 9 gems each. The longer you take in a level, the more rows appear on the playfield. Once there are 10 rows, you only have a few seconds to get rid of the 10th row, or the game ends. The rows are increasing simply because each level has a pre-defined amount of gems, i.e. 120 for the first level, so 14 rows are possible.<br><br>From level to level, the gem dropping speed will increase. So, at the beginning you have plenty of time for thinking, but later, you better think fast.<br><br>But not only the level speed increases over the levels, but also the amount of power-ups and obstacles available.<br><br>Obstacles are coal, rock, and slime. Once you caught a gem, which is beneath a rock, the rock will fall down. If you standing in the way, you are knocked out some seconds. If you don't stand in the way, the rock will just smash and is gone then. This also applies to the slime bottle, but, when the bottle is smashed, the slime will be some time at the ground and the ground will become slippery. Coal is a blocker, it won't fall down, except you catch it. It will smash if you throw it back.<br><br>Power-ups are the Stonelifter, which will lift all gems some rows up. The Bomb, once thrown up, it will explode and destroy some adjacent gems. And the Rifle, which will destroy all gems in two adjacent vertical rows.<br><br>Finally, there are two special gems, the Magic Stone, which will remove all same colored gems, even not adjacent ones, once it is used in one of the 3 gems rows. And the Diamond, which will change the type of many adjacent gems in the type of gems, which it is attached to.

Speedy service and good atmosphere is needed to keep the customers happy, and keeping them happy is the best way to get huge tips.<br><br>The player must balance service for the five different customer types, each with their own quirks. For example, the business lady is very impatient, but eats very fast and gives very big tips, while the senior citizen is extremely patient, slow to eat, and cheap (he's got to save his retirement money, after all).

In addition to this, the game only starts with the screen half-full, and gradually fills the screen up with more objects as you play.<br><br>The Pro version of Doodle Find is identical to the free release, except that it removes the in-game ads, and includes an extra mode of play, called "Marathon".  In this mode, you must find as many objects as possible.  While there is no fixed time limit, you only have a few seconds to find each item.  If you take too long to find an item, the game will end.  Unlike "Classic" Doodle Find, high scores in "Marathon" do not reset weekly, making it more challenging to get onto the high score table.

Description=DOOM II RPG is a follow-up in the style of the Wolfenstein RPG, chronologically set before the events in DOOM RPG. Thanks to secret experiments, the various UAC Bases on Mars, the Moon, Earth and wherever else the cooperation has set foot have experienced incidents involving demons. A team of soldiers including a scientist are sent to Tycho Station on the Moon to investigate. But right at the start, the team is separated and the player is left behind alone to find his way through the station and even Hell itself in order to find and destroy the source of all the problems.<br><br>As with its predecessor, DOOM II RPG  is a first-person role-playing game. The shooter's quick action has been traded in for a slowed down turn-based system where emphasis is placed on using the correct weapons or tools at the right time against the appropriate enemies since each action, be it a step forward, firing a weapon or using a health pack, takes one round. At the start of the game, the player has to choose between one of three characters, changing the stats he starts the game with. While Sarge has a high amount of strength, the scientist has a high IQ but is as agile as a bucket, making him less likely to successfully dodge incoming fire.<br><br>During the course of the game the player earns experience points for killing enemies and subsequently levels up, increasing his stats by doing so. In addition, several mini-games are available that further increase specific skills but also give the player other advantages like a lower price at vending machines or access to a security bot that he can send out to scout the area. As well, several kinds of nano-drinks are available, allowing the character to temporarily boost his stats or make himself immune against fire (which is especially useful against the imps in the game).<br><br>Most of the weaponry and enemies in the game are well-known from the previous games of the DOOM series - including the Soul Cube from DOOM 3, which the player will find in Hell near the end of the game. The most important new addition to the arsenal is the Holy Water Pistol which can be refilled at toilets and other sources of water and scare the demons for a few rounds. Holy Water can also be used to heal the character.

At the Delta Labs of the UAC Research Facility located in Mars City, an experiment triggered an unknown event, resulting in the invasion of the entire facility. Marine forces have been deployed to hot spots everywhere. Bravo Team was sent to the EnPro facility but was ambushed while searching for survivors. One of the first tasks for the players of DOOM³ was to locate said Bravo Team. One thing was not known at that time: not the entire team was killed during the ambush. One other lone marine survived the attack and managed to make his way to the final evacuation ship. In DOOM Resurrection, the player now follows the story of this marine.<br><br>The game is a so-called rail-shooter. Looking through the eyes of the marine, the player automatically moves through the levels on a pre-determined path with scripts triggering every enemy spawn and cutscene. The player's only task is to aim, shoot and dodge incoming fire. To fend off the already known enemies ranging from zombies over dead soldiers to full-grown hellknights, the player has access to up to three weapons at the same time. The assault rifle is the default one with unlimited ammo. All other weapons require ammunition that can found everywhere in the levels and is collected by simply touching the screen at that location. Health kits can be collected in a similar manner. The other weapons include the normal and double-barrel-shotgun, the Gatling gun and the BFG, which are found at pre-determined points during the game.<br><br>The marine is not completely alone on his journey. While a helpful scientist will keep in contact most of the time, a flying robot called Sam follows the player around, opening doors and providing the link to the scientist. If the player is tired of escaping the research facility, he can try and beat one of the available challenges, among which are killing a hellknight without receiving any damage and with 100% accuracy or finishing a section of the game in only one minute.

If this sounds familiar, it's no coincidence -- Zork/Dungeon is the primordial clay from which the first three games of the Zork series were fashioned, following some extensive refitting of set pieces -- due to the game's enormous size of one megabyte, making it commercially available for home microcomputers, with their limited memory and storage capabilities, was not considered a viable plan in 1979... until they came up with the idea of segmenting the giant dungeon up.<br><br>(Ports of this game also exist for VMS, the Acorn Archimedes, and the Z-code, TADS and GLK software platforms.)

Description=Dungeon Scroll brings together two genres never before put together.  Your dungeon crawl is about to begin... and all you have for weapons are a bunch of letters.<br><br>In order to defeat the enemies you find, you will need to complete words using a selection of letters.  Each dungeon level has a series of monsters you need to defeat and you will have to defeat all monsters on that level using the same group of letters without using the same words twice on that level.  Depending on the letters available, this can become challenging... especially when fighting monsters that require you to type many words to defeat them.<br><br>The longer your words are, the more damage you will do... but don't forget those small words, as they can also help you out in a pinch.  You will also occasionally get various special tiles that will increase or multiply damage, heal you, and even show you a large word you can use.<br><br>Completing each level of the dungeon will allow you to find various items.<br><br>You have the option of three skill levels to choose from so that kids and adults can both play the game and be challenged.

The CG intro from the PlayStation/Wonderswan version has also been redone in 16:9.<br><br>There is an entirely new dungeon dubbed "The Labyrinth of Time" which enforces a time limit within which you can explore its dark depths, and also another bonus: an unlockable Yoshitaka Amano Art Gallery which contains beautiful artwork from the artist who has provided the illustrations for many games in the series, and like in the GBA version there is also bestiary and a unlockable BGM music player. Other features do not change the GBA version much, even the the difficulty is the same as in Dawn of Souls.

Description=Gourmania is a combination of management and hidden object games. The player is the owner of a restaurant, and has to prepare dishes and serve the food to arriving customers, within a time limit.<br><br>Each screen shows ingredients scattered throughout the restaurant, and the customer orders at the top of the screen. The order lists the ingredients needed and has a diminishing green meter at the left side showing the customer patience. A satisfied customer pays more. To prepare the food, the player has to find and click on the ingredients.<br><br>After all the ingredients are collected, the more complex recipes require an extra step, showing an icon of a kitchen utensil, like knifes and cutting boards, frying pans and others, that has to be dragged and dropped in an equivalent icon at the top of the screen. This icon has a red meter around it, that shows the progress of the action being performed (slicing, cooking, etc). After the dish is served, the order shows a cash payment that must be quickly collected to allow a new customer.<br><br>Every stage has a minimum money goal, and an expert one. The money accumulated can be spent on new equipment and upgrades, and acquiring the new restaurants that become available as the game progresses.<br><br>A bonus game appears after three stages, where the ingredients have to be placed on scrolling panels showing their silhouettes. Once a panel is full, it disappears. The objective is to fill them as fast as possible to win new recipes.<br><br>There are multiple bonuses for using all the available utensils at the same time, finding the ingredients in order and collecting multiple payments at once. Some stages have hourglasses in the scenery, that add a few minutes to the timer when collected.

Description=The first GTA game to hit the Nintendo DS, Chinatown Wars puts you in control of Huang Lee, a member of the Triads in the modern Liberty City. After his father's assassination, Huang flies in from China to deliver a ceremonial sword to his uncle Wu "Kenny" Lee to ensure the inheritance of the Triad bosses.  However, shortly after his arrival he is jumped, shot, robbed and left for dead, only to survive and vow his vengeance for his father and recover the lost sword to bring honor back to his family.<br><br>While being a traditional mission-based Grand Theft Auto game, Chinatown Wars returns to use the more traditional top-down while still using a new cel-shaded 3D Engine. A lot of the new functionality from the more recent GTA games have been included: like the safehouse, where you can read emails from other characters in the game and store cars and items. Plus there is a programmable GPS system that helps you find your way in the Liberty City more easily.<br><br>A replay feature is also present that allows the player to replay previous missions by accessing these through there safehouse.  While players can make money through completing missions, the player can also engage in drug trading with numerous dealers scattered throughout Liberty City.  There are many drugs to choose from including Coke, Heroin, Acid, Weed among others, buying them cheap and selling to other dealers by checking their market value through their PDA.  From time to time, an e-mail will be sent to the player that will tip them off of dealers that are either selling drugs at a cheap price or buying them at above average market prices.<br><br>However, the player must also be aware that buying in bulk will attract the attention of the police after the deal has been done, causing their star level to instantly rise.  If a player is caught, they will loose all drugs that they are carrying.  They can also carjack drug vans (which are indicated by a red arrow above them) and return them to their safehouse and search them for either drugs or cash.  They can also obtain weapons this way by hijacking Amm-u-nation trucks, but the trucks are heavily-armored and their drivers armed.<br><br>Police chases has also been changed for this version.  While it still features a star level, there is also an icon that resembles cop cars.  While the player can still resort to Pay 'n Spray shops to change the look of their car to throw off the authorities, they can also wreck any pursuing police which will cross out a cop car icon.  If the cop car icons for that level are dropped, their star level will drop as well.  (ex. If the player has two stars and two cop cars, they can wreck two cars, afterwards their star level will be reduced to one star)<br><br>The game also utilizes the DS' capabilities such as using the stylus pen to use a screwdriver to turn the ignition on a car to start it or taking a plate off in the car and using the stylus to hotwire it.  The pen can also be used to scratch off lottery games in stores scattered around in the game and used to throw explosive devices such as grenades and molotov cocktails or even smash objects such as security panels or a windshield of a car when the player goes into the water while in a vehicle.  The microphone can also be used by blowing into it to hail an approaching on-duty taxi.<br><br>The game supports Nintendo WFC for statistics uploading to the Rockstar Social Club and multi-play gaming.<br><br>The PSP version is mostly the same as the DS version. It adds some new missions, as well as new radio stations. Where the touch screen is used on the DS, the PSP version instead uses the analog stick.

He uses the things he steals to help townsfolk and solve problems.  The citizens have given him a nickname - the Moon Dancer.<br><br>Created by Gen Suzuki, maker of Ninja Five-O, Grappling Action: Moon Dancer is a side-scrolling platformer that is played with the iPhone's accelerometer and touch screen.  The player moves Moon Dancer by tilting the device left or right, and throws out his grapple by tapping the screen where you want the grapple to end.  As with Bionic Commando, Moon Dancer cannot jump and thus must use his grapple to traverse through all terrain.  The grapple can also be used to snag far-off objects while Moon Dancer is flying through the air - he also gains bonus multipliers for every moon coin he grabs without touching the ground (up to a maximum of x8).<br><br>Depending on the level, Moon Dancer must either find one or more objects and either give them to people, or use them (such as a key to unlock a door).  By swiping the bottom of the screen from left to right, the inventory is displayed, allowing Moon Dancer to use items.  The other goal a level may have is to reach the exit - in this kind of level, it's up to Moon Dancer to find the exit, which is marked by a large arrow that points him in the right direction.

Description=The Graveyard is a short game described by the authors as an explorable painting, an experiment in storytelling with real-time poetry without the use of words. It tries to evoke a feeling and tell an elaborate story with a small segment of gameplay. The player controls an elderly woman, shown from a third-person perspective. She visits a graveyard. The exploration is limited as she can only move towards a bench in front of a church. Struck by her age, she moves about slowly and needs a cane to keep her balance. She can sit down on the bench and then exit the graveyard again.<br><br>Although the game elements seem limited - the camera restricts the player from entering any of the side paths - the woman's story is told through a song that starts playing when she sits down. The lyrics are in Dutch, but they are transcribed in English at the bottom of the screen. The full version of the game introduces a random time of death for the woman, not allowing the player to exit the graveyard and enhancing the drama. The game is entirely in black and white, but there are various lighting effects and birds flying around.

Description=Gravity Hook HD is a remake of the 2008 browser game Gravity Hook. It is a pixel-based vertical scrolling game where the player attempts to use a futuristic grappling hook to climb out of an underground, secret base in order to reach the surface.<br><br>Using the grappling hook the player latches onto free-floating, explosive nodes and pulls themselves rapidly toward them in order to build up momentum and fling themselves ever upward. When the player latches onto a node it is dragged downward by their weight, further distancing themselves from the next node; the faster the player is rising the less of an effect this has. Nodes are by default non-threatening, however those that the player is tethered to become armed, forcing the player to release themselves before they come in contact with it; failure to do so results in the death of the player and restarts the game.<br><br>A score is kept of the player's progress, measured by how many meters they have managed to climb. In order to enhance the game's replayability the distribution of the nodes is randomized each time.<br><br>Important changes to the HD release include revamped graphics and more diversity in the types of nodes. Some nodes (green) can now be touched without any kind of harm, while others (blue) detonate when the character collides with them. The controls have also been altered slightly and the overall pace has been slowed down. Upon reaching a set amount of metres the original Gravity Hook game is unlocked as a Classic mode.

Though this king is best known historically for his codification of laws and edicts, composed and engraved in cuneiform tablets ~1780 BC, the game veers away from lawmaking and the pursuit of justice in favour of guiding your population of subjects to stable, contented growth.  The game puts it, somewhat blandly, in other words:<br><br>YOUR TASK IS TO DEVELOP A STABLE ECONOMY BY THE WISE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR RESOURCES. YOU WILL BE BESET FROM TIME TO TIME BY NATURAL EVENTS.<br>Results of your actions are narrated to you in plain text; player input primarily consists of punching in numbers and selecting the occasional YES and NO (the end of every turn typically asking you DO YOU WISH TO ABDICATE?) into your keyboard, touchscreen -- or TeleType terminal.  Gameplay and interaction are restrictive, but the minimalist number-crunching is foundational for all the managerial leadership games that followed: You can buy and sell acres of land, purchasing extra bushels of grain to sow in your fields or feed your populace if so needed.  Between turns (only 10 on the iPhone version), citizens starve and are laid low by plagues, peasants immigrate to replace them, and vermin deplete your stores of grain reserves.  One year is much the same as the next, though the particular numerical values shift according to elegant algorithms the deeper understanding of which will lead you to a fruitful and harmonious reign, concluding with enthusiastic congratulations from the computer:<br><br>A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE!!! CHARLEMAGNE, DISRAELI, AND JEFFERSON COMBINED COULD NOT HAVE DONE BETTER!

You need to help him shoot the hearts by writing their numbers before they crash down on the ground, heartbroken (literally!)!<br><br>Gameplay consists of helping Ai-kun by writing the numbers of the colored hearts that slowly drift down from the top of the screen to shoot at them. Shooting multiple hearts with the same color rewards you with "hit bonuses" at the end of each level. The objective is to fill the Love Barometer all the way up to clear each stage. Missing hearts and letting them fall to the bottom will reduce your score and the Love Barometer. There are also different kinds of colored numerical hearts, such as hearts you must touch to reveal the number, hearts that change color when tapped, hearts that constantly change color and will only focus on a specific color when tapped or a heart with wings you must quickly shoot at to activate the temporary powerup "Love Barrier". You can also collect golden coins, and when you have 50 coins in possession, the "LoveMachine" slot machine will appear and automatically start to play. The LoveMachine will randomly stop the reels on it's own, and will reward you with bonus points if it gets three of the same reel in a row, and will continue playing for 25 coins per reel spin.<br><br>On occasion, a gift box will show up. Touching the box will trigger either one of three things, a math quiz, "Wheel of Luck" or the appearance of Ai-kun's "little friend" (a devil) on the playfield. The math quiz requires you to quickly answer one or more easy math problems under a short amount of time so you can "win a gift for your lover" - answer well and you are rewarded with the "gift" which will give you bonus points. The "Wheel of Luck" is an event where a wheel (with eight segments, half of them being a picture of Ai-kun, and the other half a picture of a dark blue cloud with a face (Thunder)) will automatically appear and spin itself. If the arrow lands on Ai-kun, the player will be rewarded with "Super Shot", in which Ai-kun will clone himself into three and will automatically shoot every heart on screen for temporary amount of time - if it lands on Thunder, the player will be punished via the "Thunder" penalty, in which Thunder will appear from the top of the screen and blow a gust of wind which will push all of the hearts down to the bottom of the screen, thus reducing the player's score and Love Barometer. Ai-kun's "little friend" can appear from the box, in which he will break the hearts slowly drifting down on the screen. To defeat him, you have to wait for a number to appear on him just before he breaks another heart, and then quickly write said number down to shoot at him.<br><br>After clearing a stage and before moving on to the next, you will enter a bonus round to earn some more points, in which the bonus round would be either a color matching game, or collecting the hearts falling through pinball/pachinko-like pins from Ai-kun's "little friend" into Ai-kun's basket.<br><br>There are 40 levels in all to complete. There's also an optional two player mode called "Love Test", where two players (or "lovers") will take turns in order to calculate the two players' love for each other.

Description=Map My Mind is a trivia puzzle game where the player progresses through differently themed maps (game boards) by answering questions and the goal is to end up on specific points on the map. These maps are made up out of links that each connect two nodes. The nodes include keywords that are in turn linked to a question and if the player can answer it correctly then the next path along his progression of the map will be uncovered. Players can choose the route that they want to proceed along depending on the theme or subject that they know most about to try to improve on their chances.<br><br>Map My Mind features different question types like for instance order and pair-matching questions and wildcards that the player can use to help him progress through the maps. These work by making answering the questions a little easier for the player. The 50% wildcard removes half of the possible answers and the Ask the host wildcard allows the player to doublecheck his answer before committing to it. While answering a question incorrectly will lock the question and effectively block the players progression path he can use up one of his three lifelines to unlock the question again and try it again. Exploring the map will allow the player to find and unlock more wildcards and lifelines for use but in order to access them the player must first complete a mini-game.<br><br>Map My Mind comes bundled with 15 maps covering different subjects including but not restricted to: Movies, Geography, Sports, Pop and Rock Music, Superheroes and History. There is also the possibility to download some extra maps covering other subjects.<br><br>In addition to the main Map mode the game includes a Trivia mode in which the player either has a limited time to answer a certain number of questions, or a survival mode where he can play until he answers a question incorrectly. The game offers online leader boards, which allow players to compare themselves to others in their region, country or around the world.

When activated, the monocle becomes the cursor and covers the screen with a green filter, replacing the list with a meter showing how close the cursor is to the hiding entity. Each soul has to be found and clicked three times to be exorcised. The biographies of exorcised ghosts are added to a list with details about their former lives.<br><br>At the end of each chapter, the player has to find an extra place by deciphering a rebus puzzle, where words are combined with pictures of collected objects to complete a clue about the secret area.

His first goal is to leave Scabb Island and later his search for Big Whoop gets more personal because an old enemy comes back to life...<br><br>Regarding gameplay the game doesn't change much in comparison to its predecessor: the player explores his environment, solves item based puzzles and talks to a lot of people through multiple choice dialogues.

The title makes use of a facetious-horror design that provides a sense of levity in an otherwise murky setting.<br><br>Gameplay is founded on the simplicity and plainness of the board game checkers, with each unit being identical to another in terms of function but of varying degrees of strength, which is dictated by the size of the monster. At the beginning of each turn players move one of their respective monster balls up to two spaces in any direction across the game board. If the monster ball lands on a space already occupied by an opponent then they battle, with the larger of the two swallowing the smaller and growing in proportion to the size of the devoured enemy. In the event that a monster grows too large it explodes, thereby depriving the player of one of their pieces.<br><br>As an additional factor there are numerous special tiles, such as rocket launchers and fortresses, strewn across the board, which are activated when landed on. Also present are 'mystery' tiles, whose effects vary widely, from indiscriminate rocket launcher attacks to a functionless shimmer of sparkles. Depending on the type of tile that is used it will either have only one use, disappearing afterward, or it will remain on the board for the entirety of the game; new special tiles occasionally appearing at random on the board to replace those used.<br><br>The game is presented as an assortment of unrelated scenarios, rather than a cohesive campaign, each with their own theme or play style. Each of the scenarios has a uniquely sized board and one of two victory conditions; obliterating all of the enemy monsters or instead capturing their flag. Additional scenarios can be downloaded within the game to add to those included with it.<br><br>A system of trophy rewards is supported within the game which rewards the player with either a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum award based on their accomplishments. Among the available trophies that players can gain are "Killing Spree", "Rocketeer", and "Death or Glory".

Description=Motocross Challenge is a 2D side-scrolling motorcycle game combining regular racing and tricks. The game can only be played through an emulator or a GBA flashcard but is not strictly homebrew. It is a game made by a commercial developer, but when the project was cancelled by two publishers, they decided to release the game for free. The game can also be ordered on a cartridge from the developer's website. In 2010 it was followed up with an iPhone/iPad release.<br><br>The tracks remind of Excitebike while the gameplay seems inspired by Motocross Maniacs. The game offers two main modes: Free Ride (choose an unlocked bike and track to practise) and Challenge. The Challenge mode involves a series of events in 3 major categories: Beat the Clock (time-based), Trick Attack (points-based) and World Tour (race against 3 AI opponents). When all courses are finished, the final event, MXC Championship, is unlocked. The events are divided over different trees and completing certain courses unlocks new tracks or one of the 8 available bikes. The bikes have different statistics based on speed, handling, acceleration, height, boost and suspension.<br><br>Gameplay involves a fair amount of physics. When the bike accelerates, the front wheel leaves the ground and this needs to be compensated by nudging the d-pad. Up and down on the d-pad is used to switch lanes. Many tricks (activated through the L-button) involve balance and constant correcting is needed. Next to accelerating, braking and tricks, there is a button for boost. Only a limited amount is offered, but it constantly regenerates at a slow rate. It is used to gain extra speed, especially before big jumps to gain extra air time. The full amount of boost should never be used or let maxed out, as too little or too much slows the bike down. While in the air, using a combination of the L-button and the d-pad, players can perform tricks such as superman, nac-nac of backflip. By completing Trick Attack events, new tricks can be unlocked.<br><br>There are different types of tracks, set on a beach, an arena, downtown, in the snow, in a forest, in a desert and even a dump. They contain a series of jumps but also areas that slow down the bike, along with obstacles. The game screen shows the current position of the player (in World Tour), the current location on the track along with the finish, the time (remaining time in Beat the Clock), the current lap (in World Tour), the boost meter and the amount of points for a trick, and the remaining trick points needed (in Trick Attack). The game supports passwords to save and restore the player's progress.

Description=Osmos is a game where the player controls a substance in an enclosed environment, reminiscent of flOw. By touching smaller objects, they can be absorbed, merging to create a larger substance. The substance is controlled through the mouse with a mechanism similar to the classic Asteroids. The mouse is used to choose a direction and gentle clicks, or holding the mouse button, provide acceleration in short bursts, steadily moving the object in a certain direction until touching a border or being slowed down by another object. Moving however causes to leave behind small droplets of fluid, rendering it smaller. When touching an object larger than itself, the player's substance gets absorbed.<br><br>The levels are set in enclosed environments where zooming can be done freely. After a few tutorials levels, different paths are offered based on variations on the concept. Some of them are based on aggressively tracking another organism or surviving in a crowded environment, another set is about an orbital course floating around a large object, and the final one is the slowest where there is very little space and the area needs to be captured with caution. In levels with limited manoeuvrability, time can be speed up or slowed down to prevent losing too much fluid when going slowly. Levels are usually won by capturing a specific organism (there are many, with different abilities) or growing to a certain size. In later levels antimatter is introduced, with the opposite effect or regular organisms.<br><br>The gameplay is supported by soothing, ambient electronic music.

To make things more difficult, numerous obstacles get in his way including construction workers, rogue tires, skateboarders, dogs and cats and more. If the player hits one of these he immediately looses one life. If all lives have been lost or the player has lost all his customers by not delivering a paper or destroying their property, the game ends. Additional lives are added when the player earns enough points. Points are earned depending on where the newspaper lands. If the player hits the mailbox of a customer, he gets more points than hitting the doormat. Houses of non-customers on the other hand give points when windows break or the player drives over the priceless flowers in the yard. At the end of each day, a training course awaits for additional points.<br><br>New in this version are the enhanced graphics in the classic isometric view and the optional 3D-view as well as three new game-modes. Besides the classic-mode where everything plays exactly as the original, there's the somewhat easier casual-mode. Here points and such can also be earned by collecting cards scattered on the ground. The other modes are time-attack, finish the day as fast as possible, and the challenge-mode where the player has to fulfill certain objectives during his workday.

Description=Penguin Angel is a casual game for the iPhone. In the game, penguins have escaped from the London Zoo and are wandering the city streets, while at the same time - in a nod to Charles Fort's work on historical anomalies - strange objects are raining from the sky. The player takes control of the penguins' guardian angel, who protects them by pushing away falling objects before they hit the penguins. There are 3 levels of difficulty and 19 stages to complete.<br><br>The game uses the device's accelerometer as the control input. Players tilt the device up, down, left and right to control a guardian angel that flies above the penguins. The goal is to use the angel to push the falling objects away from the penguins. Each level is a timed stage, occurring in a different location in Victorian London. Players receive the "Perfect" badge if they complete a level without any of their penguins having been hit; this award carries over to later levels as long as no penguins are hit.<br><br>The game stands out because of its distinctive Victorian art style and quirky aesthetics. The art direction used original prints from the nineteenth century as the basis of the game art, from the characters to the backgrounds. The game levels progress through a series of street and city scenes, gradually leading to a cemetery in the final three levels. The falling objects also become increasingly menacing, with the bicycles and clocks of the early levels giving way to pianos, skeletal horses, and scimitars later on.<br><br>The game's idiosyncrasy comes through in other touches. The penguins, somewhat mysteriously, wear a variety of hats, sashes, and ties publicized in Victorian magazines. A peculiar comic figure, waving a wreath and a banner saying "Cheers!", pops down from the  top of the screen after the player has pushed a certain number of objects away. The game's difficulty levels are not easy, medium, and hard, but rather "Easy-Peasy," Middling," and "Dreadful." The game also uses fonts typical of nineteenth-century publications.

Description=Plants vs. Zombies belongs to the "tower defense" sub-genre of casual games, where the objective is to deploy a series of stationary weapons to protect a structure against hordes of enemies. Plants provide the artillery, and can be bought with sun power, the game's currency. The enemies are zombies invading a suburban lawn. At the start of each level, the player starts to plant the available seeds on the lawn in a strategic manner. Zombies slowly begin to appear from the street at the right side, just a few initially, and must be destroyed before they can reach the house on the other side. Sun power icons falls from the sky randomly, and must be collected with the mouse to increase the funds. The sunflower can be planted to generate extra units of sun power, but doesn't have any attack power against the invading undead. Besides their cost, the seed packs take some time to recharge after being used.<br><br>There are several types of offensive plants available. Pea shooters are the basic variety, spitting a projectile forwards every few seconds. Variations appear later in the game, shooting several peas at the same time and freezing the enemies, making them move slower. The carnivorous plant gobbles up a zombie when he gets near its gaping mouth, but takes some time to do so, becoming ineffective while busy digesting the corpse. The cherry bomb explodes after being deployed, carbonizing any of the undead surrounding its landing spot. The potato mine is half-buried with a sensor sticking from the top, and detonates when one of the walking dead steps on it. Plants can be removed with the shovel to make space for new ones.<br><br>Mini-games appear from time to time. There are twenty of them, and most are parodies of well-known casual titles: ZomBotany (1 and 2), Wall-nut Bowling (1 and 2), Slot Machine, It's Raining Seeds, Beghouled, Invisi-ghoul, Seeing Stars, Zombiquarium, Beghouled Twist, Big Trouble Little Zombie, Portal Combat, Column Like You See 'Em, Bobsled Bonanza, Zombie Nimble Zombie Quick, Whack a Zombie, Last Stand, Pogo Party, and Dr. Zomboss's Revenge. After being played once, they become available directly from the main menu.<br><br>The game has three gameplay modes. In the main adventure mode, levels get progressively more difficult, and at the end of each one the player receives a new plant for the arsenal. Puzzle mode has two variations: "Vasebreaker", where the goal is to break the vases scattered on the lawn, to uncover plants or zombies and use the former to fight the latter, and "I, Zombie", where the player controls the zombies against the plants. In survival mode, the zombies attack in turns. After each turn, the player can choose plants from the arsenal. There are three types of survival: normal (one wave per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, hard (two waves per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, and endless (two waves per turn, endless amount of turns) on the pool map.<br><br>The Zen Garden stores all the available plants, where they have to be tended, watered, fertilized, sprayed for bugs and listen to music. When they are happy, they drop coins that can be used to buy more plants and other garden additions.

Description=Powerboat Challenge is a powerboat racing game. The player has to race his boat round buoys; red buoys must be passed on the left, the green ones must be passed on the right. The closer the player passes to the buoy, the more style points he or she gets and the more boost is given to the boat. When the boost meter is full, the player can use it to speed up the boat for a while. If one buoy is missed, the player loses all his or her boost charge and the boat slows down; if three buoys are missed, he or she is disqualified from that race. A style rating is also given by the end of each race.<br><br>In race events, arriving among the 3 first places awards the player a medal (gold, silver or bronze) and a prize in money. In time trials the player has to beat a pre-defined time to earn the medals. In eliminator courses the last placed player on each lap gets knocked out and in best overall courses the results are determined not only by the place in which the player gets but how well he or she raced. The money can be used to buy boat upgrades. In the beginning of the game the player can select one of four characters with different ratings on attributes such as top speed, acceleration, agility and turbo. The upgrades bought will improve the boat in those attributes.<br><br>The game features 4 islands (Richmore, Brookfield, Culuá and Akonisos) with different scenarios (swamps, icy seas, rainforest rivers) and events in each of them. Collecting enough medals unlocks new islands. After beating the game with a given character, the player can replay the entire game with a different one.

The goal is to clear tiles by surrounding one or more tiles of a single colour entirely (horizontally and vertically) with tiles of a different colour. The edges of the grid can be used as well. Cleared titles are turned black and can be used again. The surrounding tiles are converted to the colour of the tiles that were cleared.<br><br>Clearing a large group of tiles also provides more points.

Description=Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity is a puzzle game similar to the Incredible Machine series. During the 100 levels the goal is always to press a button. To achieve this goal the player has a selection of items to his disposal - nothing fancier than boards or balls - to build a construction of chain reactions. When he starts the experiment, a ball (in seldom cases a vehicle) gets released to set the thing in motion. An innovation compared to similar games is that the physics simulation doesn't get disabled during the building phase. This means the player can destroy his constructions when being careless during placing another item. There is also a help functions which gives hints to the correct solution.<br><br>By beating levels the player unlocks so-called sandbox levels where he can freely experiment with the physics engine. Mini games, e.g. building a tower which has to withstand an earthquake, can be played against other players. There are a small differences between the versions: the PC version offers an editor to build own experiments and the DS version offers fewer sandbox levels and mini games.

Acceleration and braking is done by dragging the finger up and down on the screen. When using the touch screen to steer it is possible to enable auto acceleration. The cars also has boosting and tackling functionality. To boost the player needs to pick up lighting bolt collectibles that are scattered around the tracks and this gives some extra power briefly. In addition to the lighting bolts there is also laughing skulls which the player has to avoid since they will drain the player's boost. When no boost is left the car slows to a crawl for a few seconds.  Tackling can be done whenever the player is close to a competitor who is then sent spinning. <br><br>The game features three game modes: arcade, time attack and championship.

The only goal is to get the highest score by playing as long as possible and always removing many balls of the same color at once.<br><br>To spice things up, there are four game-modes available to chose from. Besides the mentioned Basic-mode, these are:<br><br>1. Nonstop - When a column gets cleared, new balls are generated.<br>2. Slide - Plays the same as Basic but instead of only dropping down, the balls also slide to the right to fill the empty space when a cluster of balls is cleared.<br>3. Combo - Combines the game-modes Basic, Nonstop and Slide.

You use a paddle (in this case, a paddle attached to a spaceship) to bounce a ball into level after level of bricks with many different properties, all the while revealing power ups or other, less desirable things, such as bombs which will kill you. There are more than two hundred levels to be cleared over two episodes that come with the game.<br><br>There are a few features that set Ricochet Infinity apart from previous games in the Ricochet franchise:<br><br>1. a ring collecting system that unlocks new ships and new balls (referred to as "ion spheres");<br><br>2. a mouse party option that allows a second mouse to be plugged into your computer for head-to-head or cooperative play. This option requires at least Windows XP. However, each mouse can be a USB, a PS/2 or even a serial mouse.<br><br>3. a near-infinite (hence the name) supply of user-created levels that can be downloaded from the company's online server.<br><br>4. a "recall" button. By holding the right mouse button while your ball is in flight, you can exert a gravitational pull between the ball and the paddle, causing the ball to alter it's flight path left or right, depending on where your paddle is in relation to it. This feature works in quite a similar way to the gravity gun found in BreakQuest.

The first version of Rogue Clone was first released in 1986 for UNIX.<br><br>At first glance, Rogue Clone is quite indistinguishable from the original: Enter some randomly generated dungeon, bash monsters, grab treasures, evade traps, and find the stairs to the next level, all this to recover that fabled Amulet of Yendor and make it back to the light of day -- alive, preferably... everything in glorious ASCII graphics.<br><br>On a second glance, one realizes that Rogue Clone features some additions and modifications to game play. For example, there are no dark rooms, and the difficulty level is slightly easier -- monsters spawn quicker, but there is much more items to be found. Another very helpful feature is that unknown items are automatically identified after use, so that next time you find them, you'll know what awaits you. The first version of Rogue Clone also omitted traps and secret doors, later versions have both, but traps may not go off if an inadvertent adventurer steps onto them. Mazes are also drawn differently, and there are other changes in the items and their characteristics.<br><br>Otherwise, this version plays pretty much like the original and earns its name.

Description=R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.<br><br>The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).<br><br>The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

Although no words are spoken and no text appears to explain their feelings, it is up to the player to decide when they talk to each other (implied) and how they react.<br><br>This is done using the motion control of the mobile device. By tilting it left or right, the player decides who is speaking or reacting, shifting the screen to close in on the character of choice.

Through this mechanic, the implied flow of the fight is decided by the player - who speaks? who's silent? - eventually leading up to a reunion or a break-up. Music and sound is also interwoven. The jazz arrangement adapts to the emotions; hi-hats building up rage, a piano chord when shifting the focus, the bass announcing tensions, brass softening the atmosphere. As such, the sound and drawn graphics are the only lead to follow the story.

Description=Sheeple is a puzzle-game in which the player needs to guide Sheep People (=Sheeple) to the star-shaped exits. Of course it's not just watching the Sheeple automatically go from A to B. Instead there are many obstacles in the way the player has to remove like crates that have to be moved out of the way, stone and ice rocks that need to be destroyed or streams that need to be crossed. To help the Sheeple, the player has a limited amount of time and tools available. He can build bridges, destroy ice rocks with a fireball and order the Sheeple to walk a little faster. The Sheeple meanwhile follow the given path and just turn around or go in another direction when they encounter an obstacle.<br><br>To further increase the difficultly in the later levels, not only multiple Sheeple need to be helped out but also the level-exits as well as the Sheeple are color-coded or the level-exit can only be used once and the other Sheeple need to find another.

Description=This release of Siberian Strike includes the whole story and features all the levels which where previously released in two parts as Siberian Strike and Siberian Strike: Episode II. The goal of the game is the destruction of the Stalin-Bot, a crossbreed of Stalin and the future MIR Space Station, who owns the vodka producing company Stalinka Corp. The company is behind a communist invasion because they produce genetically engineered vodka that completely annihilates the willpower of those who drink it.<br><br>To do the job, the player can choose between one of three pilots and airplanes at the start of the story mode. While Eliza McCampbell's R-51 Thunder is the fastest plane in the game, it's not very powerful. Pappy T. Wilder on the other hand uses the B-27 Sicarius, a slow but powerful bomber. The third pilot is Eliott Freeman with his balanced P-69 Conquest. Each plane also features four different paint-jobs which need to be unlocked first by playing through the game with that plane. In addition, additional difficulty levels become only available after killing the Stalin-Bot.<br><br>The main part of the game is a vertical-scrolling top-down-shooter. The player moves his plane around the screen in order to avoid the enemy projectiles while firing all available cannons and collecting the power-ups dropped by destroyed enemies. These include more powerful weapons as well as extra lives or a shield which makes the player immune to all damage for a few seconds. If the player destroys a group of enemies who all belong to the same squad, a medal drops. Once the player has collected 100, an additional continue becomes available after all his lives have been lost, allowing him to get right back in the game - although without all the power-ups he had upon death. Most of the levels feature one or more bosses.<br><br>In a few levels, the game switches to a third-person-perspective. Here, the player's main goal is to avoid the many obstacles in his path while the game automatically targets the automatic turrets along the route. The player just has to press a button once targeting has been completed. These levels also don't feature any power-ups.<br><br>The game features a Wi-Fi-multiplayer-mode in which two players shoot their way to the Stalin-Bot cooperatively.

Description=Sil is a puzzle game based around shape recognition and rotation.  The game's basic premise is simple - the player is first shown a silhouette of an object, then they are presented the object in the wrong position.  It is up to them to then rotate the object until it is in the same position as the silhouette.  If the player runs out of time before matching the silhouette, the game is over.<br><br>Every time the player successfully matches an object to a silhouette, they fill their time bar slightly and earn extra time.  They can also earn extra time bonuses (and points) by quickly matching an object to its silhouette.  This will earn them a 'Perfect!' bonus.  The silhouette for the same object the switches position, and if the player matches it quickly again, they'll earn a 'Double Perfect!', followed by a 'Triple Perfect!' bonus.  After this, the game will move onto the next object as normal.<br><br>At the end of each level, the player is ranked based on their speed, earning them between 0 and 3 Ranking Stars.  The player is able to earn special trophies for reaching certain milestones in the game (such as reaching particular levels, earning enough Ranking Stars, scoring certain amounts, and so on).

The controls have also been changed to be able to build the city with a touch-screen. The main difference being that something the player builds won't immediately show up on the map. Instead he can make changes to the placement like increasing the length of the road or move it around a bit before giving the final order to build. In addition the way water and electricity work has been changed a bit. In the original each house needed a connection to the pipes and pylons as long as no other house near it had one. Now the connections automatically supply a certain area around them weather or not a house has been build directly on it similar to the way roads work.

Description=Solipskier is a fast-paced action game based around skiing. The aim of the game is to get the skier as far as possible without crashing and rack up a large amount of points, but the player does not control him directly. Instead you need to draw the snow for him to ski on, with the mouse (Browser) of by touching the screen (iPhone). Downslopes allow him to speed up, but he will climb up hills as well. By drawing downslopes ending in an upwards curve, he can be launched in the air. Doing that in quick succession allows him to travel great distances at large speeds. While in the air tricks are performed automatically when the player stops painting snow. The game builds up a score while playing, and by catching air, stars are earned and multipliers are built up. It is also possible to ski through gates and long tunnels to receive additional points and gain speed. Touching red gates kills the skier instantly, however and there are parts that prevent the player from drawing snow to ski on. Indicators on the right announce gates, tunnels and hazards. The skier is designed as a white figure with headphones, blasting rock music. At very high speeds it is possible to lose the headphones, making the rushing wind the only sound.

Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. <br><br>The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends, and trapped them inside  robots.  Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. <br><br>Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. <br><br>The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. <br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."

This way they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg.  Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from taking over the world. <br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog.  Like the original, players run through different worlds called "Zones", which each have their own specific theme.  There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress.<br><br>Sonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the levels.  As with most platformers, when the player collects 100 rings, they earn an extra life.  However, the rings also act as protection - if Sonic is hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible.  If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life.<br><br>If the player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access the Special Stage.  In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint.  Complete all the checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.<br><br>New to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails.  Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play.  Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a "Spin Dash".  This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where you need some momentum.<br><br>The game also features a 2-player versus mode.  This mode is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones in the single player game.

The victory, however, is short-lived, as Eggman is up to revenge and rebuilds and improves his greatest creations for the sole purpose of destroying Sonic once and for all.<br><br>The game does not only return to the original series in terms of story and title, but also in terms of gameplay. Sonic 4 is a classical 2D sidescroller like its predecessors and also features the same game mechanics as the old games.

One major difference are the graphics, as Sonic 4 uses polygons for the Sonic characters and prerendered graphics for everything else, so does not recreate the looks of its predecessors, unlike, for example, Mega Man 9.

If the clock reaches zero on the other hand, the player advances to the next level.<br><br>Besides tapping each critter manually, the player also has access to a special attack. When he shakes the device and has at least one special mallet left, every critter and cat on the screen will be hit instantly. In addition gems and clocks pop up further increasing the points earned and available time respectively.<br><br>Besides the fields full of rabbits, the game features other scenarios like space and disco-aliens, some of which need to be bought in-game before use.

To spice things up, the hovercrafts are equipped with various weapon slots for which ammunition is scattered around the track. Ranging from machine gun fire over rockets to mines, the player has all the means to destroy his opponents or get destroyed himself. To prevent that from happening, power-ups like shields or repair-kits can also be collected by simply driving over them.<br><br>These drops also become important in the arena-mode where the driver with the most frags wins the match. During the course of the game the player unlocks up to 12 tracks, 6 distinct hovercrafts and additional weapons and power-ups.

Each level is a perimeter of space, showing planets and yellow creatures floating and asking for help. The astronaut keeps circling fast around one of the planets as if caught by its gravity field, and pressing the button at the right moment throws the spaceman towards another planet, leaving a line behind marking the trajectory. The main objective is to use the character to rescue the creatures, by connecting three lines to create a protective triangle net around them. The amount of air left is shown as meter at the top, always depleting and acting as a timer to complete the missions.<br><br>Power-ups appear randomly on the field. The red P triangle pulls the creatures to the rescue net. The yellow triangle makes the lines last longer.

After selecting a game mode (single-bout or inter-city tournament) a player is presented with the driver's seat view from atop a rickety tall bike; pedaling is simulated by stroking the sides of the screen to get up to speed, and the &quot;lance&quot; (generally padded bamboo or PVC piping) is targeted by tapping the approaching tattooed opponent (but not on their head, one of the sports' few rules.)  The game does some calculations behind the scenes following the critical moment of encounter and then employs ragdoll physics to display the outcome of the match in slow-motion.<br><br>There is an RPG element where successful players get to develop various stats which assist in retaining control of their vehicle; also, the player's tall bike may be upgraded (or repaired following damaging dismounts) between bouts.  The world circuit transports the player to such exotic cycling climes as Brooklyn, Minneapolis, Reno, New Orleans, Hong Kong and Amsterdam, and eventually they may find themselves up against World Tall Bike Joust Champion Ryan Doyle, part of the real-world Black Label freak bike mechanic crew and subject of Fountainhead Films' 2007 documentary B.I.K.E. which this game ties in to.

Description=Theseus is an electronic conversion of the Theseus and the Minotaur pencil-and-paper maze puzzle by Robert Abbott, based on the concept of logic mazes where certain limitations in movement apply.<br><br>The game consists of 85 mazes with an increasing difficulty to solve, designed by the original author, one of the early converters Toby Nelson, as well as Claude-Guy Quimper. Players need to guide Theseus (represented by a blue ball) towards the exit of the maze, while avoiding the minotaur (represented by a horned, red ball). The goal of each level is to reach the exit, but this cannot be done by travelling towards it directly. Theseus is only able to move one tile at at time, while the minotaur can do two. To reach the exit, Theseus has to outsmart the minotaur by luring him into a specific position, exploiting the internal movement logic. The minotaur will not chase after Theseus directly, but approaches him based on rules of vertical and horizontal movement. For instance, when Theseus is on the same horizontal line as the minotaur, but with a wall between them, he is able to move left and right as much as he wants without having the minotaur move. At certain moments it is also needed to delay an action or skip the turn, to lure the minotaur into a certain path without moving Theseus.<br><br>The game is entirely controlled through the touch screen and includes an automatic save function, an undo and reset button, and different hints. The game also keeps track of the amount of moves that was needed to solve the puzzle and provides an award based on the result.

Description=The sequel to Tradewinds, Tradewinds 2 shifts the geographic setting from the Far East to<br>the Caribbean Sea in the year 1700. Once again, the object of the game is select one of several different pre-generated characters and then travel to the various port cities of the region, trading and adventuring along the way.<br><br>Ports have a number of locations to visit. The Governors Mansion is the place to go to obtain important missions and then collect cash and item rewards for success. The Tavern is a good place to find information about prices and to pick up general tips on gameplay. Buy low and sell high at the Marketplace, where a number of legal and contraband goods (cotton, arms, sugar, tobacco, wine, etc.) are available. The Bank allows you to store your hard-earned gold in a safe place while earning a low rate of interest, whereas the Moneylender will let you borrow funds at a higher interest rate. Acquire the Warehouse in your home port if you want more space to store your goods. Pay the Shipwright if you want to get repairs, buy ammunition, or purchase a new ship. Not every port has every type of location, though, and you do not know what locations a port has until you have visited it.<br><br>Random sea battles against pirates will frequently occur when sailing between ports. These battles take place in real time. Selectively target enemy vessels with a variety of different ammo types (standard, chain shot, firepot, etc.) until all enemy vessels, or your vessel, has sunk. You can attempt to flee and avoid fighting, but retreat means you will not receive the treasure money that is awarded for victory at sea.<br><br>Missions send you from one port to another, and sometimes you will need to visit several ports before a mission can be completed. New ports, goods, and missions become available as your career progresses. Successful completion of a characters story unlocks a special playable character. A character-creation mode can also be unlocked for further replay.

Description=Trism is a puzzle game designed around the iPhone's ability to touch the screen and tilt it.  The screen is filled with a board of triangles (or 'Trisms'), and the player can clear away Trisms by making three or more of the same color touch.  These Trisms then disappear, and more slide on-screen.  The direction that the new Trisms slide in from is determined by the position that the player holds the iPhone.  A skilled player can use varying directions to their advantage, allowing for combos of multiple Trisms being cleared.<br><br>To complicate matters, Trisms occasionally get 'screwed in', meaning that all the Trisms on that row can no longer be moved, and instead must be cleared to restore the row back to normal.  Other Trisms may become bombs with timers on them - if the player doesn't clear these dangerous Trisms before the timer runs out, the bomb explodes and it's Game Over!<br><br>Trism has three different modes of play:<br><br>1.

The players control a cake-form which can hold six pieces. The board is shaped like a wheel and divided into squares with six of them being so-called category headquarters. The goal of the game is to land on each of those category headquarters and answer the corresponding question correctly which in turn earns the player a corresponding piece to fill up the cake-form. Once he has collected all six pieces, the player has to move back to the center of the board for the final question. If he gets the answer right, he wins the game.<br><br>To get on the category headquarters, the up to four players or bots (virtually) throw a six-sided dice. Every player can roll the dice as many times as he manages to answer the question corresponding to the category of the square he lands on after moving his cake-form. The same system is used in Pursuit-mode but instead of collecting six pieces to win, the sole goal is to get from one end of the custom-made board to the other.

While holding them over a part of the screen, a description of what they see is displayed on the bottom of the screen.<br><br>Some individuals have quirks and abilities of their own that are displayed on the villager detail screen, along with other statistics like their health and their developing skills (farming, building, research, healing and parenting).<br><br>The game advances when the members of the tribe solve puzzles, and certain milestones are reached. Randomly, a message pops up presenting a situation and offering options that affect the game in some way.<br><br>There are several activities that the villagers need to perform so that the tribe can thrive: collecting food, constructing buildings, researching new technologies, increasing the population by delivering babies, etc. Performing these activities boost the associated skill and define the villager profession. Children can't work or swim until they are 14 years old, and can only procreate when they became adults at the age of 18, but they can collect some random objects like seashells and butterflies. These objects add to the tech points used to buy technology. Advances in technology allow the villagers to perform more actions.<br><br>The game is played in real-time, and progress is saved automatically when the player exits. When the game is restarted, it calculates the time passed and adjusts the tribe situation accordingly.

To do so, the player has access to up to five different units (three land and two air) which he/she builds and upgrades in exchange for gold. Once a unit is finished, it will automatically walk from the player's base to the enemy base on a side-scrolling 2D-plane. If an enemy unit crosses its path, they'll fight until one of them is destroyed with the winner earning the same amount of gold the owner of the destroyed unit paid for it. In addition turrets are available to defend the base even when an enemy unit makes it through.<br><br>The game starts with both parties controlling cavemen and dinosaurs but over the course of the game, the era changes to Ancient Egypt, Medieval Ages, the Wild Wild West, World War II to the present day. With it, the available units and upgrades change. While at first there's a caveman with a club, in the end the player will build F14s, helicopters and armored vehicles to destroy the enemy's base.<br><br>If fighting the AI gets boring, two players can either engage in combat on the same device or through a WiFi-connection.

Description=Westward is a real-time strategy game similar to the Settlers series and the more recent Virtual Villagers. The player must build and maintain a wild west town, and perform certain tasks to progress. Some of these include finding lost treasures, gun-fighting desperadoes and blowing up obstacles with dynamite.<br><br>All the actions are performed by clicking and holding the mouse button over a character or a group of characters, and dragging a line of dots to a place or object in the terrain.  When the end of the line is over a collectable object, the cursor changes to a purse. When it is over a building with housing facilities or a job opportunity, it changes to either a house icon or an icon of shaking hands. Releasing the button makes the character follow the line path to the objective and perform the action.<br><br>Certain characters, like the Sheriff and gunslingers, have to be hired at their respective buildings, but most settlers arrive at the city spontaneously as soon as the city population limit increases.<br><br>Each citizen and building consume a fixed amount of resources like food, wood and gold. Buildings also create resources, and need employees to function. Some of the characters' status is indicated by icons floating over their heads. A food icon, for example, shows that the character is hungry.<br><br>The city is afflicted by random disasters. Cyclones damage the buildings, droughts and famine diminish productivity, and an insufficient number of outhouses can produce an outbreak of plague.<br><br>Combat follows the same interface of the other actions.

Description=Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!<br><br>In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.<br><br>Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.<br><br>Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).<br><br>Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).

Blazkowicz will meet the enemy head-on, emancipate the prisoners and bring the Axis to its knees.<br><br>Wolfenstein RPG is a first-person role-playing game that takes place in the world of Wolfenstein. The shooter's quick action has been traded in for a slowed down turn-based one where emphasis is placed on using the correct weapons or tools at the right time with the right enemies. Emphasis has also been placed on collecting treasures, finding secrets and reading books that are found along the way and that can either aid by strengthening the character or in some circumstances weakening him with the drivel written within.<br><br>The game's nine levels take Blazkowicz from prisons, to research labs, to sewers, and even to the grounds of Castle Wolfenstein. In his path there are thirty-two different kinds of enemies ranging from familiar Wolfenstein classics like guards and zombies to newly invented genetic monsters. Scientists and Engineers can help guide Blazkowicz if he manages to bribe them, but beware of loyal ones who will try to inject him with poisonous syringes. Blazkowicz' arsenal naturally includes fists and boots but he will also find machine guns, flame throwers, dynamite, rocket launchers and others that will total up to sixteen different ways of maiming Axis scum. <br><br>Besides the gold loot and books to collect as B.J. he can also find empty syringes and loose ingredients and serums that can be combined to use in specialized machines that provide special abilities like super strength, fire deterrents, and health-ups. One last important thing strewn about the world of Wolfenstein RPG are chickens. Chickens can be either roasted and turned in to health-ups or can be kicked into the same purpose. Mini-games are also available some within the game and some from the main menu. Mini-games include Chicken Kicking where the objective is to kick chickens into a targeted area to earn different points or a simple War card game where you collected gold can be bet. One addition of the iPhone version of the game is a level that involves driving.

Now you must find the words, how you combine them is your choice. Up, down, left, right, and the four diagonal ways, all are possible. Once you have found a word, the WordUp button will highlight, and so you now know that this is a valid word. When you send the word, the word will disappear and the letters used will be replaced by new random letters. Per level you must combine words worthy a certain amount of points, if you are successful, you proceed to the next level.<br><br>The game offers three different game modes: Arcade, Strategy, and Vanilla.<br><br>In Strategy, you have unlimited time for each level, while in Arcade, you are playing against the clock. The clock will be reset, when you reach the next level. If you fail to reach the necessary points in the time limit, then the game is over. To make this two game modes a bit more challenging and fun, the playfield offers Power-Ups.<br><br>The following Power-Ups are included in the game: Multipliers (2x, 3x, and 5x; will multiply the points you get from the word created, were the Multiplier was inside), Random Vowels (A, E, I, O, U, Y; the Power-Up will cycle through each of these), Random Consonants (L, M, N, R, S, T; will also cycle), Wild Tiles (works as a wildcard/joker)<br><br>These random Consonants/Vowels, and the Wild Tiles are on fixed positions in the playfield. The cycle through goes automatically, but can also be triggered per mouse click. To use them, you must be fast, since the tiles will change after a few seconds. Since only the full words counts, the Wild Tiles will work fully automatic. The Multipliers in the game working a bit different, they dont stay in place. Once you are granted a multiplier (will appear in the top horizontal row), the multiplier will then sink down, one row after a few seconds, and eventually disappear (by sinking below the bottom row).<br><br>In addition to the Power-Ups, there are also Hazards in the game. The following Hazards are included: Firecrackers (will destroy the eight direct adjacent tiles), Bombs (will destroy the 24 direct adjacent tiles), TNT (will destroy the entire playfield), and Walls (will hinder you by creating words).<br><br>Once one of the bombs has destroyed the letters, they are immediately replaced with new random letters. For the first two bomb types, if the bomb is placed on a corner, it will only destroy the adjacent tiles, even if they are not 8/24. The good thing with the bomb types is, that they will randomize the playfield, if you ignite them. The bad thing is, that they will also destroy all Power-Ups present on top of the letters.<br><br>The final game mode, Vanilla, is the same as Strategy, so all Power-Ups/Hazards described above are also present here. But it has an unique special item in it. The Swirl-Power-Up/Hazard (depending how you define it). This item will, after clicking on it, rotate all eight adjacent tiles 45° counterclockwise (one tile to the left).<br><br>After you completed the game, you have the chance to get into the highscore, but this is not just local.

The amount differs depending whether the player killed him with his fingers or a gun (which doubles the amount of stars dropped). In addition at the end of the level the player's performance and the selected difficulty level are added to the overall score. <br><br>The core of the game is the campaign mode with said 31 nights the player has to survive with increasing difficulty and different challenges as he progresses. In addition "Endless Siege" and "Sandbox" are available. While "Endless Siege" spawns endlessly new zombies until the player is overwhelmed and the house destroyed, "Sandbox" allows the player to test his abilities in a controlled environment checking out the power-ups he has and spawning zombies as he chooses.
