Description=This is an interactive movie game based on the 1996 live action movie by the same name. After Pinocchio realizes his dream of becoming a real boy, the evil Lorenzini kidnaps him and turns him back into a puppet. You must help Pinocchio's creator, Geppetto, find and rescue him.  You'll go through Pinocchio's home town, row a boat through monster-infested waters and visit Terra Magica, the fair where Lorenzini turns boys into donkeys. To succeed, you'll have to dodge deadly traps, solve puzzles and outwit Lorenzini's conniving henchmen. Sometimes, you'll have to turn yourself into a puppet, a fish, a bird or even a donkey to rescue Pinocchio.  Along the way you must collect six passwords, each reflecting a lesson in morality that Pinocchio learns. You are aided by live-action guides Lumina and Candlewick who will offer different suggestions as to what to do but you must decide.  There are plenty of wide-screen scenes from the movie and a ton of original footage. <br><br>The game comes on 4 CDs ("The Village", "The Forest", "The Sea", and "Terra Magica") because of the FMV (though the video takes up only half the screen), each disk representing another world to explore.  You must make plot choices and solve puzzles through clicking on the interface around the FMV or on the FMV itself. It allows for microphone input also through voice recognition technology that allows the user to control the events on the screen through voice alone.

Fish Shtick: Unscramble the letters before the clock reaches 0! Collect as many points as you can and get a high score! One point for four-letter words, two for 5-letter words, three for 6-letter words, etc.<br><br>3. Roof Rats: Get everyone off the roof and leave yourself with as few rooms remaining as possible. Eliminate rooms by putting two-or-more of the same colour together and double-clicking. Each person has their own number of floors that they can jump off of. The grannie has to be on ground level, the rat can jump off of 1 floor, the dog - 2 floors, the pogo-boy - 3 floors, the boxing kangaroo - 4 floors, the buff man - 5 floors.<br><br>4. Solitaire: No twists here, just a simple game of Klondike.<br><br>5. Roger Dodger: You control a glowing orb that needs to collect power-ups (green) and then make its way to the pulsing green gateway. Avoid red things; they'll kill you!<br><br>6. Zapper: Standard trivia; yes-or-no questions. Every time you get three-in-a-row correct and your time will increase, as well as the jackpot (third) point level.<br><br>7.

Every "real" word will move the scaffolding closer to you, but the clock is ticking! When it's half-past and you haven't gotten the scaffolding yet, you die!<br><br>9. Toaster Run: Ah, the little toaster that was the first in a series of infamous screen savers. Now the little toaster is on a mission to gather all the toys and put the child in bed.

Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.<br><br>Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).<br><br>Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. <br><br>Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark.

Originally a gold town set up rather rudely on ancient Indian sacred ground, Slaughter Gultch was founded by a man named Jebediah Stone and run by his own private army of cold-blooded killers. Stone and his men were killed by angry villagers led by the local Blacksmith, and the town was abandoned soon after. Unfortunately, Emily's crew disturbs the spirits of Stone and his men, who promptly return to the world of the living and proceed to kill off the film crew one by one. <br><br>Carnby is called to Slaughter Gultch after learning of the disappearance of Emily and her crew, and is soon met by Stone's Zombie Cowboy gang. Armed with various western paraphenalia such as colt peacemakers, bullwhips, and even a gattling gun, Carnby must fight his way through Stone's minions and discover Emily's fate. Along the way he learns some surprising things about Stone's origin, as well as a sinister plan interrupted by his death which involved the destruction of the west coast and which Stone can now pursue once again.

Description=ArtRageous! is a series of games and other interactive learning activities centered around art history. The learning adventure begins in a virtual plaza where the player/student can choose from a number of destinations to visit. Among the destinations are sizable, cross-referenced databases of both paintings and painter biographies.<br><br>The main attraction of Artrageous! is the rich variety of activities present. The activities cover 5 categories of understanding and appreciating art: Color, light, perspective, composition, and the life of art. The color category includes a color mixing game in which you must use varying amounts of red, blue, and yellow components to build a hue/saturation color wheel. Another activity demonstrates the effect of adjusting the brightness or contrast of a picture. These and other activities are supplemented with narrated explanations of color concepts.<br><br>The activities covering light include a sphere with lights placed around it-- click on one of the lights to understand the visual effects of different light sources. Also, a game that explains light demonstrates how outlines create shape. The player's goal is to match a number of outlines to their respective images within a mish-mash painting.<br><br>One of the perspective category games is to arrange a roomful of floating objects where they would fit more appropriately on the painting backdrop. Both the painting and the objects are drawn with a 3D perspective which gives the player clues about placement. Further, the player can elect to bring up a vanishing point line grid for help.<br><br>The composition section demonstrates how elements of paintings convey meaning. One game that illustrates this concept asks the player to match which shape or concept (circle, triangle, balanced scale, or unbalanced scale) best represents each of a selection of paintings.<br><br>The life of art category features a jigsaw puzzle game using square pieces. The player must re-assemble the puzzle in a given period of time.

Description=Battle Sat is a shareware clone of the classic Battleship board game. However, here the conflict has left the oceans and has instead gone to the skies above.<br><br>The player takes turns against the computer's AI in a race to destroy the opponent's Sats (or Satellites). Gameplay is very similar to the classic Battleship - There are three grids on the screen: The left grid shows your opponent's playfield and tells you if you've hit one of his Sats, or if you missed. The middle grid allows you to choose what area you will attack during your turn. The right grid displays your own Sats, their status, and the places where the opponent has already attacked. This continues until one side loses all their Sats.<br><br>The main difference between the Battleship board game and this Windows-based implementation is that there are five Sat pieces in play, all different sizes. While the board game has two pieces that are two blocks in size, this version contains one piece that's two blocks in size, and one piece that's one block in size.

The game shows only one perspective at the time but by using one of the three scanners the perspective shifts and it also says how many enemy ships are on he chosen axis. <br><br>Just like in Battleship he doesn't know where these ships exactly are. He has to aim his airship's gun to a certain coordinate - if he hits an enemy ship, it gets destroyed. The position also gets marked so he doesn't shoot the same field twice. The Zilog ships don't shoot back - the difficulty are the limited fuel and rocket reserves which are reduced with every movement respectively shot. There are overall three difficulty settings.

One day, a group of peasants approach the castle, and the elder tells you about a terrible death of a little girl, who was killed by a vicious wolf. Suspecting the wolf could be a supernatural creature, the peasant asks you, the Schattenjaeger, to purge the evil. The investigation brings Gabriel and his assistant Grace Nakimura to the mysterious Hunter Society and to Bavaria's dark past.<br><br>The Beast Within utilizes a cast of live actors and full-motion video technology: the actors are filmed over photorealistic images of Munich and its surroundings, and nearly every interaction with the environment leads to a FMV sequence. However, unlike most interactive movies that were popular in this era, The Beast Within is a full-fledged adventure game, with a lot of dialogues, detective work to do, and puzzles to solve.

Description=Betrayal in Antara uses an updated version of the game engine from Betrayal at Krondor. However, it does not continue the Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar saga, but instead starts a new tale set in a different fantasy world, known as Ramar.<br><br>The story begins with William Escobar, the son of the governor of Pianda, sailing home to meet his fiancee. The ship is attacked by pirates, and William escapes in a life boat with a mortally wounded traveler. Before he dies, the stranger gives William a medallion, warning him of a conspiracy against the Empire. William meets a young magician named Aren, who has just discovered devastating powers within himself, and the two decide to meet William's father and ask for his advice concerning the unsettling information.<br><br>The game plays very similarly to Betrayal at Krondor. The player navigates a party of three characters through the 3D world. Enemy encounter triggers a separate battle screen, on which player-controlled party and the enemies engage in turn-based combat. Cities are usually displayed as still pictures, with various locations accessible via menu-based navigation. Like in Betrayal at Krondor, there are only two character classes in the game, warrior and mage. The skill system is also nearly identical; skills are improved by repeatedly using them, and marking them in the skill menu for faster learning. Elements like a day/night cycle, weapon and armor repairing, navigation on world map, the necessity to carry rations, etc. are also brought over from the earlier  Dynamix game.

The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.<br><br>The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.<br><br>In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.<br><br>The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.

Description=This box contains the first ever "Command & Conquer" game with its add-on mission disc, "The Covert Operations" (though it's not the Gold edition for Windows 95 platform, it's the original DOS version).<br><br>Command & Conquer (1995) - 2 compact discs<br><br>The world has changed quite a bit from now, but the year is the present (1995 that is, when the game was released). Two global factions struggle for the ultimate control over the Earth, Global Defense Initiative (GDI) which originated out of the UN and is interested in world peace. On the other side, under the control of one madman, Kane, the Brotherhood of NOD, which exists as a terrorist organization, but with dominion over a large territory.<br><br>You have the selection of the sides, and if you choose GDI, your battles will be across Europe (most on grassy terrain, with some occasional snow). If you choose to fight for NOD, you'll do battles across Africa (mostly sandy landscapes). The balance of units is fine, but each side does not have the same type of unit to compensate equally. The GDI has fast Hum-Vee jeeps with mounted machine gun, while NOD has the Sand-Buggy with a mounted gun that is slightly less efficient. The GDI has the Orca type of vehicles armed with missiles.  It is effective against vehicles and buildings. NOD has Apache attack helicopters that have machine guns which are only effective against soldiers or cars. While NOD has only one type of tanks (which are smaller but faster than the GDI's), the GDI has two types of tanks, a medium-sized one and a Mammoth tank that also has the ability to defend from air attacks. On the other side, NOD has flame tanks and flamethrowers for the mass killing of enemy soldiers. Basically, both sides have very unique units and buildings you'll have to use different strategies and tactics in order to use them efficiently.<br><br>Fight for peace with GDI, or for a new world order with Kane. It's entirely up to you. Either way, you'll get around 13 different missions with cinematics and CG in between every single one of them.<br><br>Command & Conquer: The Covert Operations (1996) - 1 compact disc<br><br>This add-on to C&C takes the story to what would've happened if the GDI won the battle. The last thing we know is that Kane died under the ruins of his own Temple of NOD somewhere in Sarajevo, but did anyone notice his disappearance? On this mission disc, NOD forces are even more aggressive than ever. It's really for hard-boiled fans of the universe since it's far from just using the normal standard of the term 'tough'.<br><br>There are just a few new units. You can't build them in single-player missions, though in the Gold version you can produce them in multi-player. The colors of some already seen units were also changed and given to the opposing side. For example, A10-Warthog bombers changed from pink to purple and became NOD units, but only when you're playing as GDI. As far as the completely new units go, NOD got poison gas throwers, which are similar to flamethrower infantry, but they can also walk over Tiberium unharmed. They also got rocket trucks with two surface-to-surface missiles attached on each, but with a long range. Some minor changes were also made on the terrain, such as adding houses that weren't shown in the original. Also, 8 new tracks were added to the soundtrack.

And most importantly -- how to survive and get hold of the precious diamond and, perhaps, save the unfortunate souls of the first expedition in the process.<br><br>The gameplay is that of a classical inventory-based adventure. Although occasionally the game does depart from the formula. It mostly concerns the sequences where player should operate a multi-functional device resembling a laptop. With it's use player is able to analyze visual images to gain clues, record audio, track homing signals on the map and examine additional info from the  files downloaded from the TraviCom network. Other notable gameplay features include navigating a river by boat and a maze-like sequence in the middle of the game.<br><br>Visually the game is similar to the first-person adventure games of it's era tracing its roots to Myst. It contains the same pre-rendered 3D backgrounds with the smoothly animated transition sequences and the characters done in live-action, except for Amy who is also executed in pre-rendered 3D. <br><br>The game is supplied with the trailer of the afore-mentioned 1995 movie.

Description=An historical adventure game set in the Middle Ages at the time that the Franks were beginning to be driven out of Jerusalem. The player follows the adventure of Artaud, a disgraceful French Lord, who is sent to redeem himself by traveling to the Holy Lands to escort the True Cross back to safety. This is done through a series of scenes, with narration. The player has to complete certain tasks before Artaud can progress to the next scene. These tasks are generally of an educational nature, such as learning how sieges on castles were carried out, or who the main forces in the Holy Lands were at the time. Whilst Artaud's quest is fictional (with some added supernatural events), the setting is quite real, with actual locations visited and use of historic figures.<br><br>Artaud's quest will see his home in Dun-le-Roy wasted in a siege, travel across the Mediterranean to the port of Acre, and eventually to the Holy City of Jerusalem.

Intertwined with the scenes is an encyclopaedia, which it is necessary to interact with in order to complete the tasks and fully understand the narrative. The structure of most of the tasks involves collecting items from the scenes and the encyclopaedia by dragging them into your inventory, and then re-arranging them on to the task screen. The game is very similar in style to 1998's Vikings.

Description=Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks.  They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!<br><br>Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him.  Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid.  Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him.  Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map.  In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited.  Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.<br><br>Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision.  Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death.  (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)<br><br>Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon.  Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.

Wandering the streets of his dream world, his has to pick up and put to use things that would not normally be used in adventure games of its time, like dirty underwear or sewage. But don't think this is a gross or childish game. While it isn't tremendously challenging or diverse (the play control is very similar to that of Myst), it is still very original. And as Tyler discovers something terribly wrong with the state of his dreams, he must also find a way to escape, which is only half the fun.

Description=This early, authorized freeware remake of the puzzle game from 1987 updates the graphics and sounds while maintaining the original gameplay. Each level is a puzzle room filled with obstacles and viewed from above, where the objective is to use a series of mirrors to guide a laser beam towards a receiver device and complete the stage. The mirrors are stationary, but can be rotated to deflect the light to several directions, with some turning automatically all the time. The player must configure the mirrors and carefully avoid the mines and walls that reflect the laser back to itself, causing the emitting device to overload and explode. Bomb detonators have to be activated and destroyed to open a passage to the receiver. Other features change the behavior of the laser: the prism bends the light in random 90º angles; the optical fiber nodes act as a portals, transporting the beam to another place of the board; logical doors have internal mirrors that absorb or deflect the laser when hit at the correct orientation. This remake received a new version in 2006.

Before leaving the newbie area to enter the game, you will have to choose a nationality to determine your start location and native tongue.  There are a number of chat channels for individuals and clubs. Player versus Player interaction is on an opt-in basis. <br><br>Each character can join one of the guilds where you will have some unique abilities not available to others. Some common attributes like hit points, perceptiveness, and swimming skill are the same for everyone but divine magic for priests or the 'backstab' command for covert-based guilds are limited to guilds.  There's six main classes - wizard, priest, witch, warrior, thief, and assassin with the last 3 being split into several sub-guilds.<br><br>The game mechanics are based on a semi-permanent stats dealing with your essential nature and skills relating to your aptitude in performing certain tasks which can be increased by spending experience points to learn yourself or from other  players/NPCs.  Levels are uncapped, but rise in cost of experience points per level.  To gain these experience points, you can  defeat NPCs in combat, use guild points (categorised action points), explore areas, solve puzzle-like quests, accomplish in-game achievements, or just being online will very slowly give you some.<br><br>Characters start with seven lives, which can be replaced in-game, but if all are lost you cannot be revived.

The dog needs to be fed and you can play with them, scold them, and teach them tricks. It is also possible to take pictures and design a playpen for them. In other applications the dog can grab your attention by holding on to the cursor, or you can throw a ball to keep it busy while doing something else.<br><br>When the dog is not fed or cared for, for a long time, it dies. This concept was also used as a business incentive. The game was distributed freely, but only came with five days of food. Because without food the dog would die in the demo version, this encouraged players to pay the $20 to get the full game and an unlimited amount of food.

Description=Dr. Drago's Madcap Chase (a.k.a. Die total verrückte Rallye)  is a strategy game for up to eight players with similarities to board games like Monopoly. <br><br>The players join a rally through Europe and North Africa which consists of several stages. At the beginning of each stage a TV moderator names the capital of a country. The one who gets there first will win a lot of money. At first there are only Western European countries available but eventually the Berlin Wall falls and you can enter the former Eastern bloc.<br><br>You play on a map of Europe consisting of many fields merged with each other through lines. Before every turn a player dices and then he can move his figure over the fields. You can freely decide the route to your target but you have to notice on which field you would end your turn. There are:<br><br>1. Red fields: When you end your turn on a red field, you'll lose money.<br><br>2. Blue fields: Money will be credited to your account.<br><br>3. Yellow fields: You get a playing card. You can use these cards before every turn to your own advantage (i.e. use five dices instead of one) or to your opponent's disadvantage (i.e. having him transferred to a corner of the map).<br><br>4. Purple fields: On a purple field you can buy or sell cards.<br><br>5. Gray fields: Gray fields are cities. In a city you can buy buildings and earn rent every turn. When you own every building in a city, you have a monopoly and earn more rent. Contrary to Monopoly you don't have to pay anything when you come to a city where one of the other players have buildings.<br><br>6. Black and white fields: These fields represent the capital of a country. Buying buildings there is much more expensive but you will earn more rent.<br><br>Another aspect of the game is Dr. Drago. Drago is played by the computer and appears after stage one and will follow the player who had the highest distance to the target of the previous stage. After every turn Drago will waste parts of your money, sell or buy buildings to terrible prices or destroy your cards. To get rid of him you can use a Drago playing card (if you own one and Drago has not ripped it to pieces yet) or overtake one of the players. When you pass them, Drago will leave you and chase your opponent. <br><br>The winner of the game is the one who has the most money on his account after all stages. You could even win without winning a single stage but it's more difficult because you won't make that much profit with trying to end your turns on blue fields. And of course, Drago will haunt you the whole time when you are cruising in Northern Africa while all the stages end somewhere else.

Description=An updated version of White Wolf's earlier Empire game, which was based on a wargame dating back to early mainframe days.  One to six players (human or computer with three levels of intelligence) compete to conquer the world using their ground, air, and sea units.<br><br>There are three versions of the game available:  basic, standard, and advanced.  The basic game provides the minimal types of units, a completely viewable map, and basic production rules.  The standard game adds some new units, forces you to explore the map to view it, and slightly modifies the production rules.  Finally, the advanced game (for the true wargamer) adds even more types of units, terrain effects on movement and sighting, and slightly more complicated production rules.<br><br>In addition to playing one or more people around the same computer, you could play via mail (by posting disks back and forth), e-mail, modem, network, or direct serial link.<br><br>The game also came with some preset scenarios and maps for players to use.  Additionally, there was an editor that let players create their own maps and scenarios.<br><br>Copy protection was a  compromise between security and player convenience.  Rather than looking up a word in the manual every time the game was run, this was only required when running the separate executable that set game options.  (Screen resolution, sound options, etc.)  Naturally, you always had to run it before playing the first time.<br><br>White Wolf and New World Computing also released a scenario disk for the game and later  released the Windows version with the extra scenarios on CD-ROM.

Description=Fantastic Fossils II was an educational game released as shareware in 1993. Much like the first FF, it had an all-ages theme. The educational aspect offered much information and depth, and the games were used to reinforce the material. It had fossil and bone guessing puzzles, a dinosaur bone matching game, and a classification game. It also had a very detailed "fossil dig" game much like the first, where you could excavate and preserve your findings like real archaeologists. The Fossil Gallery in Fantastic Fossils II contained hundreds of fully cataloged fossil images in 8 bit color, and had a synthesized audio pronunciator that would say the names of each fossil you were looking at.

Description=This collection is a set of four "retro games" based on fondly remembered titles from the 1980's. <br><br>BOT<br>Your mission is to prevent the Mother CPU from completing its military conquest of the planet. To succeed you'll need to pass through 5 levels of BOT soldiers shooting them at will, including a larger BOT boss at the end of every level. Try to pick up extra grenades, armor protection, and more powerful weaponry along the way to assist you in accomplishing this task. Finding the experimental lightning gun is especially helpful, since it inflicts twice as much damage on enemies as your normal gun.<br><br>BUBBLE TROUBLE<br>You control a spaceship which you must use to clear the starlanes of subspace vortices (which look like terrestrial water bubbles). You must avoid contact with these vortices and shots by your own weapons, or your energy will slowly drain away. Your ship is armed with two weapons: guns, which are weak but use up little energy; and penetrators, which are strong but use up much more energy. Ship energy is used for thrusting, subspace jumping, and conducting repairs. Shields are used for defense only, and you lose shield power when you come in contact with vortices, bullets, penetrators, saucers, or stationary energy barbs.<br><br>FLAK ATTACK<br>A horde of robot commandos are attacking your base from the skies above. You control a single gun which you must aim and fire to stop the invaders, but don't run out of ammunition, or your base will certainly be destroyed. When a robot parachutes to the ground, it will walk towards your base and stand beside it.  When 4 robots gather on one side of the base, they will destroy it, and the game will be over.<br>The enemy ships include satellites, jets, and helicopters.  Satellites fly past at high speeds, but they cannot harm your base directly. Jets fly overhead quickly, and the pilot will eject if you fire enough shots at it. Helicopters drop parachuting robots as they pass. Friendly UN Helicopters will drop extra ammo on your base if you let them fly peacefully overhead. <br><br>MOLE'S QUEST<br>As Monty the Mole, you must rescue your belongings which the miners have scattered throughout the mines after they destroyed your beautiful home. Jump from platform to platform from the left to the right, grab the belonging, and jump back to the left to safely pass each level. Each time you save ten belongings, you will see an animation of Monty taking the rescued belongings to his new home. Since the mines are covered with radioactive ooze, you must limit your exposure to no more than 5 minutes at a time. That should be sufficient time to rescue each of your belongings. Every time you save a belonging, you will be given a password, so you can continue from the level where you stopped, even if you shut off your computer.

Your final goal is to form up a row of the same type of fruits on the bottom of the game field, once you done this, these fruits will disappear, and the fruits that maybe on top of these, will fall further down.<br><br>How many similar fruits you need for this depends on the option you have set before you started. On default it's three fruits, maximal is eight fruits (from eight possible squares). You do not need to arrange them horizontal, you can also arrange them vertical or diagonal. Once this row vanishes, you get your points. If you reach a certain amount of points, you proceed to the next level, were this all gets faster. All in all, there are 9 levels in total.<br><br>The fruits you play with are the following: Cherry, Strawberry, Watermelon, Apple, Grapefruit, and Plum. In addition, there are some kind of red "stars", these are falling only in a row without fruits, once they hit the fruits, some of them gets destroyed and you earn points.<br><br>And in addition to the fruit-based-column-game, there is a plain square-based-column-game included, which can be activated (or deactivated) from the options.

After the war ended, Bions started their own war against Humanity... And humanity managed to win again, but Earth was decimated in the process. We thought we had destroyed all the Bions, but apparently we are wrong. A few Bions have survived... and they are rebuilding on the planet named Fury... As a councillor in Council of Peace, the premier peacekeeping force, you will take the advanced fighter and repel the Bion invasion, and eventually destroy the Bion threat once and for all. <br><br>Fury³ is basically a Windows adaptation of Terminal Velocity where you pilot a super fighter and kill bazillion targets from first person (default) or third-person viewpoints. The action is fast and furious, with plenty of air and ground threats plus structures to shoot. <br><br>The fighter sequences are interspersed with a bit of tunnel running (inspired by Descent, no doubt) and a lot of shooting. Shoot the weapon pods to release missiles and other goodies which you can use to supplement your own ship. <br><br>The game is in full 3D without the need for a 3D video accelerator, though it only supports 320x200 resolution and preferably 256 color only.

On arcade mode you have the usual 3-stage power bar for your swing. While on simulation mode you just click whenever you want the ball to go and your golfer swings. The trick is on simulation mode: 40 editable statistics are taken into account for the accuracy, power, etc of the swing. So depending on how you have customized your golfer you'll have a good long-range game, but be weak in the wet, etc..<br><br>Graphics consist of mostly digitized photo-realistic images.

The game offers all the excitement of a real poker game mixed with Sierra's unique brand of humour.<br><br>The game offers a total of 20 variations on popular poker games including: Texas Hold 'Em, Omaha, Omaha Hi/Lo, High Chicago, Cincinnati, Baseball, 5 Card Stud, 7 Card Stud, 7 Card Stud Hi/Lo, Jacks or Better, Criss Cross, Dealers Choice, 5 Card Draw and 5 Card Draw Lo-ball.<br><br>In single-player offline mode, you can select up to 7 opponents to play against, each with their own personality, playing style and skill level.  The animated AI characters are well done and if you study them carefully, you can figure out each player's tell, which gives away the fact that they have a good hand.  The Attitude Meter adjusts the speed of the game; setting it higher results in more animation and comments from the AI players, whereas setting it lower, keeps them quiet and offers a faster pace game.  You start with a bankroll of $1,000 in case with another $9,000 in your bank account which you can access via an ATM (it also has a personality of it's own).<br><br>Once you've mastered the game (or become tired of the AI players),  check out the on-line play mode and see how your skills match up with real players from around the world.

The Chinese Checkers puzzle in Shivers rivals many of the ones contained in Jewels of the Oracle.  <br><br>Since there is no real story line or deeper meaning behind all this, Jewels is not an adventure game but rather a collection of challenging puzzles.

Description=Borrowing certain gameplay conventions from Qix, JezzBall presents another scenario forcing the player to divide and conquer a 2D playfield by whittling away slivers of it until it is at only 25% (or less) of its original size.<br><br>The complicating factor here are balls, more with every level, bouncing off the edges of the continuous playfield and, incidentally, quite lethal to the player's marker, only tangible while in the act of diminishing the playfield by marking off areas no longer to be used.  The player can choose to trim horizontal or vertical segments -- depending on which axis they expect the bouncing ball to intercept soonest -- and the boring apparatus used fires off in opposite directions simultaneously, meaning the cross-section generally starts being cut from the middle and works its way toward the outside edges... all while keeping an eye on how close those balls are bouncing.<br><br>The apparatus is slow, and until the entire cross-section is completed, its entire span is at risk of being hit.  The two sides of the dividing sweep are independent from each other, so if one side is intercepted by a ball while in the process of trimming, the other side continues unabated, resulting in a half-complete division.<br><br>This game became famous after being distributed as part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4 of Windows 3.x games, returning in the Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack.

Description=Jump Raven is the second title released by Cyberflix. The game is set in New York in an undefined period in the 21st century. All wildlife appears to be extinct as man has scorched the entire earth with war. Before it was too late, all animals' genetic code has been stored in biodiversity pods to bring them back safely when the ecosystem has recovered. However, a gang steals the pods and the Environmental Security Agency (ESA) brings in bounty hunter Raven to return them and preserve the animals' future.<br><br>Building on the technology of Lunicus, in Jump Raven the character Raven uses a hovercraft to move around the city. The game starts in a command center where the player can read up on the events that led to the global disaster, outfit the vehicle with different types of weapons, and interview candidates for the position of co-pilot in the hovercraft (Nikki, Chablis, Limbaugh, Thrash, Lark or Dogstar). Their in-game comments bring a different atmosphere to the gameplay.<br><br>While flying, there are three boroughs to search for pods: The Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The hovercraft can be moved around, it can switch between a hover and a fly mode, and players need to aim and fire weapons. As that is too much for the player to handle, tasks can be delegated to the AI co-pilot. When the pods have been found, a boss character guarding the exit needs to be taken out.<br><br>While playing, the game area takes up only half of the screen. The rest is reserved for incoming video messages (including taunting opponents), general options, weapon selection, a radar, a compass, and basic statistics about ammo, fuel, shields, the pods and cash. While searching the cities, targets such as jets, sleds, helicopters, tanks and armoured cars need to be engaged. When low on fuel, shield power or weapons, the fuel truck, weapons lady (in a helicopter) and the repair bay can be visited.

He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it.  Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides.  Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.<br><br>King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface.  Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands.  To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag.  By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area.  Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at".  The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects.  The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too).  Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors.  Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag.  By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has.  In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.<br><br>As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die.  Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise.  The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.

Description=For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.<br><br>For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like its predecessor, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface. The CD-ROM version of the game includes both DOS and Windows versions, full speech, a 50-meg introduction, and the Girl in the Tower theme song.

Description=This game allows children to explore Humongous versions of the South American, African and Southeast Asian jungles, and learn about some of the animal and plant life there. Like "The Airport" and "The Farm" titles, this game features Buzzy the Knowledge Bug as a guide. He reads aloud questions, answers, and the names of objects. In addition, he provides tips and suggestions and points out interesting facts. <br><br>Kids can explore the three environments, each of which has quite a few locations, where they can click on things for fun animations or instead ask "What Is This?" and go to a micro-encyclopedia for each item which describes the item and shows where they are from. The 210-item encyclopedia also has an index, so kids can jump right to items - clicking on the picture on the page will take you a place where that bug, bird, plant, or animal can be found. The encyclopedia has text, but will also read to the child if they wish - you can have it read each word by just holding the cursor over the word too. The pages also have colored hyper-linked words that are topics of other pages in the encyclopedia.<br><br>The game also has 5 mini-games, such as Trivia or Find It (shown game-related images and then have to go find them), or a 15-page coloring book (which can be printed out and has mixable colors) and Jungle Jumble (spelling/unscramble game). The Anteater Feeder mini-game is just for fun, an 100-level arcade version of the old carnival shooting game except the weapon is an anteater's tongue and you eat bugs. These games have difficulty settings, to make things harder or easier.

Description=In the early '90s, the general public had been fed a great deal of propaganda about the fierceness of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, one of the top fighting forces in the world -- though, as it turns out, one with a glaring vulnerability to air power.  In their successful attempt to oust the Iraqi army from Kuwait (being careful to leave Saddam in power) through an overwhelming display of power, the coalition of the West in operation Desert Storm soon found their grizzled opponents only too eager to surrender and save their hides.  This program commemorates their efforts, indicating a line of happily compliant soldiers, alive, in mental contrast to the stilled parade of "crispy critters" along the turkey shoot of the Highway of Death back to Basra.<br><br>To drive home the point of what a straw man the opposing forces ended up being, the program runs through to completion upon execution without any input needed from the player; however, if the author was more prescient, he might have instructed the program to lie dormant for twelve years and then fire up some horrifying no-win program like Forbidden.exe or Punishment for what John McCain suggests might be ten thousand years.

In 2000, it became a popular part of the Yahoo Games web portal playable in a JAVA format in a web browser.  <br><br>Similar to Scrabble, the gameplay involves placing letters from 7 tiles per player on a board and trying to accumulate the highest score possible.  Letters are distributed to players randomly and are worth between 1 and 5 points while blank tiles (one which is always given in first 7 tiles of the game) have no point value but can be made into any letter.  The first word must be placed horizontally or vertically with one tile on the center square.  Subsequent words must use one letter of an existing word or be placed next to one so that any touching letters form valid words also.  Knowing the valid 2-letter words is very helpful in doing this.  Placing tiles on letter and word multiplier squares will increase your score and if you place all 7 tiles on the board at once, a 35-point bonus is given.  A player can also choose to pass and select any of the letters in their pile to trade for new ones but loses their turn.<br><br>At player first creates a table and can change its options for number of players, put a time limit and whether it is unrated or rated (the outcome will affect a person's overall rating).  A challenge mode can also be set so that any word placed on the board can be challenged as to its validity by an opponent.  If it is invalid the word is removed and the player who put it down loses their turn or else the challenger loses their next turn if the word is indeed valid.  Other players choose to Join a table and press Start to begin a game.<br><br>When all tiles in the game are distributed and one player places all their remaining ones on the board or no-one can play any more tiles then the game is over.  The sum of the letter values in each player's hand is subtracted from their score. If a player has no letters remaining, the sum of all of the letter values in the other players' hands are added to their score. The person with the highest score wins.

Description=Adapted from the venerable British quiz show, Mastermind allows you to become a contestant on that program, competing against up to three others. You face two rounds of questions; the first round will see you answering a set of questions based on specialized field of your choice, while in the second round you must answer a set of general knowledge questions. Both rounds have a time limit of 2 minutes. Any question may be passed (skipped), so that you may answer more questions in the allotted time.<br><br>The person who gets the most questions right wins the contest. If a tie occurs, the person with the most passes is the loser in the contest. If a tie occurs between two players with an equal number of passes, the contestants must answer a set of five questions - all five questions being the same between contestants - as a tie breaker.<br><br>The host of the Mastermind game is (the now-late) Magnus Magnusson, who also hosted the real life Mastermind program for its entire first run from 1972 to 1997. If you run out of time in a round while he is posing a question to you, he'll state Masterminds &quot;I've started so I'll finish,&quot; catchphrase that he coined during the course of the program, finishing up the question and allowing you to answer it.<br><br>Mastermind sports over 5,000 questions to answer, and has 50 groups of specialized questions.

Description=In the castle of infinity live the eccentric masters of the elements who control time, gravity, electricity, warmth, light and chance. When the Master of Chance loses his cat, the balance of the elements is disturbed as all the other masters have gone to search for the pet. It is up to you to restore the natural order of things and collect the missing pages of the Garden of Chance book. When you solve a puzzle and find a new page, the Master of Chance appears and tells you a story with clues that lead to the missing cat.<br><br>In this game, for ages 8 to 102, each chapter of the storybook can be played in any order. The different rooms are related to the natural elements and teach a very limited amount of physics and science through the games and puzzles. Your progress in the game is shown through a number of clover leaves. You can pick up things, but there is no inventory, as all items have to be used in the screen they were found. When all the missing pages have been discovered, you can enter the Garden of Chance to retrieve the missing cat.

Description=Blasternaut, Galactic Commander, and Spot, are out searching space for The Lost City in their violet magenta cruiser. Galactic Commander feels this mission so important that she has left her normal duties at the base and joined the crew. Blasternaut and spot, however, are less than thrilled with the seemingly fruitless search.<br><br>Suddenly, Doctor Minus, a deep voiced robot with an obsession for subtraction, is behind them and shoots their ship down onto a barren planet where to their, if not the player's, surprise they find The Lost City. Despite this happy coincidence Doctor Minus is preparing an bombardment force and sending his "negatron" minions to the planet to make sure the Blaster crew doesn't get away. Galactic Commander knows more than she is letting on and is convinced that if they can restore power to buildings of the city they'll have an edge...<br><br>The game includes 4 levels, all involving math or logic problems to solve. Which you have to complete to restore the power within each building (level). <br><br>These levels include:<br><br>1. Maze Craze: Here the player will control the Math Blaster crew to collect all the numbers and operations to make a complete equation and clear the area. The player has to switch between the characters to open certain doors, or perform certain actions; for example, only Galactic Commander is tall and strong enough to pull ceiling chains.<br>2. Creature Creator: The player will start with one creature composed of a number of interchangeable parts in a bow arrows will then lead to a contiguous box the number of arrows indicates how many parts need to change. The player will then need to make more changes for the next box until there are no more, this will be the final mutation.<br>3. Position Splash: Negatrons, formless yellow critters, carrying numbers will enter from the top of the screen  an equation with a missing number will be at the bottom. However not all the negatrons are carrying the right number. So those without the correct number must be eliminated. The player controls one of the three crew members and can run left and right while throwing some sort of water grenade. Negatrons that have been hit will wander the stage and throw poisoned blobs at the active crew member, should he be hit another will take his place. This area ends when five problems have been completed, or answered incorrectly, or if all three crew members are hit.<br>4. Number Hunt: Here the player needs to find equations that equal a number between a range given at the top of the screen. Naturally these equations are on giant slabs all over the screen. A crew member will have to jump to and select the correct ones. Player beware! Many of the blocks can move back into the wall from which they jut sending the crew member out of commission.  This area is over when five correct answers or five incorrect answers are selected, or all the crew members drop.<br><br>Upon completion players will be treated to a detailed view of the true powers of the city, and as with many edutainment titles, a print out certificate with the players score.

Furthermore, Hagabelle has ripped up the spell paper and hidden it all around the castle; to reverse the spell, Max has to find all these pieces and put them together.<br><br>Before playing, the player is asked to indicate which language he speaks: English, German, French or Spanish, and to select a magic hat to keep track of his game. This serves as a save-game, allowing the player to return to wherever he left off by clicking on the same hat. The spell pieces will be hidden in different spots if the game is re-started with a new hat selected. <br><br>The player uses the mouse to point and click on items throughout the castle, most of which animate or lead to other parts of the castle. On the first run-through, he is given a thumbs-up or thumbs-down choice about moving on to the next area, and once all the scenes have been visited, he can click on the Max icon at the bottom of the screen to re-visit them. Also on first playing, each new area brings up a small text box which is read aloud by a narrator. Aside from finding the spell pieces, the player will come across some mini-games, including &quot;Catch the Rabbit&quot;, where the player must click on all the rabbits jumping out of hats, and &quot;Broomstick&quot;, where the player has the opportunity to pick from a trunkful of magic brooms and fly around the room.

During this turmoil,  Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and successfully strike the enemy.<br><br>Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost.  The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs.  At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.

Description=On the one hand, Ms. Metaverse is an interactive, futuristic and rather tacky beauty pageant. On the other hand, it's an interesting multimedia plug for developer Virtual Vegas' casino website, VirtualVegas.com.<br><br>As a judge for the futures biggest beauty pageant, the Ms. Metaverse contest, you decide which of ten sassy ladies wins the crown. The contestants, real-life girls filmed and digitized, introduce themselves in full motion video clips; you pick five from the pool and go on judging them in the categories looks, brains and talent. While moving between the judging pavilions in colorful rendered video sequences, you earn money by shooting the contestants  their artificial stupidity programs could do irreparable damage to Virtual Vegas if allowed to wander around unchecked, explains the manual. Understood.<br><br>While the Looks contest seems to be a sorry excuse to stare at pics of scantily clad women (theres no nudity in Ms. Metaverse), it also serves to identify males and / or cyborgs which might have slipped into the contest. The Brains and Talent contests display coarse videos of the contestants dancing or performing awkward sketches with Ms. Metaverse host Monty Megabyte (Chris Bonno). Watching these performances costs money, which you earn by shooting girls (see above) or playing a simple slot machine. After youve reviewed all the ladies, you may crown one Ms. Metaverse.<br><br>Ms. Metaverse offers content downloads via the included Mosaic Direct Browser  see trivia section for a detailed description.

Description=Heartfelt, but rather unrealistic wishes like ruling the world, unlimited processing power or an evening playing poker with three celebrities usually fall into the sphere of competence of a fairy. In case one happens to show up in your home: dont ask for that poker game. Thats already been taken care of, thanks to New World Computing. NWC-mastermind Jon Van Caneghem invited three class B TV celebrities of the mid-90s for a day of green-screen filming. The result is called Multimedia Celebrity Poker.<br><br>If youre into TV series, then youll probably have no trouble recognizing the faces of your opponents. Sitting at the poker table are Jonathan Riker Frakes (Star Trek: Next Generation), appearing somewhat tight-lipped; talkative comedian Joe Piscopo (Saturday Night Live), showing off his array of impersonations; and aging starlet Morgan Fairchild (Hotel, Falcon Crest), sitting stiff and generally trying not to look too lost. Digitized video clips, seamlessly integrated into the main frame, depict all actions and movements of the stars -- dealing, calling, playing cards. Separate clips for the three actors are played simultaneously to avoid freezing of single persons; all are continuously in motion. The celebrities comment on the their cards and your success to create a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. The number of different statements is quite limited though; prepare to learn those one-liners by heart.<br><br>Multimedia Celebrity Poker knows eight different variants of poker. You may play combinations of five cards or seven, stud or draw, lo-ball or high, deuces wild or normal. In any case, its always you against the computer; a multiplayer option is not included. In addition to a relaxed round among friends, you can choose to advance levels in a tournament. You win if all opponents are broke, although nobody will undress at that point. Luckily. The programs poker skill is mediocre; its playing fairly straight, rarely risking a bluff. The playing style of the three celebrities does not differ.<br><br>Ready to join the game? On second thought, maybe you should wait for the fairy.

Your mission: To safely bring Nelda to the snack bar.<br><br>The game consists of eleven colourful levels -- the different lessons --, where Nelda will have to find out about what's going on and how to solve it. She has several means to achieve this: She can walk and jump, spit "flaming custard", climb things, hunker down and "ponder a greezbock" (which does absolutely nothing). The lessons contain various nondescript fast flying or gently bobbing objects (like the much-feared Elasticow or the Blue Plate Geelynob), switches and buttons to be pressed, everything often mutating or exploding when touching the floor, spat custard at, kicked or banged with the head (it may seem as if the game was made to check out every feature Click & Create has to offer!). <br><br>The lessons start out easy, but get challenging fast; they all have a unique way of solving them and offer a great variety, from all-out shooting orgies to careful observation and deduction of the object's behaviour and well-timed jumping. What keeps the game together is the vital need to find out what each object does to complete it, as the objects' behaviour often change with every new lesson.<br><br>After completing each level, Nelda has the choice to get some bonus points by hitting the right objects (she may also lose some by hitting the wrong ones) before being presented some completely senseless trivia question à la "What have we learned in this lesson?" and moving on to the next lesson.

However, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. With each eaten mouse, Paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. You must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. Another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. Keep in mind that Paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. The same happens when Paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. This means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game.<br><br>You are awarded points for eating mice and bonus points when you beat a level, given that the bonus timer has not run out yet. The faster you clear a level, the more bonus points you earn, which are multiplied by the level number. When Paulie runs out of lives, your game is over. If you got a high score, you can enter your name in the top five.<br><br>The python can either be controlled by the arrow keys or by the mouse. For clearing a level of all mice, you either go to the next level in the given order or a random level is chosen, depending on the settings. It is also possible to freely choose a level. Furthermore, you can adjust the difficulty by selecting between five different levels of speed.

The bulk of the ARG is played across hundreds of proprietary websites each presented as "real", deliberately crafted to be indistinguishable from real-life websites and bona fide companies, bar hints such as the textual content of a site.

The interaction begins in the library as you start Simon's adventure.<br><br>This is a first person, point and click game with a somewhat unconventional interface. The inventory contains objects which can be used as well as clicked on during conversations. Icons of the people Simon has met or heard about also act as conversation topics when clicked on. The game features an in-game hint system which provides very vague clues to the many puzzles Simon will encounter. A comprehensive encyclopedia is accessible at any time to document and elaborate upon the historical facts of the era and to the game itself. <br><br>Angels, demons and people from all walks of life will help (or hinder) Simon's progress towards his goals as he travels around France's towns and countryside. Locations are varied with marketplaces, villages, a ruined fortress, gothic churches and, later, fanciful environments. Puzzles include several mechanical problems, helping other characters with objects and information as well as creative environment manipulation.

Description=Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.<br><br>Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.<br><br>Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

"Word Hunt!" is the device in puzzle books where you find words in letter grids.<br>In "Guess It!", you use logic to figure out which fruits are used and which locations they've been placed in. "Lines & Boxes"  is another logic game, making boxes by drawing lines between a grid of dots.Finally, Tangrams is a spatial recognition game, fitting pieces into different shapes. <br><br>Most of these games have multiple difficulty levels. Although designed for children 3-8, many of the games should give even parents the occasional run-for-the-money at the Hardest level.<br><br>Finally, there are four games just for fun:<br>In "Circus Stormin'" - a side-scrolling arcade game - you control Putt-Putt up and down, moving him around obstacles and having him pick up balloons. There's also a sliding tiles (logic puzzle) game with slightly varying images, and a Pachinko pinball where you can create your own 'field' of 6x11 bumpers and the balls make amusing sounds when they hit. There's also a 35-page in-game coloring coloring book with 16 mixable palette slots.

It also has a level builder for hours of balloon popping fun.

Triumph against all these odds and you get 29 more levels of similar gameplay!<br><br>This unremarkable clone is largely known on account of having been included in the original Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows.

Description=Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.<br><br>As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. <br><br>If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. <br><br>There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). <br><br>Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. <br><br>Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. <br><br>How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.

Description=Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.<br><br>As you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.<br><br>There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.<br><br>Combat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.<br><br>There are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.

Description=Made by Maxis, the company famous for its line of "Sim" games, SimPark deals with the simulation and management of a real wildlife park.  <br><br>SimPark allows you to build and manage parks from scratch, completely isolated from civilization.  You have the choice of choosing from hundreds of different species of flowers, bushes, plants, mammals, birds, and reptiles to live and thrive in your park.  Which plants and animals to put in is completely your choice, but you have to make sure that their biological needs are met so that they won't die.  You start out with a bare patch of land, but as you add plants and animals, it will begin to grow.  Depending on the climate and food available, certain animals will even begin migrating to your park.  <br><br>SimPark contains a massive database of plants and animals that you need to use in order for your park to flourish.  Over hundreds of species are cataloged in SimPark, and each article includes a brief bio, their scientific name, their wants and needs, and even an authentic recording of what each animal sounds like.  You need to utilize this information to figure out what plants and animals to put in your park, in order for the creatures to flourish.  If a creature or plant does not get enough food, a plant does not like the climate, or trees do not get the amount of water they need, your park will not grow.<br><br>When plants and animals are placed incorrectly, the park becomes unstable.  Weeds and animals will begin to overpopulate the park.  Other trees will die or get overeaten by rampaging species.  Because of this, the game tries to teach the concept of a "balanced ecosystem."  It is up to you to have an understanding of the animals in your park to preserve a balance.  Only through a perfectly balanced biological system can all of the creatures flourish.<br><br>Besides the biological aspect, there is also the managerial aspect of it.  Above all, it is up to you to manage the budget for the park.  Planting trees and adapting animals costs money, and if you can't manage that money, you're fired.  Even though you get federal funding each year, it is also important to attract visitors to the park to make a little income.  You need to make provisions for humans, like paths and bathrooms.  You also have to make sure visitors behave and do not litter or ravage the park.  Besides this, you also have the duty to identify species in your park, through a mini-game which has you identify them through their characteristics.  As well, you may  have to decide on other things like if you want to receive donations, or cater to boyscout parties (which might have negative affects on the ecosystem).<br><br>Like any classic Sim game, you can ravage your own park with disasters.  You can simulate a garbage dump disaster (a large pile of garbage and lots of rats), a fire, an alien invasion (pink and blue blobs that create garbage) and a kudzu infestation.

Description=SimTown is one of several entries in the city-building simulation series, SimCity. As in prior installments, players are tasked as the mayor of a newly formed municipality, taking charge of it's expansion and success. Being aimed at a younger audience than that of the other games within the series a greater emphasis is placed on managing a small, socially ideal town than a sprawling metropolis. As such it features a much more stylized, cartoon representation and user interface, a number of added features allowing for greater interactivity with the populace, and a simplified system of resource management.<br><br>As their first priority as mayor players will simply need to construct a town, supplying not only housing for their residents but employment, schools, and civic buildings as well; Roadways and bike paths being needed to connect them all. While each building has its own associated costs and benefits they're often marginal enough that a player's selection will often be as much an aesthetic consideration as a functional one. In order to finance all of this consideration will also have to be paid to the player's limited resources of water, wood, and crops, which rejuvenate only so quickly.<br><br>Interacting with the populace will also be crucial to success. Individual citizens will often offer suggestions and make demands of the mayor and so a close eye will have to be kept on their opinions of how the city is being run. Those that favor specific types of restaurants will request them and objections will be made if the city is lacking in their preferred form of recreation. Players can also take a closer look at their residents by 'removing' the tops of buildings and peering inside, watching their life unfold on a more minute scale. Specially constructed designer characters can also be made to populate the town, built to pre-defined specifications such as their preferred clothing and personal preferences.<br><br>A number of awards can be gained within the game for exemplary achievements resulting from maintaining a balanced town for some period of time. An in-game newspaper will assist in these efforts by helping to keep the player up to date on what might be wrong in their city, or how they might be succeeding.

Description=Skat 2010 is a simulation of the card game skat. There are many variants, but here is the principle: The game is usually played with three persons. Two of the players are playing against a single one but are not allowed to communicate. Each card has a value and one suit is called "Trumpf". In every round each player looses one of his card and the one which played the "Trumpf" card with the highest value gets all the played cards. If no "Trumpf" is played the highest value scores. At the end each player counts the values of his cards.

Description=Skull Cracker can be considered the spiritual successor to the 1991 title Creepy Castle that Bill Appleton wrote for Reactor Inc. The game is set in an alternate world where it is normal to see zombies and monsters roam the streets. They are kept under control by MEI (Mortality Enforcement, Inc.) - an organization that "helps the dead stay dead". As the monsters grow in number however, they organize themselves and demand civil rights. Since they are a common sight and fairly harmless, people do not worry about them, but a mysterious substance known as Goop changes the monsters' character drastically.<br><br>MEI brings in the freelancers Mortis "The Skullcracker" Rigor and Penelope "Bonebreaker" Jones to bring back order. Players can choose between one of the two characters, each with a distinct fighting style. With side-scrolling brawling gameplay, they need to travel through four main locations of four levels each. Some of the places visited are a shopping mall, an arcade, the graveyard, a playground, the MEI headquarters, and more. Next to moving, jumping, and climbing, they can punch and kick opponents, and use power-ups such as flare guns, flame throwers or supersoakers filled with holy water to take out enemies, while replenishing health with pick-ups.

The green slime blobs do the least damage but are still better than your default gun. The laser beam cuts through columns of aliens like butter. With the 3-way shot and 6-way shot you can spray the aliens like bugs. The grenades explode on impact taking out the surrounding aliens. Laser grenades also explode on impact but they then shoot two laser beams side ways, taking out an entire row of aliens. The flamethrower almost works like an eraser, simply move from left to right to wipe out the enemies. And finally, there's the nuke, a rare power-up that instantly kills all aliens on screen.<br><br>The longer you play, the more the aliens fire back at you, the more you really need power-ups to survive. If your weapon runs out right at the beginning of a wave of aliens, you're stuck with your standard missile weapon which can only take out one alien at a time. So you will have to find a certain rhythm to defeating the waves of aliens, making sure you always have a power-up when a new wave arrives.<br><br>You can play solo or with two players, which makes the game even more frantic. If you don't have someone to play with, you can even play co-op with the computer controlling the second spaceship.

Your goal is to locate the magic crown and as many of the treasures as possible while climbing your way to the top. To make your way up the mountain, you will need to find keys which unlock a path. The keys are hidden somewhere behind an object on each level of the mountain. To find out what is behind an object you need to use one of your magic coins. However, the number of coins you have is limited and there are many places to search so you first need to find clues as to where keys (and treasures!) are located. Wandering about the mountain are numerous elves; if you catch a scroll carrying elf in your net, he'll ask a question. A correct answer will provide a clue. After reaching the top of the multi-leveled mountain, all the treasures you collected along the way will be put back in the treasure chest, and you begin again at the bottom with a tougher difficulty level. After all treasures have been brought to the top, you can find the crown and win the game!

Description=A polygonal 3D fighter, Time Warriors puts eight fighters from eight different times and places against each other: Yrwen the Celt, armed with a long sword, Hysis the Egyptian, wielding two sabers, Molloch the Barbarian with his battle axe, the scimitar-wielding Sultan Iz-Baal, Shodan the Samurai and his katana, from a Chinese monastery Dong brings just a staff, Olof the Viking plans flattening his opponents with a war hammer and Apokles the Spartan brings a double-edged sword.<br><br>Gameplay is similar to other games in the same genre - two buttons control the weapon and two other ones kicking, because both come with a "fast" and a "strong" variant. Combos are done with fast key presses or sequential moves, and by taking damage, the fighter gathers magic points that can be used to perform a destructive special attack. Like Virtua Fighter, if a fighter falls from the battle arena, he or she loses from ring out. The usual options such as combat length, number of bouts, difficulty level and auto-block are included.<br><br>Graphically, the game can be tweaked to run on several configurations, by disabling more advanced graphic options such as scenario objects, light and real-time shadow calculation and textures.

Compiled from early FORTRAN and C sources, this port makes use of its early GUI by presenting a text output window, through which the game communicates to the player, as well as a player input window with buttons to streamline common commands (typically directional in nature) and a text entry box for more esoteric words (such as, for instance, "xyzzy".)  The story and plot, such as it is (grab the treasures, try not to die) is much the same as other ports from its primeval source.  This version, as do many, offers 350 points to be amassed through player action and treasure collection.

Run the program, select "timed fight", and then go about your business... periodically, a little black-hat cowboy will unexpectedly appear somewhere random on your desktop, intone "Draw!", and reach for his six-shooter.  Can you find him and click on him before he plugs you?  If not, perhaps you'd better stick to the mail merge, though you can hone your skills using the "Fight now!" mode to take away the unpredictable timing element.

Description=WinRoids is a shareware Asteroids clone where you have to destroy every asteroid on the level while avoiding being hit by the debris (asteroids get split into smaller parts when hit) and the occasional flying saucers. The game uses newtonian physics which means that you use your thrusters to accelerate in a direction, and the ship keeps moving in that direction and velocity - regardless of the current direction your ship is pointing - until you use your thrusters again to decelerate or change your direction.<br><br>The levels are on a single screen with looped borders. Anything that exits the screen on one side,  will enter the screen on the other. This includes your own shots. Apart from the random enemy UFOs, there are also randomly appearing bonus crates containing extra lives, weapon upgrades and shield generators.<br>The graphics are high resolution (for 1994) pre-rendered 2D sprites in cartoon or 50's sci-fi style.

Description=Yellow Brick Road is an action adventure title inspired by the Oz Books by L. Frank Baum.  The game concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King.  Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow.  Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz.  The game is short and ends in a cliff hanger designed to lead into the next chapter, Yellow Brick Road II.  However, that game was never localized outside of Japan.<br><br>The adventure portion is kept to a minimum, primarily designed to advance the plot to the next battle without any real puzzles to speak of.<br><br>The battles are the meat of the game and they are fairly unique.  The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions.  Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game.  The more powerful items act differently depending on who uses them.  For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again.  This is important as enemies progress toward the companions side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them the battle is lost and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field the battle is won and the game progresses.  Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations and against some are immune.  Trial and error combined with quick reflexes and a good strategy of making sure not all of the characters are recuperating at the same time is the only way to succeed.
