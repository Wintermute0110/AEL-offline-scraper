Description=Based on the scripts of the 21st movie "Casino Royale" and the 22nd James Bond movie of the same name as the game, it follows closely the story of those movies but elaborates many scenes and fills in some blanks.<br><br>In a first person shooter fashion, the player directs Bond through the levels filled with many bad guys. To overcome those, Bond has several different kinds of weapons at his disposal ranging from his trusted P99, over machine guns to full blown grenade launchers. But the levels are also filled with canisters that either explode upon shooting or vent gas that temporarily blinds the enemy. Bond can also perform a take down move which puts an enemy out silently. If Bond is near enough to an enemy, a button press will initiate the corresponding mini-game in which the player needs to hit a circle with a crosshair in a short period of time. Is the player successful,  the enemy is out of the play but when he fails to hit the mark in time, Bond will be thrown away from the enemy and is vulnerable for a short period of time. In addition Bond can duck into cover to avoid bullets and shoot blindly over it or look out of it to get the kill. Bond also automatically regenerates his health when not under fire.<br><br>Other obstacles in the levels are cameras, which can either be shot or disabled and electronic locks which need to be hacked in another mini-game. There arrows flash green or red on the screen and the player needs to press the corresponding button fast enough when it blink green to input the right number into the keypad.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode for up to 12 players with the following game modes:<br><br>1. Bond Versus: one player takes over the control of James Bond and either needs to defuse two of the three bombs in the level or kill all six of the opposing team. In this mode Bond can also see all enemies and has two lives.<br><br>2. Golden Gun: the first player to score 100 points wins the round. Points are earned by kills but if the player is holding the always visible power weapon called "Golden Gun", he scores 6 points per kill.<br><br>3. Bond Evasion: in this mode one member of the MI6-team randomly gets to be Bond and needs to get to the escape point of the map to win the round for his team. Meanwhile The Organization tries to stop him by either killing him or preventing him to reach the escape points in time.

Description=Long, long ago, in the kingdom of Dotnia, an evil king plunged the world into an age of darkness.  But, from the shadows emerged a hero, who with the help of six sages, trapped him in the powerful Dark Orb.  Dotnia celebrated, and many people came to visit, ensuring a prosperous time.  But, over the years, the visitors waned.  "People are no longer interested in 2D," exclaimed the king.  "It's time to make the move to 3D!"  And so the kingdom of Dotnia became 3D... but now, the princess has disappeared, and monsters have begun to overrun the kingdom.  Could the evil king be returning?<br><br>3D Dot Game Heroes is an action adventure game heavily inspired by the original Legend of Zelda, as well as other classic console RPGs.  As with the Zelda series, the player character doesn't actually 'level up' through gaining experience, but instead discovers items which make them more powerful or allow them to access new areas, such as a boomerang which lets you hit faraway switches and bombs which can destroy rocks that block your path.  There are six temples which must be found, as these contain the sages who can help seal away the evil king and rescue the kingdom.<br><br>The player can also find more powerful swords as they progress through the game.  When the player's health is full and they swing their sword, the sword quadruples in size, annihilating anything in its path.  If the player is hurt, then their sword only swings at its normal size.  The player can visit a blacksmith to forge the sword and add to its length, width, power and more.  The game also allows players to create their own custom characters with the game's easy-to-use character editor.

Only he who carries The Number Two has the right to challenge The Number One, and to avenge his father, Afro has dedicated his life to becoming The Number Two and killing the man who wears The Number One.<br><br>Afro Samurai is a third-person action game based on the anime created by Takashi Okazaki and Gonzo and starring Samuel L. Jackson. Each stage chronicles an important event in Afro's quest for revenge, culminating in a boss fight at the end. The defining feature of the combat is Afro's ability to enter "focus mode," where the screen goes black-and-white and the action slows down, allowing for a "perfect slice" attack which can slice enemies literally to pieces. It must be charged after use, with the charge represented by a pendant hanging from Afro's sword.<br><br>As Afro kills enemies, he levels up earning new skills and increasing his power and stamina. Collecting "mementos" strewn around each stage will also unlock special abilities called "father's legacy", which are often extra-devastating moves that can easily take down even stronger enemies.

Sometimes enemies need to be engaged, while in other friendly fighters help along, stealth must be used, or a specific target needs to be pursued and taken out. There are two main weapons: regular cannon fire for close distances and rockets that can only be used when they are locked on. There is also a Climax gauge that can be activated when it is full. Time slows down and multiple enemies can be targeted. As soon as the aircraft leaves the Climax mode, all selected targets are engaged with rockets at once. Cannon fire is unlimited, and rockets as well, as long as the player does not use them constantly. At the same time enemy rockets need to be dodged by moving up, down, left or right, or doing barrel rolls. Just like the previous game in the series there is a limited amount of manoeuvrability without complete freedom. It is however possible to move the speed of the aircraft.<br><br>During the games players can unlock many EX options to further customize the arcade mode, as well as make available different paint schemes: Standard, Camouflage, Special and Low Visibility. There is also a secondary scoring mode with an unlimited amount of credits.

Description=Aliens vs Predator is an update of the 1999 PC game  Aliens Versus Predator, in which the player can choose either Marine, Xenomorph (commonly known as Aliens) or Predator in a first-person shooter.  The story takes place on the planet designated BG-386, in a mining colony owned by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation where they have found a mysterious site; an ancient pyramid that depicts an unknown alien race and the Xenomorphs.  Curious, they decide to forcibly open the doors and cause a massive energy backlash that causes the power on the entire planet to go out, unleashing hell in the process.  This is where the story begins for the three factions:<br><br>1. Marines:  The player takes control of the &quot;Rookie&quot; as they are dispatched to the planet to investigate the distress signal.  Once arriving they realize that a Alien outbreak has occurred and the player must traverse various environments.  There are various weapons such as a pistol, pulse rifle, sniper rifle, flamethrower, shotgun and the smart gun the player can use against the various enemies scattered throughout the stages.  There is also the iconic motion tracker that can pick up on enemy movement, flares and a flashlight for seeing in very dark spaces and stims that will replenish their health.<br><br>2. Aliens:  The player takes control of an Alien nicknamed &quot;Six&quot;.  Captured and raised by Weyland-Yutani scientists, Six has been hearing the call of the Matriarch for a period of time, desperate to escape and join his brethren.  When the power in the colony goes out, Six escapes and begins to wreak havoc against the humans and propagate his species across the planet.  The Aliens are considered very weak and vulnerable and only have their claws and tails as weapons, but possess great speed and the ability to climb on walls and ceilings.  Health can automatically regenerate, but the player can bite the head of a fallen enemy to automatically regenerate their health.<br><br>3. Predators:  The player takes control of a Youngblood; fresh from training he receives word from the Predator council that a distress signal from a long lost hunting ground has been set off.  He is then dispatched to the planet to investigate, upon arriving he discovers humans have taken over the planet and unleashed the serpents (The term the Predators use for the Aliens) upon the planet.  The council orders him to wipe out the human and alien presence and discover the secret of the hunting grounds.  Weapons include the Plasma Caster, Wrist blades, Combi-Stick, Mines and the Smart Disc with health being replenished through shards.  The Predator can also leap across long distances, mimic voices to distract victims away from groups and use their signature cloaking device to move through enemy encampments without being detected.<br><br>Along with the single-player campaign there are also several multiplayer modes including:<br><br>1. Survivor: A group of four marines surviving against waves of advancing aliens.<br><br>4. Predator Hunt: Out of a group of Marines one will be chosen to be the Predator, the goal being that the player can use the Predator to gain extra points through killing other players and extend the time limit of being the Predator.  If a Marine player can kill the Predator then they will become Predator until they are killed or time runs out.<br><br>5. Infestation: Similar to Predator Hunt, out of a group of Marines one will be chosen to be an Alien, the goal of being to kill the Marines and earn points.  However, when an Alien player kills a Marine then that Marine will become an Alien and join that player.<br><br>6. Deathmatch: Standard free-for-all ranging up to 18-players<br><br>7. Species Deathmatch: Three groups of players use teamwork to take out the other teams of the opposite species, basically Marines vs. Aliens vs. Predators.<br><br>8. Mixed Species Deathmatch: Three groups of players of mixed species fighting other mixed teams.<br><br>9. Domination: A group of players vie for various strongholds scattered throughout the map, the goal of which to take these points and reach a certain point count to win the match.<br><br>Players also gain experience points through winning matches, killing enemies in different ways (i.e. getting more points for trophy kills) or a killing streak.

There's a TV which allows the player to keep up with current events (or get new assignments), a weapons locker to choose his load-out with and, more importantly, a computer to check his email and visit the "Clearinghouse". The latter is a black market service where the player can sell stuff he found during missions and buy additional gear (including weapons, armor and special items) or upgrades like a bigger magazine for the pistol. The money needed for that however, the player has to earn himself. Alpha Protocol doesn't want to be traced back to Mike, so during the missions, the player not only fulfills his given objectives, may they be capturing or killing an enemy or finding intel, but is also on the lookout for money-bags lying around or ways to convince other people to give him some.<br><br>This is mostly done through dialogues which, similar to Mass Effect 2, offer several different choices. But as opposed the Bioware-game, the player only has a limited time to make his choice. The amount of available choices the player has, greatly depends on how much the Mike knows about the person he's facing, increasing the need for him to gather intel before, during and after missions. One way again is the Clearinghouse which also offers ways to make a mission easier like bribing a bunch of guards to not show up for work that day.<br><br>Depending on his choice during a dialogue or simply by answering an email a special way and during normal gameplay, not only his relationship with the person he's talking to changes - news of the player's actions travel around the world, changing how enemies and friendlies alike view the player even before their first encounter, making it sometimes easier or more difficult for Mike to persuade his opponent. Every person in the game even reacts to certain kinds of attitudes better than others. Being suave to Mina (another employee of Alpha Protocol) may seem a good idea at first but she's more into the professional type for example.<br><br>If all fails and on his way to the main target, Mike has several other options to deal with a situation, the most obvious one being to pull out one of his several different types of guns and shoot his way through the mission. But even then just going in and pulling the trigger is mostly a waste of ammo as taking the time and aim increases not only the accuracy but also the change to score a critical hit. If the player is more of a peaceful and/or sneaky nature, he can however take the stealth-route. This allows him to make one-hit take downs of an unsuspecting enemy as well as avoid many obstacles. Especially sneaking around involves a lot of hacking, lock-picking doors and rerouting electronics to go around enemies, stop alarms or just get additional intel. Each of these tasks involves a small mini-game which increases in difficulty as the player advances through the game.<br><br>Each kill, hack, successful dialogue and completed mission objective earns Mike experience points which in turn allow him to level up and earn advancement points. These are used to upgrade the nine available skills like "Stealth" or "Assault Rifles" up to 10 times. If a skill is completely upgraded, the player can then choose to specialise it, unlocking 5 additional ranks to dumb points in. This can however only be done for three skills. Investing points into a skill unlocks both permanent bonuses like less recoil when using a pistol to special abilities. "Awareness" for example is a stealth-ability which allows the player to see all enemies and which direction they are currently facing even through walls. At higher stealth-ranks, this effect becomes permanent.

For some reason, the reconstruction of Altaïr's memories is vital to the captors.<br><br>After accessing Altaïr's memory, Desmond is able to experience the events that took place in the Holy Land in the year 1191, the time of the Third Crusade. Al Mualim, the leader of the assassins, orders Altaïr to kill nine prominent historical figures, who supposedly let war and corruption take over the Holy Land.<br><br>During most of the game, the player controls Altaïr; however, it is clearly indicated that controlling him is a part of Desmond's experience. The player is also able to control Desmond between his sessions in the "Animus".<br><br>The game's most innovative feature is the freedom of choice and movement. Every architectural detail like window ledges, carvings in the stone or wooden bars can be used to move on the walls. This allows the player to have intense chase scenes if by any chance you're hunted by the guard.<br><br>There are several ways you can reach your goal in the game.

You can then use this information to choose whether you take on the targets by full frontal assault or with a properly placed throwing knife from the cover of the rooftops.<br><br>Depending on your choice, you'll have to deal with the citizens and knights of the cities who will become suspicious of a cloaked person wondering on the rooftops or near the mission targets.

Description=Assassin's Creed II continues exactly where the original left off. The player controls Desmond Miles, and who was connected to the Animus device, allowing him to experience past events in search of a mystical power the Templars were interested in. After the end credits roll in the Assassin's Creed, by going into the Eagle Vision mode in Desmond's room (more of a holding cell, really) a set of strange symbols became visible on the wall. That's where this game starts off.<br><br>One of the scientists asks Desmond to put his trust in her hands and follow her out of the complex. Soon afterwards they escape the holding place and team up with some new allies that don't seem to force him as his previous captors did. Their new device is called Animus 2.0 and is an upgraded version of the original device that let him experience past events. This time, he will go back to Italy in the 15th century.<br><br>Unlike the prior game, Desmond and the player will get to know the past-event character quite well before he puts on a cloak and hood. His name's Ezio Auditore di Firenze, a sly little rascal who likes to pick fights and chase skirts, but all that changes when his father and little brother are publicly executed by the man he trusted.<br><br>This game provides a learning curve that will go equally well for new players and those who played the original game. Although most of the moves stayed the same, the game comes with a plethora of new offerings. For starters, there are many weapons in the game: weapons one can pick up from enemies (even though they cannot be carried permanently, unless purchased in the armory). Ezio can carry a sword-type weapon, a dagger-type weapon, throwing knives, smoke bombs, a pistol, and a bunch of upgradeable armour (you can even unlock Altair's armour which does not require any repairing, unlike any other armor in the game).<br><br>Jumping on the roofs, escaping the angry guards, taking a leap of faith, riding a horse and climbing to virtually any point one can see is all there from the original. On top of that, there are chariot chases, swimming, or even flying using one of Leonardo's inventions (yup, Leonardo da Vinci is a very good friend in this game). With a stealth approach, one can use courtesans to distract the guards or to help Ezio blend in. Mercenaries can be hired to help in fighting guards; thieves can be commissioned to create a distraction... one can always just go guns blazing and fight one's way up to becoming notorious and making any guard attack on sight.<br><br>The travels in the past take place in 15th century Italy, namely to Florence, Venice, Rome and more. A lot of lying gold chests and sub-quests significantly add to gameplay time, but most of the quests are not obligatory in order to reach the game's ultimate goal. The game is mostly in 3rd-person perspective but lets the player switch to 1st-person view virtually anywhere.

By performing well in races, players earn prize & sponsorship money and experience points to buy better machines and unlock higher classes. In order to secure the sponsorship money, their logos must still be on the car at the end of the race, so too much damage to the car will result in the player not getting paid. The vehicles can be tuned and modified to increase performance.<br><br>There are five different race modes; circuit which is a standard race where you do a few laps of a track against opponents, rally which a point to point time-trial, hill climb which as it suggests is drive up a steep hill, and then back down, open class where different categories of car race against each other with a handicap system in place to disadvantage the more powerful ones and Baja which is an endurance race lasting between 250-1000 miles. The Baja mode races can last up to several hours.

Description=Battlefield: Bad Company is a war-themed first person shooter and the second in the series developed exclusively for the console platforms. The title refers to a a group of the 222nd Army battalion of soldiers considered hard to steer and incompetent troublemakers. As such, they do not receive much respect in battle and squad of four decides to desert to pursue their own goals. The war takes places in fictional countries in the Middle East and the US squad takes on Russians, soldiers of the Middle East coalition and Legionnaire mercenaries. The player controls protagonist Preston Marlowe. His squad members are Terrence Sweetwater, George Gordon Haggard Jr. and the leader Samuel Redford.<br><br>Marlowe has a health injector he can use as many times as he desires to restore his health. When dying, he also respawns immediately at the last location. Players can only carry a maximum of four weapons at any given time. There are many vehicles to drive, such as hummers, buggies, boats, tanks, boats and even helicopters to control. The storyline takes the characters through different fictional countries with mission where their background and motivation is gradually revealed.<br><br>The new Frostbite DX engine makes it possible to destroy many objects and buildings, almost to completely demolishing them. This changes the way the environment can be used as a cover, as everything can be destroyed. The multiplayer portion features games with a ranking system where items and weapons are gradually unlocked. The base game includes only one mode, Gold Rush, with teams of attackers and defenders.<br><br>Through five events such as describing to the newsletter, pre-ordering the game or reaching a certain rank in the demo, players could receive player codes to unlock five new weapons: F2000 assault rifle, USAS-12 semi-automatic shotgun, M60 light machine gun, QBU-88 sniper rifle and the silenced UZI submachine gun.

Description=Before America dropped the bomb on Japan, a squad of commandos infiltrated an island in the Sea of Japan to exfiltrate a Japanese scientist. He was working on a secret weapon codenamed Aurora. But before the commandos could escape the island, Japan activated Aurora and killed everyone.<br><br>Battlefield: Bad Company 2 takes place in the present day after the events in Battlefield: Bad Company. The four members of B-Company, better known as Bad Company, Privates Preston Marlowe, Terrence Sweetwater, George Haggard, and Sergeant Samuel Redford are sent behind Russian enemy lines to secure a device related to Aurora. But although they managed to escape Russian soldiers and completed their supposedly final mission, the device turns out to be a fake. Consequently Army General Braidwood assigns them to a special operation of stopping Aurora.<br><br>The fairly linear single player campaign puts the player into the shoes of Private Preston Marlowe, sending him off to uncover the mysteries surrounding Aurora in a typical first-person-shooter-fashion. On the side of the other members of Bad Company, the player tries to fulfill the various objectives of the missions while gunning down several dozens enemies using a huge arsenal of real-world military equipment but limited to only carrying two main weapons and a side-arm at the same time. During the course of the game, the player unlocks new weapons by finding them during his missions, granting him the ability to equip them from then on at every supply drop.<br><br>As in previous installments of the Battlefield series, the core of the game is again the class-based and team-based multiplayer for up to 32 players, divided into squads with four men each. Four game modes are available: Rush, Conquest, Squad-Rush and Squad-Deathmatch. Each mode can also be played on "Hardcore"-difficulty, deactivating the cross-hair, the mini-map and such. The four modes in detail:<br><br>1. Rush requires the two teams, Russians and Americans, to either defend or destroy mobile transmitters. Once the attacking team successfully destroys one, the battlefield is expanded and the fight moves on to the next transmitter.<br>2. Conquest is once again all about capturing and holding flags.<br>3. Squad-Rush has two squads fighting for two mobile transmitters at the same time.<br>4. Squad-Deathmatch pits squads against each other with the winner being the squad that scores the most kills.<br><br> The available classes are Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon. Each class has their own set of weapons and gadgets. While the Engineer has his repair torch to repair tanks and other machinery, the Medic uses his Defibrillator to revive fallen team members and prevent the loss of a ticket. Each class gets access to new weapons and equipment by leveling up. The players get experience points for killing people, capturing flags, fulfilling objectives and earning achievements like killing 7 enemies in one round with a light machine gun. Additional points are gained, if the player interacts with one of his current squad-mates. With these experience points, the player levels both up his class to unlock new stuff as well as his overall rank.<br><br>Although the game is very infantry-heavy, vehicles like bikes, tanks or helicopters stand ready to be used in the fight. Tanks are especially useful to take full advantage of the so-called Destruction 2.0 system, which allow the players to take down whole buildings if enough fire power is used. The health system is a mix of using med-packs and automatic healing. If a player still dies and isn't resurrected by a Medic, he can either choose to respawn at a stationary points like the home base or captured flags, or use one of his squad-mates as an entry point.

Description=The official game of the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, Beijing 2008 features 32 national teams in 38 events for both men and women on a varied number of disciplines, played in truthful representations of the stadiums that hosted the real Games in the summer of 2008 such as the Birds' Nest or the Watercube.<br><br>As usual with games in this genre (some events play in a particular similar fashion to Athens 2004), button mashing and timing makes up the core of the gameplay, with some exceptions and novel ideas. In now-classic events such as sprinting running and swimming, instead of mashing the power buttons as soon as the starting pistol is heard, the player has to control a bar with the trigger buttons, where the player jumps from the blocks when it is completely filled and has to be careful not to fill the bar too soon (resulting in a false start) or too late (losing precious time). Other events also have their share of gameplay innovations in the genre, such as the Javelin, where the analogue stick is used to set the throw and accurately define the angle accurately. <br>In the most off-beat events, diving and rings requires the player to follow the on-screen cue with the analogue pads, while others such as the the floor exercise and beam require the player to follow the button queues - there are three difficulty levels, mostly changing the looseness of the timing - in higher levels, the player will have a much harder time hitting "perfect" moves and some of them will require much faster combinations.<br><br>One of the most novel events is Judo, where the player must react quickly to the on-screen cues in order to gain advantage during the grappling phase - once there's an opening chance for an attack, the player can press one button to initiate a throw, and if the mis-match was large enough (a "Perfect" against a "Very Good" won't allow for an Ippon throw, and the defending player with block the attack, starting another grappling sequence). The player being thrown must bash the appropriate button to decrease the power bar to avoid being projected with his back down, which would result on an Ippon and instant defeat. While an Ippon decides the match instantly, two Waza-ari also decide, with the lowest scores (Koka and Yuko) usually deciding matches stopped by the clock. The player can also choose to do a choke or lock move, where both players must press the triggers, and unless the defending player does not break the lock in a limited time frame, he concedes an Ippon and loses the match.<br>Table Tennis also makes an appearance, and is an event where the player must be properly placed to respond with either a well-timed normal or backspin shot, the timing defining the accuracy of the shot. Good returns fill a power bar, and once it's filled, the player can do a particularly vicious shot that when well executed is nearly impossible to return - however, being able to return these shots becomes the essence of each set, same with doing perfect serves.<br><br>Game modes include practice, regular competition (where the player can select or deselect each event, for men and women), random events, Decathlon or Heptathlon and of course, the Olympics. While in previous games the Olympics were usually just a set of events, in Beijing 2008 they are much more complex, and feature a game where the player must complete a number of challenges each day with the difficulty level and number of necessary successes increasing progressively. While in the other modes there is a slight slowdown during the technical parts of the events, in Olympic the player must assign points to it, and trigger when required. The player also needs to assign points to other key areas, such as speed, technique or accuracy. Failing to reach the goal for the day forces the player to load the game and try again.

Gameplay combines elements from the Tomb Raider and God of War series.<br><br>As Beowulf, the player fights his way through a number of episodes commanding his band of merry Thanes via a small selection of commands. Beowulf can chant with his band to boost the morale and max out damage out, triggered through a rhythm button mashing mini-game. There are more mini-games similar to the chanting throughout the game. Some appear right in the middle of combat while trying to grapple a large monster similar to sequences in God of War.<br><br>Beowulf can lift enemies with brute strength and hurl them in any direction, even at other enemies. He can also alternate weapons by picking up new ones, lying discarded on the ground, or from racks of weapons that may be found in many places. Also in combat Beowulf can enter Carnal Mode that increases his strength but demoralizes Thanes, so players won't be able to use it frequently or the entire kingdom will be sad and dismal. In certain areas the player needs to find a path to continue, sometimes by climbing walls and grabbing small ledges. All characters are voiced by the original actors who starred in the film.

Hailed as heroes he and his comrade Joseph "Super Joe" Gibson became responsible for the training of new recruits under the flag of the TASC. But when Spencer disobeyed an order from Gibson during Operation Blackout, which lead to the death of several TASC agents, Spencer was court-martialed and sentenced to death while through his actions the public changed its opinion about bionic technology leading to the cancellation of the program and the "Bionic Purge". During the purge all TASC personnel were ordered to turn in their bionics or have them forcibly removed. Some fled, others obeyed but in the end bionic technology was effectively removed from the nation - at least until terrorists from BioReign detonate an atomic bomb in Ascension City. With no military unit returning from Ground Zero once gone in, Nathan is spared his fate for now and is instead send in to deal with the situation under the promise to get new information about the where-abouts of his missing wife Emily.<br><br>In a classic 3rd-person-shooter-style, the player moves through the destroyed city, fulfilling objectives like activating a relay station and thereby deactivating a minefield and killing the countless enemies (including mechs and other deadly vehicles) blocking his way. Literally always at his side: his Bionic Arm. While it can be used to just throw a nasty punch, the built-in grappling hook is the real clue on that device. It not only allows the player to swing around fast and even climb up the highest skyscraper, it's also a handy tool to get rid of enemies and for removing other annoying obstacles. At the same time Nathan also can use normal weapons with his right hands like pistols or grenades. Besides BioReign-forces, the environment itself is also an enemy to Nathan with radioactive zones killing him almost instantly. And due to the weight of his Bionic Arm, Nathan can't swim and will drown when he falls into water.<br><br>To keep things interesting, the game features both collectibles and challenges. While the collectibles are simply hidden in the levels, challenges are offered once the player has done something, gains a new ability and such. The goals of these challenges include killing 25 enemies, making three consecutive swings or destroying three train wagons. Once a challenge has been met, the player immediately gains a bonus like better armor and often gets the same challenge again - only this time with increased requirements.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer-mode for up to eight player featuring Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch and Capture the Flag on small, mostly vertical maps allowing the players to make full use of the Bionic Arm the same way as in single-player.

Description=BioShock is considered the spiritual successor of System Shock 2 and mixes first-person shooting with role-playing elements. In the year 1960 a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with you as the only survivor. You have the apparent luck of resurfacing in front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating, you enter the door and soon you are taught that this is the city of Rapture, a paradise of free will build in the 40s by Andrew Ryan, visually and socially inspired by objectivism of Ayn Rand. However, even before you assimilate all this new information, the descent to this supposed paradise ends and you only see ruins and chaos. Learning about the destiny of Rapture will be now your main motivation while you have to survive to the horrors that the free will can create.<br><br>A sci-fi plot based on a social system that fails is not the only thing BioShock shares with it predecessor, as many features of its gameplay and even elements of Rapture are easily recognizable in SS2. Bioshock is an FPS, but with many elements that make the gameplay more complex than just shooting your enemies while advancing in the game. In addition to the usual, and not so usual, fire and melee weapons, the main character can use "plasmids", genetic tools created in Rapture that can give superpowers, like telekinesis or fire throwing, to those who use them. The enemies are also more complex, in the sense that they do not always go after your character to kill him. Most of them are inhabitants of Rapture, victims of the bizarre experiments performed in the city and empowered themselves with plasmids. There are also security devices that you can use for your advantage or creatures with symbiotic relationships like the "Big Daddies" and the "Little Sisters" and many others to be discovered. All of these features and some abilities of interaction with the surrounding give the player many ways of facing each situation.<br><br>The entire game takes place in an underwater setting using an improved Vengeance engine, a heavily modified version of UnrealEngine3. Rapture is in ruins, you can see that everywhere you go and water is the key to all this. Water is what surrounds you and the city all the time and what slowly devours it with you inside. The water also helps building the dark atmosphere of Rapture the same way genetic engineering (and underwater architecture) helps establishing the sci-fi bases of the plot. Both, the setting and the plot are completed with many 50s furniture and propaganda, à la the Fallout series.<br><br>The Xbox 360 and Windows version were released simultaneously. A PS3 port was only announced afterwards and was released more than a year later. There are no graphical improvements, except for the "horizontal plus" widescreen option that was introduced through a Xbox 360 patch. The cut-scenes are also in a higher resolution. A new addition is the Survivor Mode with a harder difficulty level.

Description=Ten years have passed since the events in BioShock. The underwater-city Rapture has further deteriorated, with water breaking in everywhere and whole sections flooded by water. But as bad as the situation is, the city still isn’t empty. After Andrew Ryan’s death, his long adversary, the psychiatrist Dr. Sophia Lamb took over the helm – embracing her own cult, making the mutated splicers that roam the city her worshippers. In the middle is Delta, the first of the protectors of the Little Sisters better known as Big Daddies. Eternally bonded to one and only one Little Sister called Eleanor, daughter of Sophia Lamb, he’s damned to search the city and find her or die trying.<br><br>The player slips into the mighty boots of Delta, making his way in a typical first-person-shooter-style through the city of Rapture to find and confront Dr. Sophia Lamb, who holds Eleanor against her will. The switch of perspective, in the first game the player was a normal human, also brings with it a few changes in gameplay. The most important being, that the player can now use both one of the eleven available plasmids and one of the several different weapons at the same time, allowing him to burn enemies while pumping them full of bullets. Other plasmids include “Winter Blast” which freezes an enemy or “Scout” which allows the player to leave his body and look around unnoticed. The weapons on the hand range from the famous Big-Daddy-Drill over a powerful double-barrel-shotgun to a grenade launcher.<br><br>As in the first game, both weapons and plasmids are upgradeable. While the weapons just require the player to find a special workstation, upgrades for plasmids and tonics (granting passive effects) are bought at special vending machines called “Gatherer’s Garden” with the rare substance called “Adam”. As in the first game, the Little Sisters roaming the levels are the key to getting access to Adam. But since the player himself is a Big Daddy, the process is a bit different this time around. While the player still needs to kill the accompanying Big Daddy to get access to the Little Sister, he can choose to adopt it afterwards instead of just harvesting it. The Little Sister will then sit on his shoulder and look for Adam-infused bodies in the level to harvest them.<br><br>Setting down a Little Sister to harvest a body will unleash hell as every splicer in the level will try to kill her, requiring the player to protect the little girl from harm until its finished collecting. Once a Little Sister has harvested two bodies, the player can again either harvest her himself, or free her. Either action grants him more or less Adam and at the same time may alert a Big Sister. As opposed to the Big Daddies, they are nimble, fast and very deadly.<br><br>Another important change is the new hacking-mini-game which is the same in all versions now and requires the player to hit the green or blue spaces on a gauge with a constantly spinning needle. If he doesn’t hit the right field, he either gets a electro-shock or will sound the alarm. A successful hack on the other will lower the prices at vending machines or turn turrets over to the player’s side. The new mini-game also allows the player to fight and walk around while hacking as well as hacking from a distance thanks to the arrows shot by the hacking-tool.<br><br>BioShock 2 features multiplayer for up to 10 players which was developed independently from the single player by a different developer and tells the story before the first game. By gaining ranks for kills and winning matches, the player unlocks access to additional radio messages advancing the story behind the civil war that raged in the city between the Splicers and Andrew Ryan’s security force. The available multiplayer-mode include Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture and Hold, Capture the Sister and Adam Grab. The latter requires the players to collect and protect the sole Little Sister in the level in order to gain points. Capture the Sister on the other hand puts two teams against each other with one team trying to bring the Little Sister to a vent and the other trying to prevent that. Each mode also features the possibility of one player slipping into the role of a Big Daddy.

Instead you encounter mutated humans and other strange creatures. With one man down you escape that hell and move on.<br><br>Now you are called to Nevada because something terrible happened there (see Area-51) and it affected the nearby city. But you soon realize, that all this has something to do with what you encountered inside the bunker three years ago.<br><br>The game is a pretty straight-forward first person shooter. You move through the levels, kill everything that moves and fulfil your objectives. To aid you in that task, you've a squad full of people under your command. With the help of cursor-sensitive commands you order them around and let them man a stationary MG for example. But there are also marked points in the levels at which your squad will perform scripted tasks like a door breach.<br><br>Depending on the difficulty you need to watch the moral of your team mates very carefully. While a high morale will make your squad very aggressive and increase their aim, they'll take more cover and be less accurate when they don't feel so confident. To increase morale you just need to do a good job or give your team mates a common target to shoot at.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer-mode with several game modes. These include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Abduction. In Abduction there are two teams: the humans and the Reborn. One player randomly starts as a Reborn and whenever a Reborn kills a human, the human will respawn as a Reborn. For such a kill a Reborn gets two points and all surviving humans gain a bonus point. After all humans are abducted, the round ends and the player with the most points wins the match.

Lead soldiers, warriors and fellow swords for hire into battle on horseback or on foot, fighting alongside Joan of Arc or the King of England as you strive to become the mercenary champion and gain fame and fortune during these dark times.<br><br>The gameplay takes place in a 3rd-person perspective and takes the form of an action / RPG of sorts. The 'central hub' of the game is a local bar where the player attempts to find jobs that will increase his or her wealth and reputation, as well as dealers that will allow the player to change weaponry or buy more troops to fight alongside them. This hub area also serves as a meeting place for characters from the game world and the player may gleam information from gossip heard that will help them later in-game. Talking to the barman within will present a roster of missions available, the length of that particular campaign and the reward for success - these can take place on either the English or French side (you cannot ally with just one faction). Selecting one of these missions will take you to the battlefield.<br><br>The main game itself is broken down into what first appears to be a strategy sort of game in which the player is shown which territories they have to take to successfully complete the mission - however any strategic element ends here. They can then select which 'home camp' to start from. Once this is chosen they are presented with a battlefield (similar in respects to dynasty warriors). The main objective is to make their way to the castle / village to be taken and successfully seize it from the occupying troops. battling with any enemy troops they encounter along the way. <br><br>The player can command a number of differing types of combatants, from archers to footsoldiers to horseback, and later on in-game camel and elephant riders. Battles are a simple hack and slash affair, with the player attempting to clear the area of enemy troops. Once this has been achieved a base commander will appear at the base under siege. Beat this commander and the player will have seized the territory and completed the mission. Extra fame can be achieved from beating in combat the VIP enemies found throughout the mission. This in turn will also yield treasure for the player, some of which is collectible throughout the game.<br><br>As such, Bladestorm has no end - the player will continue to fight battles as they progress (This is after all the Hundred Years' War!), but there is a story arc within the game to be completed, and the amount of missions - although very similar can give players a lot game content to keep them happy.

The gameplay is quite varied, with about 18 flyable planes during the SP campaign (fighters, recon planes, dive, torpedo and level bombers) and diverse tasks and locations that prevent the game from being overly repetitive, despite a general dogfighting approach.

Description=Blur is an action-oriented racing game very similar to the Mario Kart series. But instead of driving on go-carts through colorful environments shooting bananas and turtle shells, the game features dozens of licensed sports-cars from several different manufacturers including the Audi Quattro, the Nissan 350Z and the Shelby GT-500 racing around fantasy and real-world tracks. <br><br>Scattered around these tracks are three different types of power-ups including a repair kit and a shield as well as five different weapons, like the target-seeking Shunt, which of course are used to get rid of the competition. To that end, each car is very unique in its statistics like strength, acceleration and such, making it a very tactical decision which one to use for the different types of races and tracks. The events include normal races with and without power-ups as well as pure destruction focused ones either taking place in specially build arenas or on normal race tracks.<br><br>The core of the game is the single-player campaign. Divided into nine groups and taking place at over 14 different real-world locations, the player has to make his way to the top. Each group includes several different events including a boss fight. If the player wins the latter, he earns their cars including the unique mods and finishing. To unlock new events and groups, the player has to earn lights - up to seven for each event. While he gets five lights for taking first place, the final two can only be obtained by pleasing the fans.<br><br>Each event features a Fan Target and a Fan Run. Fan Runs are mini-challenges which are activated during a race and require the player to drive through a series of glowing arcs - while the normal race still continues. Besides a bonus light, this will also earn him additional fans. The rest of the fans which are needed to reach the Fan Target are "collected" by shooting and destroying other cars or by impressing with cool driving skills like making drifts or long jumps and such.<br><br>The game also offers a multiplayer mode for up to four players on one machine or up to 20 online. While offline multiplayer only allows the players to choose from all the available cars, online multiplayer offers unlockable car upgrades and mods. In addition the player advances in rank by winning events. Once he reaches level 50, he can choose to enter Legendary mode. Similar to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the player then loses all his accomplishments and is reset to rank 1 but earns an exclusive Legendary car for doing so. This reset can be done up to ten times.

At the beginning of the game the player chooses between one of four characters:<br><br>1. Roland: A former soldier. He likes to play with rifles and shotguns and has a Scorpio-Turret at his disposal to keep his back clear.<br>2. Lilith: A Siren and Phasewalker. She can turn invisible and fights with extreme speed.<br>3. Mordecai: A hunter. He prefers to snipe enemies from a distance and has access to a bird of prey called Bloodwing.<br>4. Brick: A Berserker. He doesn't care much for guns and instead uses his fists to win all arguments.<br><br>Each of the four characters has three different skill-trees available, filled with talents that e.g. increase bullet damage or allow the player to resurrect a friend in cooperative game. The player gets one skill-point to spend at each level up which is of course earned through gaining enough experience points by killing enemies and fulfilling quests for the various NPCs inhabiting the planet Pandora. To kill all those enemies and survive the journey, the player will find weapons, ammunition, useful items like shields or medipacks, upgrades and money on the enemies he kills as well as in chests scattered around the landscape or buy them at vending machines. Weapons and shields come in different types of quality, can have several different types of attributes and mostly come with a level-requirement. The maximum level a player can reach is 50.<br><br>Since the player has to travel around much, he has a buggy available armed with a machine gun and a rocket launcher or heavy machine gun at later levels. Since the game also features a drop in/drop out-coop-mode for up to four players, the buggies have enough room for two players with one using the mounted turret and the other driving around the vehicle.

Description=Braid is a puzzle game disguised as a 2D platformer. The player controls Tim during his search for a princess he has known and lost. Although the objective appears to be rather straightforward at first, the meaning and the motives become much more implicit and are interwoven with the mechanics during the course of the game. From a main hub, Tim can eventually access six worlds that consist of different areas. The start of each world reveals a part of the Tim's background and emotions, rather than progressing a storyline. The second to the sixth world can be entirely explored without solving all the puzzles. Difficult situations can be ignored and revisited later. When all worlds have been completed, the first one becomes available and brings closure to the story.<br><br>The game's concept is entirely based around time manipulation. Tim cannot die permanently as the player can rewind time at any moment and usually for any length, even all the way back when an area was entered. While rewinding, the music is synchronized in a similar fashion. Rather than a gimmick, rewinding is an essential element to solve the puzzles. The different worlds give a spin to the mechanic by introducing clones as the player collaborates in a parallel reality with a past version of himself, time can be affected through the movement direction, and Tim can create a circular area to cause time dilation. Certain items, enemies and parts of the scenery are immune to time manipulation or behave in a very different way. Puzzles require close examination of the environment and the behaviour of different items and enemies. As such, the game is entirely about solving the puzzle theoretically by applying the game mechanics and then using trial and error to executive it and discover possible flaws in the proposed logic. This also brings limited replayability to the game.<br><br>A world is solved by collecting the puzzle pieces. These need to be arranged and eventually show a picture related to the game's story. There is no filler in the level design, meaning that every platform, item or game element (except for a few enemies) has a specific purpose to solve a puzzle. Fast times can be tracked in a separate speedrun mode.<br><br>The later released Windows and Macintosh versions are identical, but come with a level editor.

Description=Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway is the third installment of the Brother in Arms series and takes place four months after "Operation Overlord".<br><br>The player once again takes over the control of Staff Sergeant Matthew Baker and his squads as they take part in "Operation Market Garden". With the goal to secure multiple bridges, three airborne divisions were dropped into the Netherlands behind enemy lines on the 17th September 1944 - one of which was the 101st Airborne Division, Matt Baker's unit. The game tells the story of him and his squad assaulting and securing Eindhoven and the subsequent defense of the surrounding area against the German counter-attacks.<br><br>As in the previous games the player, in 1st person perspective or via tactical map, orders his squad around the map from cover to cover, ordering them to suppress the enemy and planning a flank attack to take the enemy position out, always advancing to the next objective. But to spice things up a bit, there isn't just an assault team waiting to be controlled. In some missions the player gets access to more specialised machine gun or bazooka teams. Especially the latter is very useful now since cover can be destroyed with enough fire power. There are also missions in which the player has control over a tank or has to fulfill the objective completely on his own.<br><br>Like in Rainbow Six: Vegas the player can also now do a move called "Dig in" at each cover. This will switch the camera to a 3rd person view and make the character invulnerable to enemy attack (as long as the cover isn't destroyed). From this position he can blind fire or look over the cover to get the kill with the improved combat system which doesn't rely that much on flanking the enemy anymore since every part of an enemy can now be hit if it's visible. And if the player makes an especially impressive shot (long distance head shot for example), the game switches to a slow-motion action cam, showing the hit in every gory detail. Another change is the new health system. As opposed to a fixed amount of health, the characters now regenerate health automatically if not under fire.<br><br>The game also features a team-based multiplayer mode for up to 20 players in which the teams either have to capture flag points or defend these points or eliminate the whole opposition to win the round.

Description=Eddie Riggs is the world's greatest roadie. When a stage accident causes blood to fall on Eddie's belt buckle, it transports him back in time to an epic age of heavy metal. There Eddie must fight his way through the hordes of the demon Emperor Doviculus to free humanity.<br><br>Brütal Legend is set in a free-roaming world inspired by heavy metal album covers, with the primary mode of transportation around the world being Eddie's car "The Deuce" (AKA "The Druid Plow"). Combat is mostly basic hack-and-slash, alternatively attacking with either Eddie's axe or his guitar Clementine. Through Eddie's guitar the power of rock can summon his car, melt enemy's faces, and even raise ancient structures left behind by the Titans. Many of the main missions, and the multiplayer mode, add real-time strategy elements to the mix. During these missions there are fan-geysers on the battlefield that can be harvested by summoning merchandise booths. Fans are spent to create units that can be commanded and even double-teamed with for devastating results. The ultimate goal of most of these missions is to destroy the enemy's stage before they destroy yours.<br><br>Upgrades can be purchased for Eddie's combat abilities and his car from The Guardian of Metal at the center of the Earth. The upgrades come in exchange for Fire Tributes that are collected by completing main and side missions, and finding the various collectibles around the landscape.

Description=Burnout Paradise is the first installment in the long-running series, well known for its extreme 60-frames-per-second speed and crash-oriented carnage, to appear on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.<br><br>This title does away with menus to create a seamless integration of event gameplay and online interaction. Rather than dividing races into different sections, the player can fully explore Paradise City as an open world, where every junction is an opportunity to start an event. Just pull up at the traffic lights and rev the engine to start an event. The same applies to the Showtime mode (formerly Crash mode). The preset junctions and traffic are no longer present and the player can now crash at any location in the world, by activating the Showtime mode. It can also be used in regular modes, as well as online games. The main game mode has the player earn credit to unlock new licenses and cars. The five main event types are:<br><br>1. Race: the first one to reach the finish wins.<br>2. Road Rage: perform a number of takedowns before time runs out.<br>3. Marked Man: race for a location and survive the attacks from another car that tries to take you down.<br>4. Stunt Run: use stunt moves to reach a target score.<br>5. Burning Route: a unique route for each car in the game.<br><br>There are more than 80 cars present and there is a reworked damage system. More parts can be torn off and the state of the car determines if the player can keep driving or has to wait for a reset. Objects in the environment can now also be deformed.<br><br>The game supports mugshots with support for a camera. When a player is taken down, both players have their photo taken, exchanged and saved on the hard drive. There are also camera-less persons or an avatar can be used.

Description=In Burn Zombie Burn the player controls Bruce against a never ending army of zombies with arena shooter-like gameplay. The objective is to kill as many zombies as possible before he dies, whilst also attaining a high enough score in order to progress. The core mechanic is about setting zombies on fire. By doing this each zombie on fire adds to the overall score multiplier. Flaming zombies are also more dangerous as they run faster and deal more damage to Bruce if they get too close.<br><br>Killing flaming zombies individually as such hurts the multiplier. However, if when a large number of them is killed in one go - via explosives - the score is multiplied by the total number of flaming zombies at that time. It's at this point that the game focus changes and previously innocuous zombie types, like the exploders, become more of an issue as they detonate on contact with fire, thus ruining the scoring potential.<br><br>The game is set in six levels with different themes. Each level also has a unique event that is triggered by the Big Red Button, activated by performing three consecutive weapon combos. There are also four main game modes: Freeplay, Defense, Timed and Challenges.

Unlike MoH: AA these are not only presented from the view of an American soldier, there is a British and a Soviet campaign as well, each focusing on different parts of the battle. In total there are 24 interconnected missions to play to get to Berlin. In each campaign a different perspective is offered, starting as an American Paratrooper during D-Day, progressing to assume the role as an English Special Forces commando, and finally as a Russian tank commander. Some missions are played in solitary fashion, but in most of them the player is part of a larger group with computer-controlled team mates.<br><br>Most of the combat is infantry-based, but some is also set between vehicles or tanks. Multiplayer modes include death match, team death match, behind enemy lines (where the allies are outnumbered) and two objective-based modes: retrieval, and search and destroy.<br><br>The later-released console version Call of Duty Classic is a reworking of the original game with enhanced graphics.

In between, there are cinematics that explain the events. A few gameplay mechanics have been kept intact or make a return: slight auto aim, the damage system that allows you to recover if you hide for a moment, and smoke grenades. New features include the ability to toss back unexploded grenades and actions requiring a successful series of button combinations. This can occur in hand-to-hand combat where you can yank the weapon out of enemy soldiers' hands. Enemies work in groups, try different tactics and search for cover.<br><br>The main multiplayer modes are standard deathmatch (battle), team deathmatch (team battle), Capture the Flag (either with two flags or two sides trying to control a single, neutral flag) and Headquarters (two sides either defend or attack a structure, and players can now respawn after dying). The new mode, War, is similar to the gameplay of the Battlefield series. Two teams start with two control points each, and one neutral flag in the middle. The objective is to control all five flags.<br><br>There are multiple-occupancy vehicles (Sherman Tank, Panzer IV, Jeep, Horch, BMW, Harley), and several multiplayer classes: Rifleman, Heavy Assault, Light Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each class has unique abilities. There are also two rankings: a normal rank system during a single game where your abilities improve if you do well, and an overall TrueSkill ranking. Also, unlike the previous games, your team stays grouped together after a match and is not booted back to the lobby right away.

Also available is a coop-game-mode for two players called "Spec Ops" featuring several missions going on besides the main campaign in three different difficulty-settings with several different objectives including getting from A to B in a certain amount of time. These missions can also be completed alone however.

Miller sits in a hut and has to watch how his squadmates are brutally murdered by Japanese soldiers. But as one soldier approaches him and prepares for the killing blow, an American bayonet comes out of his stomach. Now the roles are turned and in the following operations Pvt. Miller, under the supervision of Sgt. Roebuck, stills his lust for vengeance by helping the American troops drive back the yellow menace in recreations of real missions like "Operation Watchtower".<br><br>The second campaign puts the player in the shoes of Pvt. Petrenko and begins on September 17, 1942 in Stalingrad. Lying in a pool of blood, watching how the Germans put one more bullet in his dying comrades, the private survives and under the helpful guidance of Sgt. Reznov begins his journey through the destroyed city to the main goal: killing General Heinrich Amsel.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode similar to the one from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare with the playtypes Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Search & Destroy in which one team needs to plant a bomb at one of two objectives and the other needs to defend both. The ranking system also makes a return. For every kill or completed objective the player gains experience points and levels up to unlock additional weaponry, attachments or abilities granting a higher accuracy and such. These then can be used to create up to five custom classes in addition to the five pre-defined ones (Rifleman, Light Gunner, Heavy Gunner, Close Assault and Sniper).

Description=What made Ray McCall put down his revolver and become a reverend in the town of Hope? A question Call of Juarez never answered. The successor, Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood tells the story of what happened 20 years ago that dramatically changed the life of a fearsome gunslinger. The story begins right during the War of Secession with Ray and his brother Thomas as soldiers in the confederation. But soon they realize that their family at the farm in Georgia is in danger and they leave the army as deserters only to arrive home too late. Only their youngest brother, William, survived the attack. While he tries to give his brothers strength through faith, Ray goes on a rampage for revenge - pulling Thomas right with him down a dark path that in the end can only lead to the inevitable.<br><br>At the beginning of a level, the player normally has the option to choose between playing either Ray or Thomas. Only in a few missions the game decides this. Choosing with which character to fight his way in first-person-shooter style through the levels greatly influences the gameplay. While Ray shoots first and asks questions later, he can neither climb over obstacles nor use bows or throwing knives for stealth kills. On the other hand Thomas could not even kick in a door if his life depended on it. So most of the time the two need to work together. Sometimes though the characters split up and the mission progresses differently for each one of them. In addition at certain points in the game the two use their coop concentration mode together, allowing them to simultaneously slow down time and use their two different special attacks to take down large groups of enemies. While Ray has to aim during concentration mode to unleash hell on his enemies afterwards, Thomas's cross-hair automatically jumps from enemy to enemy but requires the player to pull the trigger manually each time. Similar to the duels, in which the player needs to draw his gun in one move before he can fire, this is done by performing a virtual backwards pull with the mouse or the analog stick. To limit the access to concentration mode, its "power" needs to replenished by killing six enemies and only holds for a certain amount of time if not used before it vanishes.<br><br>Besides the story campaign, the game also features a class-based multiplayer mode for up to 12 players. While no coop-mode is available, the players can shoot each other in Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Wanted. In Wanted one player takes on the role of a wanted criminal and needs to be taken down. The player that manages to put him to rest then automatically becomes the criminal himself. Manhunt builds on that premise by putting a whole team on the hunt for the wanted criminal for 60 seconds which himself is defended by a complete team. The last mode, Historical Events, pits two teams against each other where one team needs to fulfill objectives during a time limit (like blowing up a weapons cache) with the other team tries to stop them.

The mobs can't wait so Randal has to either pay them $50,000 each week or get killed. The player therefore has to do whatever he can to earn as much money as possible, whether it's through taxi driving, car theft, assassinations or pizza delivery. Failing to reach the weekly payments will lead to game over.<br><br>The game is similar to the original Grand Theft Auto (the development team actually consists of former DMA Design employees). As with that game, it's a mix of a action and a racing game viewed from a top-down perspective, where players get to explore the city either by foot or behind the wheel of numerous vehicles. Cash is earned by doing jobs for the different gangs in the city. For each day the player is offered four different criminal jobs and in addition to these, jobs like taxi driving and pizza delivery are always available. To help the player get to the right locations a GPS is available.

Description=Castle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat-em-up involving knights who need to retrieve a stolen gem and many princesses for their king. Using a hand-drawn style as seen in Alien Hominid, players can initially choose from four different knights with separate fighting styles, along with the alien from Alien Hominid. Other characters (20 in total) are later unlocked or discovered through the course of the game. Although the game can be played by a single player, up to four player can fight together on the same screen in the cooperative game modes, both offline and online. Some elements in the levels can only be activated or interacted with by specific characters.<br><br>Starting with basic moves, defeating enemies fills up an experience meter (up to 99 levels) that provides skill points. These can be attributed to strength, magic, defence and agility and consequently unlock a large amount of new moves and combos. Basic movement includes jumping, a light and a strong attack, blocking and magic. While playing, there are 40 different weapons to collect (included ranged ones such as a bow), each with different attributes. Only one can be wielded at a time, but all discovered weapons are stored at a blacksmith. The different levels are shown on a map where the player can move around and revisit locations. Some are locked until the player is strong enough. There are also shopping areas where life potions can be stocked, along with new weapons. Characters can also move around on mounts such as lizards, when they are captured.<br><br>Another element is the animal orbs. They become available through the game and acts as companions that assist the player, through attacks, defence or special abilities such as digging up hidden items in the levels. As in all games by The Behemoth, there is a focus on wacky humour in the game design and animations. When playing together with other players, after defeating a boss the knights need to fight each other to win the princess' kiss.<br><br>Next to the main game there are also arena fights against increasingly difficult waves of enemies and the All You Can Quaff mini-game where players button-mash to eat as quickly as possible. Through the different playing styles of the characters, there is plenty of replayability.

Now, Richter has suddenly vanished, CastleVania has mysteriously reappeared, and Maria, now a young woman, sets off to find Richter. Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters into Castlevania to find some answers and perhaps destroy the castle once again.<br><br>Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Dracula X: Rondo of Blood. The game is set in a castle which you can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of "special moves" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.<br><br>The Saturn release adds two new areas to the castle (the Underground Garden and the Haunted Path), a third playable character (Maria), and a few new remixed music tracks. However, it sacrifices a few of the graphical effects from the PlayStation version, particularly true transparencies. All other releases are based on the PlayStation version, and do not feature these changes.

Description=The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena includes two single player campaigns. One is a graphically enhanced version of The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and the other, called Assault on Dark Athena, continues the story almost directly after the end of Escape from Butcher Bay with Richard B. Riddick and Johns in hibernation on board of a ship deep in space. A group of renegade mercenaries finds them and brings them on board of their giant ship called the Dark Athena where they transform people into mindless drones. Of course Johns is a too valuable target to transform so they plan to collect the bounty that is on his head after he freed Riddick from the prison. Riddick on the other hand - well he managed to evade capture and is now really pissed.<br><br>As in the first campaign, the player once again assumes the role of Riddick, controlling him a standard first person shooter fashion through the corridors of the ship. But Riddick isn't one who runs guns blazing through the enemies. Instead the dark is his friend. Hiding in the shadows he uses his special ability to see in the dark, sneak up on enemies and perform an instant melee kill with whatever weapon he has currently equipped. This not only applies to his melee weapons that range from his fists to the newly double-carved blades but called "Ulaks" but also to the bigger stuff he'll find on his journey like assault rifles, a mini-gun and such. If he hasn't a gun available, he can pick up a dead drone and use hers. At one point in the single player campaign he'll even take over the control of a full-blown mech to reek havoc on the ship as he did back in Escape from Butcher Bay. If an enemy manages to actually hit the player, Riddick can use NanoMED health units to replenish his health. Since these only have a limited amount of charges he can refill them with NanoMED Catridges scattered around the levels. The bigger NanoMED health units permanently increase his health. And on his way through the Dark Athena he also finds bounty cards, the equivalent of the cigarette packs Riddick collects in Escape from Butcher Bay, unlocking extra content like artworks or personal profiles. <br><br>Completely new to the game is the multiplayer mode allowing up to 12 players compete against each other in several game modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Arena. Butcher Bay Riot and Pitch Black. While the first three are self-explanatory, Arena puts up to four players in small areas in either one-on-one or two-on-two fights while everyone else is spectating and waiting for their turn. Butch Bay Riot on the other hand puts three teams against each other with each team buying their weapons, ammo and armor before each round. With the goal to bring the power node located in the middle of the map to the enemy base, the guards, prisoners and mercenaries don't really fight each other at once. Instead each group has one specific enemy. So the prisoners go after the guards base while the guards attack the mercs. The last game mode, Pitch Black, puts everyone in a dark area with one player playing Riddick with his dual-blades and his night-vision ability and the others all playing mercs only equipped with their weapons and flashlights hunting him down.

Description=The Bible tells us that God created Adam as an image of himself - that is not true. It is also not true that Adam was the first thinking being to walk upon the earth. In the beginning was the Firstborn. The Firstborn was a true image of God. Perfect to the core, a creature with no sex, neither dark nor light and both beautiful and terrible to behold. God feared his creation and left it unfinished, banishing it to the Abyss and created Adam instead with all his flaws.<br><br>But the Firstborn had already touched the Earth. Leaving behind a taint so powerful that even God's expulsion couldn't keep it from breaking through into the mortal world to reclaim it's birthright. In a remote desert in the Middle East the Earth was wounded. Eon after eon the Firstborn continued to fester, breaking down the fabric of reality as human civilisation flourished around it.<br><br>According to an ancient prophecy the Firstborn will successfully break through into the mortal world seven times. Bringing with it diseases, corruption and perversity until seven mystics come and sacrifice themselves to drive it back into the abyss. This has already happened six times. Now once again the ground under the city called Al-Khali trembles as the Firstborn enters the world one last time to either be defeated in a last battle or find eternal freedom.<br><br>During the centuries every civilisation made sure that those seven mystics would stand ready to defeat the Firstborn and this hasn't changed. Known as the Jericho Squad they are now called to Al-Kahli. The city in which one travels further back in time as he ventures deeper into its heart until he reaches the beginning of all.<br><br>The game is a pretty straight-forward First Person Shooter but every one of the seven members of the Jericho Squad has different abilities and uses different weapons. While Cpt. Devin Ross uses the Patrioteer (a combination of shotgun and assault rifle) and is besides Father Paul Rawlings the only member of the team that can heal wounded teammates, Sgt. Wilhelmina "Billie" Chruch is more of a samurai. She uses a Nodachi as a melee-weapon and a rapid-fire sub-machine gun in addition to Blood magic which allows her to summon either a Blood or a Fire Ward.<br><br>Although your teammates do a pretty good job on their own, later on you have the ability to take over one of them and do whatever you want to do yourself. The squad is also divided into two teams which you can give the orders "Hold" or "Follow" which comes in handy if you position one team to cover your six and take the rest with you into the fight.<br><br>The health system is somewhat similar to games like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas or Call of Duty. This means that there are no health packs scattered around. When you're hit you have to search for cover to regenerate. If you are hurt badly enough you'll go to the ground but as mentioned Ross and Rawlings can bring you back to life. The game only ends if you can't be healed fast enough or both Ross and Rawlings are dead.<br><br>As the name suggests, Clive Barker, the maker of the Hellraiser movies, had great influence in the making of the whole game including art-direction and background story but Clive Barker's Jericho is not the successor to Clive Barker's Undying.

Renwick for example is an ex-cop which is rather balanced in the skills speed, strength and stamina. Once the decision has been made, the tournament needs to be chosen. Set for example in a Stahlwerk in Germany, each tournament consists of six rounds. Each round has a different objective. The sprint challenge for example requires the player to race to the exit before time runs out. The siege challenge instead requires the player to survive for a certain amount of time in a limited space.<br><br>But all challenges have one thing in common: The player looks at his character's back and shoots his way through hordes of enemies. For each kill, the player gets points and builds up a combo-multiplier. How many points the player gets depends on how high the multiplier is, where he hit the enemy and if he performed a special action before the kill like breaking through a door or jumping through a window. Each kill increases the multiplier by one but if the player waits too long between kills, it decreases. The higher it was at the last kill, the faster it will decrease.<br><br>The game also features 8 different multiplayer-modes. These include normal Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch as well as modes like Team Fox Hunt in which the teams need to kill the fox of the enemy team in order to win.

Most of the mazes in the game have two different routes; one that is nice and easy, and one that is more difficult. The difficult route always has more valuable treasure in it. So, when you come across a maze you can get through it quite easily, which makes the game suitable for some quick casual play on the bus. However, to get the most treasure and a high score, you have to learn some pretty complex movements that require good rhythm and very high precision.

Description=Alien forces have sent four different comets towards the player's home planet. Now it's up to the player to to capture and secure each comet before the comets are able to do irreversible damage. <br><br>Comet Crash is a tower defense game with a bit of a twist.

This ship allows the player to gather a resource known as Thorium. Thorium is collected by dragging Thorium filled meteors into the player's defensive lasers and turrets in order to destroy them, and then the player can gather the Thorium that comes out. The Thorium is then converted to currency, which is then able to be spent on building more base defenses, and is also used to create structures that make offensive units.<br><br>Defensive units involve gun turrets, lasers, and the like each which can be upgraded into more powerful structures. Also, another form of defense is path blocking, in which the player tries to block the enemies direct path to their base in order to make the enemy go the longest route possible.  This tactic will help the player's defense inflict as much damage on the enemy as possible.<br><br>Offensive units are created from basic ops structures. The four units that can be built from these are scouts, tanks, drones, and torpedoes each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The game allows for up to a 1,000 of these units to exist on screen at one time. Other units can also be built from special ops structures.  Special units such as the hammers, thieves, switches, and carriers help lend support to the player's offensive and defensive strategy.<br><br>The game's main campaign mode comes with 32 stages.

You can rip loose wooden boards with the nails still attached and use as a weapon for example.<br><br>There are also new attacks in the game such as Environment Kill and Chain Attack. Environment Kill is pretty much what it seems like, after beating down an enemy to his knees you can choke grab him and use your environment as a final blow, like throwing him headfirst into a TV, while Chain Attack is like a combo system which is activated when a bar on the screen is filled. You fill this up by beating down a number of enemies.<br><br>Ethan Thomas is working under SCU (Serial Crime Unit) again so his Forensic Tools are back.

Description=Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. <br><br>In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.<br><br>Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).

If there is an even larger creature above those two creatures, the larger creature will swallow them up immediately, resulting in something called a food chain, which gives the player more points. When a smaller creature hits another, larger, creature, the larger one swallows. After two creatures, the larger ones will eventually explode. If you make one creature eat another and give the larger one to an even larger one, the larger one will explode. <br><br>Biggs also has a son, Smalls. He must provide for his son by barfing. In cooperative mode, the second player plays as Smalls. The speed of coming creatures increases by stage, and if the creatures reach the bottom, where Biggs and Smalls are staged, it'll be a game-over.

The collected evidence can be accessed through the PDA to find additional trace evidence on it. Further processing happens in the crime lab where multiple computers are available which are used to search the databases, to compare the evidence under the microscope, assembling broken items or other similar actions. Most of these are carried out through a mini game, e.g. for comparing DNA the player has to match single strings to both samples.<br><br>Other important places are the morgue where Robbins carries out the autopsies and Brass' office where the player asks for warrants or invites suspects for interrogation. To convince Brass or disprove a suspect's statement the player sometimes has to present the correct evidence.

Description=The Darkness is a first-person shooter based on the Top Cow comic of the same name. Jackie Estacado, a Mafia hit man in modern New York City, becomes possessed by an ancient evil on his 21st birthday. The curse has been passed down through the generations in his family to the first born, starting with his great great grandfather. Jackie is about to be taken out by the henchmen of Mafia don Paulie Franchetti when the curse grants him supernatural powers. He is able to eliminate the hit men and goes after Paulie next, as the Mafia don wants to kill his girlfriend Jenny Romano.<br><br>The game offers a mixture of classic first-person shooting with regular weapons, along with the powers of The Darkness. The latter cannot be used in well-lit environments. In dark areas, Jackie can combine both powers. Jackie can switch back and forth during gameplay, and as The Darkness, the viewpoint is placed lower, but with a broader point-of-view. Darkness powers allow Jackie to summon darklings (different types of creatures), summon dark tentacles that grow from his back to break through barriers and smash opponents, along with maw tentacles for close combat. Estacado can also create a black hole and force it to collapse on itself for wide-range damage, and summon darkness guns that fire lightning bolts.<br><br>The game takes place in a modern environment, but also in the fictional Otherworld and Hell. The Darkness manifests itself as a voice in Jackie's head and tries to gain complete control of the body. The force feeds on the dark and requires a live human body to exist.

Description=The Darkspawn Chronicles is a commercial downloadable content (DLC) pack for Dragon Age: Origins and is not integrated into the main storyline but has to be started separately. It is set in an alternate storyline in which the Grey Warden dies during the initiation and Alistair takes his place to defeat the blight. The player takes the role of a Darkspawn who has to conquer Denerim and protect the archdemon. <br><br>As Darkspawns are not exactly known for their friendly behaviour, the DLC consists entirely of fighting through the Denerim city areas. A new talent is used to force various Darkspawn types, e.g. Shrieks or Ogres, into the player controlled party - but since this is a frontal assault the player is mostly accompanied with a larger force which gets constantly refilled. In fact every dead Darkspawn in the party (besides the main character) is gone for good and has to be replaced with a new. This is not desirable because every Darkspawn in the party has an approval rating which brings certain bonuses; similar to to mechanics in the main game. The approval increases with every killed defender and by giving them war trophies which are collected from powerful enemies. These are main or secondary characters from the main game and their death results in a codex entry which shows the different development compared to the main storyline.

Description=It already started to be a bad day for William, owner of a struggling cargo delivery operations, as his old girlfriend shows up and announces himself to his next delivery. So it wasn't really getting worse when the plane crashed after they entered the Bermuda Triangle. But still the cause of the crash was a bit strange - Will could've sworn he had seen an UFO. Soon after he encounters the first robot aliens and unwillingly enters a fight not only for his own but the worlds survival.<br><br>The player takes on the role of William from a 3rd-person-view. On the ground, the game plays much like any other 3rd-person-shooter with William being able to carry two different guns at each time and having grenades at his disposal. Each enemy the player kills will drop tech points which can be used to upgrade each weapon three times to make it more powerful. But storming into a group of enemies won't help Will to survive long even with that kind of fire-power. Instead the game uses a cover-system that allows the player to blind-fire and regenerate his health automatically.<br><br>Not far into the game, the player will get access to a jet pack courtesy of Nikola Tesla who has the unknown island chosen as the perfect place to continue his research. The jet pack opens up a whole new dimension for the player, allowing him to both fly around and attack enemy targets from the air. In addition the jet pack also allows the game to play with the senses of the player. It just doesn't matter that much anymore if he is fighting his way up or down a cliff or which way he's flying through a tunnel. In addition advanced combat options are available while flying through the air allowing the player to make quick turns or skyjack an enemy UFOs after completing a quick-time-event.

Description=Greenvale is a small, peaceful town somewhere in the northern United States. The sudden and brutal murder of a young girl draws the attention of FBI agent Francis York Morgan, a man with an unclear past, a split personality named Zach, and a personal interest in cases like this. York comes to Greenvale to assist local law enforcement in solving the murder, whether they like it or not, but things aren't nearly as simple as they might seem at first. Strange red seeds, a mysterious man in a red raincoat, and the secrets held by those in the town...<br><br>Deadly Premonition is a survival horror mystery game with open-world elements. The player controls Agent York as he investigates the mysterious circumstances in Greenvale. Greenvale itself is a large, open town that can be freely explored on foot or in a vehicle, with a slightly-accelerated day/night cycle dictating when shops are open, when people are available to talk to, and when missions to drive the story forward are available. York himself must eat and sleep (or at least drink coffee), as well as shave regularly and wash his clothes when they get dirty. There are shops and restaurants around Greenvale where items and weaponry can be purchased.<br><br>York has a variety of weapons at his disposal. His basic weapon is an FBI-issue pistol which has infinite ammo, but there are also a variety of other firearms available including machine guns and revolvers, each of which has its own strengths against different types of enemies. There are also a variety of blunt and bladed weapons, including knives, crowbars, and golf clubs. He can also evade enemies by running or holding his breath, but while doing these his pulse rate will rise, and if it goes too high he will get tired and be unable to move quickly for a short period of time.<br><br>Many of the story missions feature an element called "profiling", in which the player must collect evidence in order to piece together what happened in that area. As evidence is collected, the images in the scene become clearer, until all the evidence is collected and York becomes sure of what happened.<br><br>In addition to the main story missions, there are also a large variety of side missions. York can go fishing, as well as take part in time trial races or even play a game of darts. There are missions for many of the characters offering various rewards, and there are also dozens of hidden trading cards to collect. He can also purchase new suits, and even vehicles.

Description=Dead Rising 2 starts several years after the original Dead Rising finished: the experimental virus that turns living beings into the undead has spread beyond Willamette and infested most of the United States. When the crisis became serious, a synthetic drug called "Zombrex" which delays the zombification was released by the pharmaceutical company Phenotrans and sold out quickly.<br><br>The player takes control over Chuck Greene, a former national motocross champion fleeing to Fortune City, rebuilt from the remains of old Las Vegas and yet untouched by the zombie disease, along with his daughter Katey. Katey was bitten by her zombified mother and thus needs a shot of Zombrex every 24 hours to avoid zombification. In order to get his hands on more Zombrex - or at least the money to buy some - Chuck is desperate enough to enter a game show called "Terror Is Reality" where he has to slay the undead for entertainment. Right after the show some of his "victims" break loose into the city, causing a wide-scale infection. Chuck learns from a news report that he is accused of causing the outbreak and that the military will come to capture him and to purge the city in three days.<br><br>Like the first Dead Rising, the bulk of the game takes place over 72 hours, but once the player has completed all of the 'cases' (small sections of story that comprise the games objectives), Overtime Mode will be unlocked and adds extra time and objectives. During the initial 72 hours,  Chuck must get Katey more Zombrex, find a way to escape Fortune City and clear his name of wrong doing whilst making sure him and Katey survive.<br><br>Gameplay takes place in a sandbox-like environment. The player can freely move around in zombie-infested Fortune City and choose how they want the game to progress by either taking on missions (plot-related and side missions, the latter mostly include saving survivors from zombies) or ignoring them. The player can ignore the main story altogether, letting all survivors die, and just fight the undead roaming the streets or go exploring. This will not result in a "game over" screen, but in a different ending. If the player fails to get Katey a shot of Zombrex every 24 hours, the game won't end either (unlike Dead Rising 2: Case 0). If the Story Mode is cleared with the true ending (which requires to complete all plot-related missions, the so-called "case files"), Overtime Mode will be unlocked, extending the main plot.<br><br>Zombrex can be found on various occasions around the city or bought off traders looking to make a fortune off the zombie outbreak. For rescuing survivors, defeating psychopaths (survivors hostile to Chuck) and chopping zombies, Chuck earns experience points (called "Prestige Points" like in the first game) used to level up and gaining more strength, a larger inventory or new abilities (like faster movement or additional combat techniques) in the process.<br><br>The first game was especially known for its extravagant ways of killing zombies. Most of the environment could be used to defend oneself, from regular pistols and shotguns to all kinds of gardening equipment, food (throwing soda cans on zombies) or plastic light sabers that glow in the dark from a kid's toy store - nothing seemed too funky for the developers at Capcom. The new developer of Dead Rising 2, Blue Castle Games, held onto that tradition and introduced a new combat element: the work bench. Chuck is now able to build his own custom weapons by using stuff he finds in places throughout the city. The player may just mess around to find out how to build a certain custom weapon or collect special blueprints to construct them, so-called combo cards. These can be unlocked by leveling up, doing side missions or progressing in the main plot. Custom weapons inflict much more damage then regular ones and Chuck gains more experience out of every killed enemy.<br><br>If Xbox 360 owners have a save file from Dead Rising 2: Case 0, they can import the level, abilities and unlocked combo cards into the Xbox 360 version of Dead Rising 2.

Description=DeathSpank is an action role-playing game by game designer Ron Gilbert. Described by Gilbert as 'Monkey Island meets Diablo', DeathSpank combines the humorous characters and setting of Gilbert's previous games with hack & slash, loot-heavy action gameplay.<br><br>Beyond the expected action RPG mechanics of slaying monsters and collecting weapons and armour, DeathSpank can also acquire Weapons of Justice. By striking enemies with combinations of different weapons, a "justice meter" fills. When filled, powerful attacks specific to each Weapon of Justice can be unleashed. A massive boot-hammer stuns all nearby enemies, the Cleaver of Cleaving strikes all enemies in radius, etc. Weapons and other items (healing and buff potions, food) can be mapped any controller face button or D-pad button.<br><br>DeathSpank features over 100 quests, a majority of which are optional sidequests. Conversations with NPCs use a dialog tree similar to many classic adventure games. Often conversations will allow the player to take wild tangents that are funny, but largely unrelated gameplay challenges. Some of the quests involve solving adventure game-esque puzzles, where non-combat items in the world can be found, combined and used in specific locations or with specific characters.<br><br>The story begins with the eponymous hero seeking for a powerful artifact known as "The Artifact." Coming very close to finally completing his quest, The Artifact is stolen away at the last minute by the minions of a wicked tyrant, Lord Von Prong. But it is soon revealed that a Von Prong actually desires DeathSpank's purple Thong Of Justice. He has kidnapped the local orphans and, as a Hero to the Downtrodden, DeathSpank must rescue them.<br><br>DeathSpank's art style uses a cylindrical "rolling world" with lots of pseudo-2D artwork to create the feel of a pop-up storybook. The world is populated with a number of horrible monsters, from the sneaky greems and chimeric bearalope, to the brutal orques (no relation to orcs) and the dreaded biclops. The game also features local co-op, where a second player can join at any time. They play as Sparkles the Wizard, a sidekick to DeathSpank with a fixed set of abilities.

The other Thongs, however, have corrupted their wearers (who include a nun, a popular TV chef and Santa Claus) and DeathSpank must defeat them to stop the evil of the corrupted Thongs once and for all.<br><br>While the first game was a parody of familiar fantasy tropes, the sequel visits and skewers more modern environments. From a war-torn WWII-esque countryside to the old west, the new environments also include a number of appropriate new weapons. Guns, grenades, bazookas, flamethrowers and even more bizarre weapons expand DeathSpank's arsenal for dispensing justice! There are also over 20 new and unique sets of armour, keeping DeathSpank safe in his quest to uplift the downtrodden.<br><br>The game features more side quests than DeathSpank, with more emphasis of puzzle solving (the Monkey Island half of the equation).

Steve is rumoured to be the long-lost son of Lord Von Prong, raised by marketing ninjas. He rides a pygmy unicorn, wields two swords and a fistful of shurikens, can lasso enemies and heal DeathSpank.. and sing, most operatically. Sparkles the Wizard, sidekick from the first game, is still available for co-op play as well.<br><br>At least twice the size of the first game, DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue concludes DeathSpank's Thong saga by providing more environments, more weapons and more quests, all in the name of Justice.

The amount of points you get depends on how you hit them ... e.g. you get more points for getting them do a 360 other than driving into theirs sides at high speed. The game has more to offer: a head to head mode with only two cars or the legendary destruction derby itself - a huge arena, every car starts at the edge of it, and then - have a nice crash!

Description=Destructo 2 is a simple color-matching puzzle game similar to Mr. Driller, originally released as part of a budget series in Japan. The main objective is to guide a cartoon character moving through an ascending pile of multicolored tiles, pushing the available blocks to create clusters of the same color. Groups of four or more tiles of matching colors can be removed by punching one of the connected blocks, with the vacant space being occupied by the falling stacks on top. The descending tiles that end up rearranged in new color clusters are automatically eliminated and give combo points.<br><br>As the tiles accumulate on the screen, the water level at the bottom starts to proportionally rise, receding when enough blocks are destroyed. The health meter for the main character is displayed below the gamefield, decreasing when suffering injuries from bomb explosions or drowning. The character also dies after being crushed against the top by the blocks. Power-ups and other items can be found inside containers that randomly appear on the pile, that have to be broke open with three punches to reveal their contents. The blue items give bonus points, eliminate all the tiles of a particular color, lower the water level and help in other ways, while the red items do the opposite and have to be avoided.

The murder causes chaos and Sanctus' deputy, Credo, orders Nero to go after Dante, who is heading for Fortuna Castle.<br><br>Nero is equipped with a sword (Red Queen), a revolver (Blue Rose), and powers from his Devil Bringer arm that works like Dante's Devil Trigger. They also give Nero special abilities: pulling and pushing enemies, slamming them on the ground and zooming across areas. Overall gameplay with Nero is still hack-and-slash but with fresh attack styles and techniques. Dante joins later in the game for some levels of his own. His gameplay stays mostly intact with the four attack styles: Trickster, Sword Master, Gunslinger, and Royal Guard.<br><br>The Windows version adds the Legendary Dark Knight mode with a large number of enemies on the screen along with the Turbo mode at a faster speed.

Description=Three years ago a brilliant scientist disappeared while researching a new form of energy. The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk's good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor's private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past.<br><br>Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find "plugs" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors.

Description=For the first time in the Colin McRae-Series, DiRT hasn't it's sole focus on the rally championship. The game also features other offroad-events with vehicles like buggies, jeeps or trucks.<br><br>The main game mode is the career where you work your up a pyramid of different events ranging from normal Rallies over Crossover or Corr to Hill Climb. For every event you complete successfully, you get points and money. While the amount of money depends on the difficulty level, the amount of points depends on your final result in the event e.g. you get the maximum of 10 Points for completing an event on 1st place. These points are needed to unlock new events in the current tier. If you gathered enough points, the next tier will be automatically unlocked so you don't need to do every race in a tier in order to unlock the final event at the top.<br><br>All events feature several licensed true-to-detail-vehicles which also have a detailed damage model. Each vehicle can in addition be tuned in several categories like engine or suspension before each event. To help you make it even more individual, you can create your own look of the car with several dozens predefined kits.<br><br>In addition to the career mode, the game also features the classic Colin McRae-Rally-mode with three different  championship where you need to proof your worth in several car categories like 2WD or Classic. Of course you can also do a time trial, a single event or a single race.<br><br>If you're tired of driving only against the AI, you can go online and compete against up to 100 other players at the same time. An official ranking ladder is also available.

Description=As it's predecessor, the racing-game DiRT 2 doesn't just focus on accurately simulating the Rallye-sport like the earlier installments of the Colin McRae-Series did. Instead eight types of Offroad-events await the player during the main campaign called DiRT Tour:<br><br>1. Rallye - The player has to get as fast as possible to the finish line. He's the only one on the course at the same time and instead has to deal with hairpin curves and difficult terrain.<br>2. Trailblazer - Basically the same as Rallye but instead of narrow courses, this mode features long and open stages.<br>3. Raid - Races over wide and open terrain with many dangerous shortcuts allowing the player to get distance between him and the other drivers.<br>4. Landrush - All drivers start at the same time and the tracks are littered with crazy curves and jumps.<br>5. Rallyecross - Takes place on round-courses with a mix of dirt and asphalt streets.<br> <br>Gatecrasher - The player has a limited amount of time to get to the finish line. To replenish that time, so-called gates are scattered around the track each granting +2 seconds upon destruction.<br>6. Domination - Similar to Rallye, the tracks are divided into sectors. Each sector gives 1-10 points depending on how fast the player in relation to his opponents finishes it. In addition 1-10 points are added for his final position in the race once he crosses the finish line. The winner is the driver with the most points.<br>7. Last Man Standing - As the name implies, the goal here is to race around the course and be the last car in the race at the end with the last car being removed after each lap.<br><br>Each event requires either a different car or at least a so-called race-pack for that car both bought with the money earned by winning these events. Each car can be customized both visually and under the hood with parts unlocked by gaining a level. Experience points are awarded both for finishing races as well as completing missions like jumping over the finish line or getting through a race without any damage. The amount of cash earned at the end of each race, is influenced by the difficulty level. The higher the difficulty, the higher the reward. In addition the difficulty-level also changes the amount of flashbacks that are available for the race (from five to none). Flashbacks allow the player to rewind the action a few seconds when he made a mistakes or crashed and allows him to try that section again - hopefully without making the same mistake a second time.<br><br>The game features many real-world racers including their voices and their cars who give the player tips during the course of the DiRT-tour and also offer him additional challenges including duels and time trials. They'll also take part in team-events with the player, if he keeps them happy by not crashing into them that often during races.

Description=With Andy going to college, Woody, Buzz and the rest of the toys have ended up in a daycare called Sunnyside.  A teddy bear called Lotso runs the place, but it quickly becomes apparent that not everything's sunny in Sunnyside after all...  Disney/Pixar Toy Story 3 takes you through the toys' adventures that lead them to Sunnyside and beyond, as well as places not seen in the film, such as Bonnie's caffeine-fuelled imagination.<br><br>The game features two different modes - the first is Story Mode, which has the toys retelling the events of the movie to their new found friends.  In this mode, players take control of Woody, Jessie and Buzz, each with their own unique moves to help them explore the world.  Story Mode revisits Andy's imagination of Woody in the wild west, lets players play the Buzz Lightyear videogame seen at the start of Toy Story 2, has them breaking out of Sunnyside in a stealth level, and even takes them to a Haunted Bakery!  Each level has secret cards hidden throughout - these cards unlock special bonuses such as concept art, a short making of movie, and best of all, new toys for the Toy Box Mode.<br><br>Toy Box Mode is a deeper experience than Story Mode.  In this mode, players can explore all of the world of Woody's Roundup as either Woody, Buzz or Jessie (as well as Emperor Zurg in the PlayStation 3 version).  In this mode, players build a town for Mayor Hamm using the money they find by completing missions, which can be anything from rescuing cows, to destroying a dam, to taking photos of people or places, to racing in a giant stunt track, to catching bank robbers and throwing them in jail, to pretty much anything!<br><br>Money can be used to buy new toys, such as new town buildings, Micro Machines-style racers, Bullseye the horse (to ride), and even new citizens for your town.  You can also redecorate your town any way you like, using the items you find in toy capsules strewn all over the landscape.  These items can be used to change the look of your buildings, or the citizens themselves - you can change their hairstyle, clothes, or give them a new hat.  Some special missions are given using a ViewMaster-style toy where you look at pictures which give you clues on how to dress up toys or buildings (such as making four citizens look like a mariachi band and then placing them in front of the saloon).

Description=Four hundred years have passed since the last Blight was successfully prevented by the Grey Wardens. Now once again the fearsome Dark Spawn under the rule of the Arch Demon gather and are about to invade Ferelden. The first battleground: the destroyed city at Ostgar where humans and Grey Wardens meet the Dark Spawn to prevent death and destruction before it has even begun. Of course something went wrong and it is up to the player to unite the races of Ferelden and finish off the Arch Demon.<br><br>Dragon Age: Origins is a classic RPG played from the third-person perspective in real-time with the ability to pause the game at any time - at least on the PC. While the console releases are the same in story, multiple-choice-dialogues, items and overall gameplay, they differ from the PC-version in terms of controls and interface and are much more action-oriented. The PC-version on the other hand features extensive tactical options in combat. This includes an editor which allows the players to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Nonetheless the player can also control his party with up to four members one by one, switching between the characters, using their special talents and abilities to overcome the many different enemies.<br><br>During the course of the game, the player will have the opportunity to invite up to nine players to his party. While only four can leave the party camp at any given time, the experience points earned by killing enemies, fulfilling quests or simply opening a chest are granted to each member of the group - no matter where they are, making the player more flexible as every character stays in the same level-range.<br><br>At each level-up a character earns three attribute points and one talent point. The talent point is used to unlock new spells and abilities in the extensive talent tree differing greatly between the three available classes: warrior, rogue and mage. Every three levels the character also earns a skill point allowing him to learn or get better at herbalism or increasing his survival skills. In addition, at level 7 and 14 he earns a specialisation point which allows him to learn two of four class specialisations like shapeshifter and spirit healer for the mage class. These specialisations give instant bonuses to certain attributes and unlock five exclusive talents. But in order to learn such a specialisation, it needs to be unlocked first. This is either done by buying the corresponding book for a good amount of gold from traders or by learning it from another character, may it be an NPC or a party member.<br><br>Of course not everyone is willing from the start to teach the player. Especially the player's party members have to have a certain level of trust and satisfaction. Satisfaction can range from -100 to +100 and is influenced heavily by the decisions the player makes during the game. Talking and giving gifts to the party members also increases their satisfaction. A high level of satisfaction then grants the party member a bonus to specific attributes and unlocks additional quests as they open up and tell their past. In addition it is possible to have a romance with up to two of the party members if the player character is of the right gender and makes the right dialogue choices.<br><br>Although the main part of the game is the same for every character created and will only differ in what the player decides to do first or what choices he makes, the game features six unique origin stories - two for each race (except the humans who share the magi origin story with the elves). They all tell the story how the player's character met Duncan and ended up at the battle at Ostagar and also introduce at least one character that will become very important to the player during the course of the game.

Description=Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening is the first add-on to Dragon Age: Origins. After the death of the Archdemon in the main game, the Dark Spawn have been defeated and driven out of Ferelden. Well, it turns out the victory didn't last long. Those damn demons just relocated to the north and are now threatening the city of Amaranthine and its neighbouring lands. Worse yet, during the six months since their defeat the Dark Spawn got themselves a new leadership: the Mother and the Architect. And those two also bread a new kind of Dark Spawn that are actually able to talk. Luckily the player arrives in the nick of time at Vigil's Keep to defend the castle from the Dark Spawn, take over control of the keep and prepare to deal the final blow against the Dark Spawn. <br><br>At the beginning of the game, the player has the choice of importing any existing character from a savegame of his choosing. The character neither has to have completed the game nor to have survived the ending. The game will adjust the character at the start moving up to the minimum level of 18 or assume he didn't die at the end. Importing a character will slightly change some dialogues and appearances during the following hours but nothing plot-related or really important. New characters, on the other hand, will start at level 18 and be proclaimed to be Wardens from Orlais who have been sent to take control over the region.<br><br>Gameplay-wise, the game remains the same as the original. Using a party with up to three companions, the player talks to people in multiple-choice dialogues to get missions or advance the story, kills monsters in tactical real-time battles, fulfills quests in the five main new areas and earns experience points to level up and gain access to new skills and talents.<br><br>To accompany the higher levels the players are now able to reach, 32 talents and spells have been added as well as two new specialisations for each of the three classes including an extra specialisations point being available at level 22 allowing for three specialisations to be chosen. The three new skills include the ability to craft runes. This is especially important since the new armor runes as well as the new high-level runes can not be found or bought anymore. The only way to get them is to make them out of lesser runes.<br><br>During the course of the game the player can find up to six new companions, two of each class and one being the dwarf Oghren already known from the main game. As opposed to the original however, the dialogues with the companions are now triggered automatically at specific points in the game-world or at a certain stage in the storyline. Romance-options are also not available anymore. Also new with the add-on: two additional tiers for weapons and armor, additional types of usable items and several kinds of enemies including Darkspawn children.<br><br>The PS3 and Xbox360 releases of Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening do not require the main game to play.

Description=Conceptually similar to Pipe Mania, Droplitz is a puzzle game where the player has to guide drops of liquid (called droplitz) through a network of pipes. At the top of the screen there is droppers where droplitz appear from. The goal then is to guide these droplitz to the collectors at the bottom of the screen. This is done by rotating dials to create pathways for the droplitz. Each dial consists of a small pipe piece and these pipes needs to be connected to create the necessary flow. Droplitz are limited and will vaporize when meeting a dead end. When all droplitz are gone the game is over. Whenever a path has been made a purple bonus droplitz appears. When the bonus droplitz has reached the bottom the path is destroyed and adjacent dials will drop down and take its place.The difficulty also increases for every path that is destroyed. A new theme is unlocked for every five difficulty levels reached.  As the player completes levels, the speed of the game and the size of the board increases. In total there are nine boards (levels).<br><br>The game consists of four game modes: Classic, Zendurance Challenge, Power Up and Infection. The latter three are unlocked when reaching high scores in the mode above them, starting at 75,000 points for the Zendurance Challenge mode and then increasing for each mode. In Zendurance Challenge mode the player gets to choose a theme (that he's unlocked) and has to survive as long as possible at a constant pace. In Power Ups player earns different power-ups, that can be used for destroying parts of the board, freezing the board or slowing down the speed of the drops. In Infection mode dials can get infected which makes them harder to rotate, which means they can only be destroyed if a path is made through them.

It largely stays true to the original levels and design from the Genesis/Windows special edition versions.<br><br>One day, in space above Earth, the evil Psy-Crow has trapped a rebel spaceship pilot who had stolen an Ultra-high-tech-indestructible-super-space-cyber-suit, ordered by the evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt. During the subsequent space fight, the suit falls to Earth, right on Jim, who is mutated into a superhero. He overhears the aforementioned antagonists talking about the whereabouts of the suit and their plans with the Queen's sister Princess What's-Her-Name, and decides to embark on a quest to save the princess.<br><br>Gameplay is the same as in the original: Jim can run, jump, float in the air for a brief amount of time, grab on to objects, and shoot enemies with his blaster. In between the normal levels, there are semi-3D races called Andy Asteroids.<br><br>The most important change is the reworked graphics. Everything has been re-animated and re-drawn at a much higher resolution and with a slightly different look, based on the work Gameloft already did on the iPhone version. Other changes and additions are:<br><br>1. 4 difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard, original)<br>2. A new intro cinematic, based on a re-made version of the original comic book story<br>3. New dialogue lines for Earthworm Jim recorded with a new voice actor Scott Shaw, mixed with the existing ones of Douglas TenNapel (the original concept designer, who had no input in this remake)<br>4.

Description=After they had fought out their civil war on their homeworld called Stroggos, the Strogg ventured out into space to conquer other planets and study other races to integrate them into their own. In 2060 they enter space above their next target: Earth. The Global Defense Force (GDF) is completely overwhelmed by the attack of this highly advanced force but they don't give up and fight for their survival. Ultimately Earth will fall into the hands of the Strogg and the events which lead to the beginning of Quake II will unfold but until then, you'll be an important part of this last battle for control over the planet!<br><br>As a successor of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory focuses on objective driven gameplay rather than just capturing flags like you do in the Battlefield Series. This means that on every map one team needs to fulfill an objective while the other needs to guard it. For example on the map "Valley" the GDF needs to build a bridge, then drive a MCP over the bridge to a nearby outpost, hack a Strogg-shield so that the MCP can fire a missile into the Strogg base so that the GDF can enter it and destroy a generator.<br><br>To make it even more complex, most objectives need to be completed by a specific class. On each side are five classes and each class has special abilities. The engineer for example can build the bridge on Valley, repair damaged vehicles or deploy identities while the Field Ops supports his teammates by handing out weapons and deploying artillery systems. Since the maps are all pretty big, you also have access to several kinds of vehicles ranging from little quadbikes to helicopters.<br><br>Unlike most multiplayer-games, the teams in Enemy Territory: Quake Wars don't just have a different skin but are actually completely asymmetrical balanced from classes over weapons to vehicles. This means that while both teams have a medic, they both function differently. The GDF medic for example behaves like every other medic by instant reviving his teammates but the Strogg technician needs a few seconds before his dead companion is alive again. To balance this out, the Strogg technician can turn dead GDF soldiers into spawn hosts. So if he dies, he respawns at such a host (if it hasn't been destroyed).

Monkey, a gifted strong human, manages to escape a slave ship along with a woman named Trip.

Asked why he doesn't just kill her right then and there, Trip explains that if at any moment her heart stops, his will too. This sets them off on a journey back to Trip's village, one where the two must become one as a team in order to survive in a future left uncertain.<br><br>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a platforming action-adventure developed by Ninja Theory. In the game, the player controls Monkey in his escorting mission of Trip. Monkey is equipped with an extend-able staff which he uses in battle. As the name implies, Monkey has acrobatic skills like a monkey that he uses perfectly to climb on poles and escape from enemies. Combat is tied exclusively to Monkey's staff, delivering light or heavy blows and even shooting out plasma shots. While Trip does not help in the actual fighting, she can help in other ways like distracting the enemies or even unleashing a stunning EMP if she is attacked. Trip also uses a dragonfly camera that will scour the surrounding areas for mechs and mines. If any are found, they will show up on screen thanks to it being programmed into Monkey's headband. Tech-orbs found scattered throughout the levels are used for upgrading purposes. These include things like increasing Monkey health, adding more ammo for his staff shots, and even getting new moves. Platforming elements and level design are similar to those seen in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.<br><br>There are three difficulty settings that can be chosen. Playing on the hardest one will greatly increase enemy damage against you. The game contains a chapter select mode to replay any chapters that you have previously beaten.

The player controls a pixel-shaped character through a series of 8 fixed-screen stages, using one stick to move and another one to shoot. The overall goal is to clear the stage of all enemies, but the mechanics to achieve this vary in each level. The same applies for combos and chain reactions. Sometimes enemies cannot be defeated directly, but require a sequence of colors or a special object that triggers the entire field. There is only a single gun with no upgrades or changes.<br><br>Each stage has a different soundtrack toned to match the visuals. All sounds of destruction have been replaced by guitar notes or riffs, leading to a sea of sound that harmonizes with the overall soundtrack, causing the music to be generated procedurally.<br><br>Next to the main goal there are bonus points to collect, used to unlock extras such as extra lives and new graphical effects. Completing a level opens it up in the Single Play mode, where it can be selected right away.

Mankind's vain leads to the construction of the Bioliths, devices of iron to help defeat the gods. After a long war, Jeano, the son on the Source, turns all the devices to rust. Eventually, after a time of re-establishment, four sages found four different nations: fire, water, earth and wood. There is a time of peace, until a mechanical fortress appears in the sky and the Biolith surprise attack wipes out 3 of the 4 nations. The remaining one, wood, receives a message to send a lone wizard to Cape Edgeworth with a single chance to defeat the Biolith Castle.<br><br>The game can played through singleplayer (adventure with a path and different kinds of opponents), head-to-head modes, or online. Through the camera, movement is tracked and the creatures seem to come to life on the screen. Each turn, players move a card, rotate it or change its position. The abilities change according to the position and placing a card face-up summons a creature. While attacking, the screen shifts to a battle mode where spells can be used. The center area is always Biolith, while the others are randomly divided over the 4 different elements, influencing the abilities and providing bonuses or weaknesses to certain creatures. Action are performed through mana, received at the beginning of a turn or through certain cards. The first player to capture 5 areas of the field, wins.<br><br>Neat tricks with the camera include a profile mode where the player can hold a card in front of the camera to view the information and interact with the creature.<br><br>The base game comes with 30 summoning and 4 function cards, and a booster pack with 8 additional summoning cards (5 common, 2 uncommon, 1 rare or ultra rare). Additional packs can be bought separately.

Description=Step into the ring with a cast of quirky cartoon characters, just waiting to beat the stuffing out of you!  Facebreaker is an arcade-style boxing game where you and your opponent duke it out in a set of three rounds until one of you is knocked out.  If a winner is not decided after three rounds, the game goes into 'Sudden Death' mode, and the first person to KO wins.  The game also has a difficult to perform 'Facebreaker' move - if you perform this move on your opponent, you instantly win the match.<br><br>You can throw low punches and high punches, grab your opponent, or perform a strong attack.  By repeatedly attacking with low or high punches, you'll build up your 'Breaker Meter'.  If you hit with a strong attack when the Breaker Meter is filled, you'll perform a Hay, Bone, Ground, Sky or Facebreaker - depending on how full it is.  You can also use the shoulder button to block.  If you block and use your low or high punch before your opponent hits you, you'll perform a Parry, which counters their oncoming attack.<br><br>The game also allows you to custom-create your own boxers.  You can do this either just by using the game's editor on its own, or, if you have a camera, you can take a photo and the editor can use that as a starting point for your fighter.  You can even upload and download other custom-created boxers to see other people's creations!

Description=It seemed like a perfect world. After World War II the USA made rapid advances and technologies. Robots, Hovercars, just everything you can dream of was there. But eventually war raged again and in the year 2077, the dream suddenly came to a halt and mushroom clouds dominated the sky. The lucky people were safely secured in their bunkers called "Vaults". The others, well many didn't survive, others mutated heavily and overall what was left of the world was nothing more than a nuclear wasteland filled with ruins and signs of a once great civilization. Now it's the year 2277 and slowly but surely human kind leaves the vaults and reclaims the lands of Earth.<br><br>The player is one of them. As a member of Vault 101 in the wasteland surrounding the city formerly known as Washington D.C. and now called "Capital Wasteland". And raised in the vault under the tight rule of The Overseer and the watchful eye of his father he doesn't know anything about what's outside. But on his 19th birthday, his father leaves the vault and the player's goal is to go after him. Learning the truth about what The Overseer concealed all these years on the way.<br><br>But before the player can leave the vault, he has to create his character during several phases of his life from birth till his 19th birthday. He decides his name, sex and look on his birthday, decides the allocation of his skill points at the age of 1, gets his first weapon at the age of 10 and takes the famous G.O.A.T.-test at the age of 16. He also gets his very own Pip-Boy 3000. This wrist device contains the inventory, detailed information about his current condition, the quest log and everything else an adventurer needs in the harsh environment of this post-apocalyptic land.<br><br>During the game the player earns experience points by killing enemies, completing quests, successfully picking locks, hacking computers or simply by successfully using his speech skill in the many multiple-choice dialogues with the different NPCs with the goal to level up and earn more skill points. In addition, at each even numbered level until level 20 he also gets a S.P.E.C.I.A.L.-point. These allow the player to take special talents like "Quick Learner" which increases the amount of experience points gained for each action.<br><br>Of course, the many quests often can't be solved without a little fighting in-between and the post-apocalyptic wasteland isn't a very safe place. So the player not only can buy or find several different kinds of weapons (ranging from a baseball bat to a very powerful mini-nuke-launcher) and armors but also has the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.) available. While the player can fight his way in a shooter-like, but stats-dependent fashion through the world, thanks to the V.A.T.S. he can also pause the game and target specific regions of one or more enemies until the available action points are used. After all the actions have been assigned, the game plays them out in a slow motion and very gory cutscene.<br><br>Another important part of the game is the karma-system which is controlled by the actions the player takes. Stealing something lowers his karma, for example.

Description=Fallout: New Vegas, like its predecessors, takes place in an alternate timeline where a war over resources sprouts up in the 1950s and ultimately culminates in a nuclear apocalypse.  New Vegas takes place in the wastes of Nevada, surrounding the eponymous "New Vegas," a paradise seemingly untouched by nuclear devastation that takes its name from our own Las Vegas.  A war is brewing in this territory between the NCR and various "tribes" of raiders, including the Great Khans and Caesar's Legionnaire. The NCR, or New California Republic is a group that wishes to preserve ancient weaponry as well as bring law and order to the wastes.  <br><br>The player takes on the role of a Courier who is assigned to deliver a package to the mysterious and enigmatic Mr. House, the owner of New Vegas.  However once the package finds its way to its destination, a man in a checkered shirt and a pair of thugs intercept you and begin to dig an open grave.  You are shot, buried, and left for dead but are dug up and brought to a doctor in a nearby town by a robot who saw the events transpire.  The player must now find out who tried to kill him/her and why.<br><br>Gameplay primarily resembles its immediate predecessor, Fallout 3 in that it takes place from a first person perspective and has a focus on exploration and immersion.  Although each game begins essentially the same, once the character has molded their characters base stats, traits, sex, and appearance the game progresses in a largely non-linear fashion.  They can pursue the main quest or they can explore the wastes and take up side-quests from various NPCs.  The player will level up as they gain experience through completing quests, doing unique actions, and defeating foes.  <br><br>There are new gameplay elements; there is a larger variety of weaponry and the player can now aim down the sights with guns as well as change the type of ammo their gun uses.  Different types of ammo have different effects on enemies.  The player can also use workbenches, campfires, and reload benches to craft unique items, consumables, and ammunition respectively.  The player also now has an influence in different towns and factions.  Their influence will determine whether or not that faction or town is friendly to them or not, and the players affiliation to some groups may affect this as well.  For example; early on in the game the player will run into a group known as the Powder Gangers.  A nearby town is hiding a man whom the Powder Gangers are hunting.  If the player decides to befriend the Powder Gangers, he/she can reveal the location of the stowaway; however, this will tarnish the players reputation with the town and its residents will become hostile.  Players can also try and fool enemy factions by dressing up as a member of that faction, but must use stealth to avoid guards as guards may see past the disguise.<br><br>There is also a new mode of play known as "Hardcore" mode.  Hardcore mode is an extreme difficulty setting that alters the gameplay to make a much larger focus on survival.  The changes in hardcore mode are as follows:<br><br>1. Stimpaks will not heal your player immediately and will heal over a period of time, and they cannot heal crippled limbs.  Only a doctor bag can heal a crippled limb.<br>2. Similarly, the RadAway chem does not remove radiation sickness immediately but rather over a period of time.<br>3. Players must eat food, drink water, and sleep on a regular basis or they will die.<br>4. Ammo now adds weight and encumbers the player.<br>5. Companions can now be killed in battle<br><br>Besides these additions, the gameplay is largely intact from Fallout 3 and offers little deviation from its style.  As in Fallout 3, players level up, gain perks (although perks now come every other level and instead of starting with a perk, you start with two special traits.)  and can use functions such as fast traveling, waiting/sleeping to adjust the time of day, and fight foes using a traditional first person control scheme (although the 3rd person camera is still an option) or the V.A.T.S. targeting system which allows players to pause the game and target specific parts of the enemies body.

Description=The government in Africa has collapsed and the whole land has plummeted into a civil war with the two central factions UFLL (United Front for Liberation and Labour) and the APR (Alliance for Popular Resistance) at the front. Those who were not able to leave the land now hide in their homes while in the streets death reigns the day. But as bad as it has been, now it is even worse with shipments of modern weapons entering the land despite a weapons embargo. The player is sent into the country to find and eliminate the person responsible for it. Known only as "The Jackal", he has been successfully hiding from the federal agencies for years. Sadly, after the player enters the country he immediately infects himself with malaria. Now he has to fight two enemies at the same time.<br><br>The game puts the player in a 50 square kilometers big area in which he can do what he wants with only the goal to find and kill "The Jackal" and survive the disease. But to do so he needs weapons, vehicles and, most importantly, pills to hold the malaria in check. To get all that he gets missions like escort a weapons shipment or kill the head of police from the various factions and NPCs in the world which increase his reputation (access to better gear and missions) and gain the only currency in the game: diamonds. The world can be freely explored, but taking out certain enemies or visiting specific locations often only becomes relevant when the right quest has been triggered.<br><br>Weapons can be picked up from dead enemies but those are not in the best condition and may jam when the player least suspects it. If the weapon is too badly damaged, it will be destroyed. The player can only carry one of each of the four weapons categories. Vehicles take damage and stop working after a while but can be repaired anytime by the player. If there is no vehicle available to get across the land, the player can also just go to one of the many bus stops in the world to get through the country without being attacked.<br><br>The player is not alone on his shooting spree through the country. Other mercenaries roam the bars and lands and if the player does something for them, they will help him in his missions. Either by giving him tips for the current mission, coming with him and fight side-by-side or by expanding the scope of the current mission to increase the award at the end. These buddies always wait in one of the many safe-houses which can be unlocked by clearing them from enemies. They are also used for ammo storage, saving the game and to fast-forward time to a certain time of day.<br><br>Besides the single player campaign, the game also features a multiplayer-mode for up to 16 players in Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond (a Capture the Flag-variant) and Insurgence. In Insurgence two teams fight over capture points on the map. Once a team has control over all points, the enemy captain can be killed in order to win the round. Each of the game modes also uses a class-based system with six classes like sharp-shooter or rebel (uses weapons like the flamethrower) and different weapon load-outs for each class.<br><br>The different versions are identical, including the editor, except for the save system. In the Windows version the game can be saved at any point, while the console versions prompt to save at checkpoints.

Description=F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin is the sequel to F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon and continues the series' trademark blend of supernatural horror and suspense. Many mechanics from the original first-person shooter have made their way into the game, like slow motion bullet time, and intelligent AI. New gameplay elements have also been introduced, like grab and drag movable cover, combat mechs, and iron sight aiming. The environments are now more open and less linear than those in the first game, and are also more diverse.<br><br>Point-Man, the protagonist of the first F.E.A.R. has been replaced by a new playable character, Michael Becket, a Delta Force operator who has been sent on a mission to arrest Armacham president Genevieve Aristide approximately 30 minutes before the ending of the first game. Alma, the strange little girl returns to give you scares and also assist you at some points.<br><br>The game keeps the original game into account and ignores all events from the expansion packs Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate.

Description=F.E.A.R. is a horror FPS that resembles a cross between Doom 3, Half-Life and the Ring horror movies. Demons are replaced by cloned soldiers and the element of horror revolves around an image of a spectral girl always appearing when least expected for a few fleeting moments.<br><br> The player sets out as a member of a specialized strike force dealing with unknown threats. Initially we start with mundane weapons, which are well presented, and progress gradually towards more sci-fi ones as the danger increases. The player can also call upon a "bullet-time" ability which slows down time around him and is realised with impressive visual and aural effects by the game engine.<br><br> All of the game takes part in a certain multibillion aerospace installation which has been hijacked by an elite team of cloned soldiers gone rogue and an unknown supernatural force (which is likely controlling or affecting them in some way). Both threats must be identified and countered.

Description=The 2008 edition of the long-running EA FIFA football franchise improves upon the gameplay and the features of the previous installments. It is the first game in the series to appear on the Wii and the PS3. Statistically, it includes 620 licensed teams, 30 national leagues (3 more than in FIFA Soccer 07), with the addition of the Hyundai A-League (Australia), Czech Gambrinus Liga (Czech Republic) and FAI Premier Division (Ireland). As usual, the leagues have been updated with new teams and prominent football countries (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain) have multiple divisions. There are also 23 clubs from around the world not featured in specific leagues.<br><br>Gameplay changes include a revised shooting simulation, where factors such as position, defence, speed, bounce and direction weigh in. This is a continuation of the dynamic shooting meter from the previous version, where the position and a shot power meter make for powerful distance shots. There is also more attention to through-balls, more fluent animations and skill moves, revamped crowd, cheering and stadium animations, and a redesigned tackle system. Next to the known modes, "Be A Pro" is introduced where players take control of a single, fixed player on the field. It is not a career mode, but mainly an alternative way to play the games. Online multiplayer options allow players to form a team of independently controlled players, with 10 human-controlled players at the same time in a single match. The camera is changed for this mode, to constantly keep the specific player, but also the action in focus.<br><br>FIFA Soccer 08 contains licensed music tracks from all around the world.

His name is Kenshiro, successor to the ancient art if Hokuto Shinken -- the Divine Fist of the North Star.<br><br>Fist of the North Star is an action game based on the iconic manga from 1983 by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara, and is part of Koei's long-running Warriors franchise. The player controls either Ken or one of his many allies and enemies in one of several game modes.<br><br>The main attraction is Legend Mode, which follows the story of the original manga. Unlike most Dynasty Warriors spinoffs, this mode pits the player as a lone warrior -- sometimes with one or two allies, but often alone -- against waves of thugs, fighting through wastelands and destroyed cities to reach the boss at the end. There are seven missions in each chapter, which include varied objectives like defeating a group of enemies within a time limit, reaching an area before enemies arrive, or protecting a group of defenseless villagers. Each chapter culminates with a boss fight at the end, who must be dispatched by using one of the character's signature moves.<br><br>Additionally, there is also Dream Mode, which presents a series of "what if?" stories for each character. Dream Mode missions take a more traditional Dynasty Warriors-style approach, featuring large, open maps filled with enemy and allied armies, bases to capture, and changing conditions as the battle progresses. Dream Mode can, unlike Legend Mode, be played two-player cooperatively. Any unlocked mission can be played with any character, though only completing a mission with the designated character will unlock the next mission.

Starting from the center, the player can only purchase upgrades that are connected to any other upgrade that has already been purchased. Upgrades include simple enhancements to strength and health, slotted skills and attributes such as attack attributes and faster karma gain, and even additional Signature Moves -- up to eight for each character.

Description=flOw is a PlayStation Network game, originally an online flash project by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark as a part of Chen's thesis research, but later adapted to a commercial game by thatgamecompany, which Chen co-founded.<br><br>The player controls a small, worm-like micro-organism on a bright, two-dimensional plane. On the PS3, it can be moved around by tilting the SIXAXIS controller in the direction the creature should swim. The PSP version is controlled with the analogue stick. There are six, gradually unlocked creatures to choose from (Snake, Jelly, Manta, Rogue, Hunter, Credit Creature), each with their own abilities such as poison, a swirling move to draw in plankton or a homing attack. The aim of the game is to eat other micro-organisms and evolve, moving deeper into the sea until the bottom is reached, leading the game to restart with a new creature. Evolving will change the creature's shape or grants new abilities. There are different power-ups, making the creature move faster or giving it a larger mouth. Certain larger enemies are made up of dots that need to be eaten to have it destroyed, requiring different strategies to take them out.<br><br>With each new level, moving deeper into the sea, the background, colours, enemies and music change. The creature is able to return to previous levels, or dive deeper, indicated by different icons. The game has straightforward controls and offers multiplayer sessions for up to 4 players, all using the same creature.<br><br>flOw applies the concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment. Players can choose to ignore large and dangerous enemies or come back to fight them later, striking a balance between the game's challenges and the individual abilities.

Description=FUEL is a free-world racing game. Players can explore a 14.000 km² area of Northern America after the effects of global warming took place, rendering it desolate with abandoned cities, broken vehicles and almost no survivors. The goal is to win races, which provides fuel that can be exchanged for new vehicles. The game world is divided in nineteen separate zones that need to be unlocked by collecting stars – provided through winning career races. Up to 75 different types of vehicles can be unlocked during the course of the game. The vehicles can be modified with paint jobs and liveries.<br><br>Besides the regular career races, which are restricted to a specific vehicle class like ATV, buggy or motorbike, challenges are another event type in the game. These include for example chasing a helicopter through the terrain or trying to touch other vehicles within a given time limit. Next to the races and challenges that can be accessed right away, the game also offers the ability to drive freely in each of the zones to explore the environment. This is further encouraged by having to locate new liveries, vista points, and doppler trucks that show the locations of all items. The terrain is dense and the appropriate vehicle needs to be selected to explore freely. There are many extreme weather effects, such as pouring rain, snow, thunder storms and even hurricanes.<br><br>The general gameplay is arcade-like. Even though the terrain affects the performance, vehicles cannot be damaged and there is an option to respawn when crashing into objects. The roads are littered with obstacles and the game encourages to break away from the regular tracks to locate shortcuts and use jumps to cross large distances. Players can also create their own tracks through waypoints in the zone. A general HUD shows the race statistics and marks the course, along with a mini-map. FUEL can also be played online against up to 16 players.

Description=Full Auto 2: Battlelines is the sequel to the auto racing combat game Full Auto, that debuted in February of 2006 on the Xbox 360.  <br><br>The sequel builds on the original in many ways by offering improved damage modeling on all of the cars and environments, new gameplay modes, expanded multiplayer, new cars and weaponsn and a new story. <br><br>The game plays much like a mixture of Burnout and Twisted Metal. Each part of Meridian city is a different district with a different graphical style. As you move from area to area, you'll usually have three or four levels that culminate in you earning a new car. In each level, you'll also have the opportunity to complete secondary objectives which can net you extra skins for your cars, new cars and new weapons when you've completed a number of secondary objectives.<br><br>There are two basic types of levels: Racing and Arena. In the racing levels, you'll be tasked with getting from point A to point B or going in a number of laps in a circuit. Levels get complex though as you might have a time limit, a specific car you need to destroy, a car you need to project, or a certain number of level objects you need to destroy in addition to getting to the end of the race. Arena matches are non-linear battle arenas where you'll be pit against a number of cars in a free roaming area. You'll often need to destroy a certain number of cars, a certain car a number of times, or destroy more cars than any of your other opponents. There's a wide range of objectives for you to complete in both arena and racing.<br><br>Back from the previous game is the 'Unwreck' feature that allows you to rewind time. Don't like the way you got killed there? Rewind time. Miss a power-up? Do it over. Narrowly miss killing an opponent? Try again. Just be careful, as it also uses boost energy. Using boost and unwreck at the long time will either make you not fast enough to win or cause you to run dry when you really do need to unwreck.<br><br>Environments are now much more interactive. For example, you can destroy a monorail train's track supports and the monorail will crash onto the race area, or destroy the supports on a dry docked boat to try and make it land on cars behind you. <br><br>The game also has eight player online multiplayer and two player split-screen multiplayer. You can race or fight in an arena free for all or on a team. Online play has two additional gameplay modes called 'Cat and Mouse' and 'Base Assault'. Cat and Mouse will have you protecting your 'mouse' while trying to take out the other teams - attack and defend while your team counts on you for success! Base Assault has you attacking the other team's base while defending your own. To score a point, you need to drive the bomb power up to the opposing teams base to blow up their building to score.

When a charged cube loses emotes, it has to return to the home grid to collect more pellets.<br><br>Grids come with various 3D elements such as slopes and loops. Players can also drop powerballs on top of each other to create a megaball. These provide a hazard on the opponent's grid, such as an asteroid, a shooter, a bouncer, a trailer of a blocker.

But the celebrations did not last long when suddenly "la revolucion" started and all hell breaks loose. Michael and Hyman manage to escape with most of the other family members but Aldo Trapani (the main protagonist in The Godfather) gets killed - just in time for five new families to threaten the Corleone family's control over New York, Florida and Las Vegas. As one of Aldo Trapani's closest soldiers, the player jumps into the role of Dominic to help Michael and the Corleone family win the war as well as to build a family of his now.<br><br>Looking over Dominic's shoulder, the player moves freely through three cities depicting a New York, Florida and Cuba from the late '50s/early '60s traveling between them by airplane. Connected by the main storyline, the main goal of Dominic is to grow his family and destroy the other five families. This is done in two main steps: Taking over businesses and killing so-called "Made Man". Taking over a business is done the same way as in the predecessor: Enter the shop/joint/factory/construction site, fight through the enemy guards and find the person with the Godfather-sign over his head. That is the one the player needs to threaten until he gives up his resistance and pays his dues to Dominic from now on instead of the other family.<br><br>Each business owner has his own weak spot as well as a breaking point. A weak spot ranges from destroying inventory to punching him or her in the face, and gives a 25% bonus on the monetary outcome. But if the player pressures the owner to much, he either dies from the torture or reaches his breaking point. Then he gets aggressive, cannot be intimidated anymore and attacks without mercy. Is the intimidation successful however, the player gets a one-time cash advance and gains money from the joint every day. In addition there are several rackets combined in a crime ring. Once the player controls it, he immediately gains a bonus until he loses one of the rackets in the crime ring. This goes for his enemy as well. When the player takes over a business of a crime ring, the bonuses like bullet-proof vests for all family members or brass knuckles for higher melee damage are instantly removed. That's why the enemy families do not just sit by and let Dominic take their businesses one by one. So the player has to hire guards to protect the businesses. In case of an attack, he can also send one of his soldiers to help in the defense.<br><br>This soldier or so-called "Made Man", is initially discovered and invited by the player to join his family while hanging out at the various safe houses and rackets. Each of them has a specialization. While one might be good at planting bombs, the other is a safe cracker very useful to rob banks and loot all the various safes in the city to get an achievement. As the player progresses through the game, he cannot only hire more family members, but can also promote a few of his soldiers. This allows them to learn a second and even third profession on top of their initial one. It is also possible to upgrade certain skills like Survival (stay longer conscious once out of health) of a family member, in return for hard-earned cash. When a made man is downed by enemy fire, he does not immediately get transferred to the next hospital or police station. Instead there is a time window in which everyone can revive the other with a shot of adrenaline. If it's too late, the player respawns at the hospital/police station and loses some money while his made man is out of the picture for a certain amount of time. This is also true for the player if he has a medic on his team, otherwise he goes directly to jail or the hospital.<br><br>The amount of time it takes them to get back on your side can be reduced by using favors. Favors are handed out by random people with a sign over their head on the streets and by high-ranking officials. Both give the player a mission which can involve killing or beating someone up, blowing a business (even one of the player's) to hell or something similar. The difference is, that the favor of an official can be saved for later like immediately rebuilding a bombed business. Favors of random people instead come in the form of money rewards or kill conditions.<br><br>Kill conditions are needed to get an enemy made man. Just shooting them only puts them in the hospital. To take them permanently out the picture, the player needs to make an example of the man by fulfilling the kill condition. Shoving a made man from the roof of a building, putting a bullet between his eyes and such are examples for such kill conditions. Once all made men of a family have been eliminated forever, the player can deal the final blow to the rival family: killing their Don and blowing up their compound. All while dealing with the police that hunts you down just for forgetting to silence a witness of a crime.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode that ties in with the single player campaign. Upon entering the multiplayer mode, the player chooses one of his family members he has hired in single-player and takes on his role. During his participation in the four game modes Team Deathmatch, Demolition Assault (blow up three objects in enemy territory), FireStarter (torch barrels, gas and propane tanks to rack up scoring multiplicators), Safecracker (bust a safe and hold the position for more points), the player then earns honor points for his family member. These are used in single player to buy a new weapon license for that soldier, which allows him to use the higher level weapons the player finds scattered around the city and can be handed to him.

Description="In the end, there will only be chaos"<br><br>The Ghost of Sparta returns in this final chapter of the God of War trilogy. Continuing right after the events of God of War II, Kratos, the fallen god and spartan warrior, finds himself riding on the back of the Titan Gaia toward Mt. Olympus. Betrayed and killed by his father and ruler of Olympus, Zeus, to give up his power, Kratos returns from the Underworld and decides that he will bring about the death of Zeus by any means necessary. Knowing that the battle against the Olympians would not be easy, he enlists the help of the Titans, the former Elder Gods  overthrown by Zeus and his brothers, to help exact revenge. With nothing much to live for, Kratos will stop at nothing to bring chaos to all of Olympus.<br><br>God of War III retains much of the same form of gameplay as with the previous titles in the series. An action-adventure title described as a "hack-and-slash", you control the main character Kratos as he battles against many kinds of enemies. Fighting is done by pressing different button combinations which are assigned to certain moves. Finishing off an enemy is done by initiating a QTE (Quick-time Event) when the proper symbol appears above their heads. Kratos also gains some new weapons to go along with the old, including the Cestus and the Blade of Olympus. <br><br>Along with the single player story mode, GoW3 includes various extras and modes. Finishing the game once unlocks the Chaos difficulty and also unlocks an assortment of challenges called the Challenge of Olympus. Also, videos such as "The Making of God of War III" and unlockable costumes that grant Kratos special powers can be found in the Treasure section of the game after certain requirements are met.

Description=The Golden Compass is an adaptation of the 2007 movie of the same, which in turn is based on the novel Northern Lights, the first in the His Dark Materials trilogy by British novelist Philip Pullman.<br><br>The game is set in a fantastical parallel universe where the soul of person resides out of the body and lives in the form of animals known as dæmons. The main character is Lyra Belacqua. Her best friend Roger is kidnapped by evil Gobblers and her uncle Lord Asriel is imprisoned when he discovers evidence that proves the existence of Dust particles, much to the dismay of the Magisterial representatives who rule the world as a dogmatic theocracy and do not allow people to contradict their doctrine. Lyra has to leave the safe haven that is Jordan College in Oxford to right the situation.<br><br>In typical 3rd-person action gameplay, Lyra needs to navigate the different environments. She excels at moving around with acrobatic actions and when enemies appear she relies on her wit, hiding behind objects or searching an escape route. When she is spotted, she can use one of the four collectibles to escape from a tricky situation. Health is represented as "courage" and a large extent of courage helps solving the puzzles. She can also play a Deception mini-game to outwit characters and gain additional courage.<br><br>Two other characters provide assistance her during her quest. The first is Pan, Lyra's dæmon and the manifestation of her spirit. Pan can transform into up to four different forms, gradually discovered during the quest. The basic Ermine form allows Pan to chew through ropes and reveals the areas where Lyra needs to solve puzzles or move around. The Sloth form introduces swinging to grab hold of branches or reach areas hard to access. The third form, Hawk, lets Lyra glide from great heights. She can also send out Pan in this form to retrieve objects at difficult locations. The final Wildcat form has Lyra slide down from special surfaces, climb nets and it provides a dash move to evade enemies.<br><br>Brute strength is represented by the second support character Iorek Byrnison, an armoured bear known as panserbjørne. He has most of the physical attacks. Next to health (replenished by bloodmoss) he has an armour gauge, filled up by gathering sky armour. Collected rage orbs fill up a rage meter, which introduces a special attack when maxed out. Pan is always by Lyra's side, while Iorek joins the party later in the game and he is not always present.<br><br>Lyra's journal stores her tasks, information about key locations and a section for the Alethiometer, the golden compass. It is a device that reveals the answer to any question when operated by a trained user. It contains four needles - three to construct a question and fourth for the answer. To ask questions and solve puzzles, Lyra needs to play the Divining game. It consists of three sessions where Lyra needs to match symbols to keep the focus (a circle of light) centred on the device, by pressing a key or button to spin a hand in a timely fashion. The meaning of the different symbols is revealed during the course of the game, by interacting with objects and characters. Conversations often introduce mini-games to keep the talking going.<br><br>Each of the characters can pick up objects that grant new abilities such as new forms, a slow spell, double damage or more insight into the workings of the Alethiometer.

Description=Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the 'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.<br><br>The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.<br><br>The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.

Description=Grand Theft Auto IV is the ninth title and the fourth main game in one of the most successful and iconic series in the history of videogames, and it is also the first title for the seventh generation of consoles.<br><br>Following the tradition of the 3D transition of the series, GTA IV is entirely located in one of the three cities of the original GTA, Liberty City, but now in present time, and with an environment constructed much like GTA III but bigger and more detailed. Liberty City is a virtual city based heavily on New York, where the player's avatar, a Serbian ex-soldier called Niko Bellic, has to gain respect, welfare and power throughout the game. His main goal however is to offer services in exchange for information locate a few Serbians from his past who betrayed him.<br><br>Like in most GTA games, the rise to power of the mobster apprentice begins with parts of the whole map inaccessible. He starts in Broker (based on Brooklyn), and, in order to access the other three districts of the city (based on the other major boroughs of New York City), the player has to make progress in the storyline. To do this, GTA IV has the usual structure based on missions, but with the major difference that, this time, there is not a "mission state" which prevents Nico from doing anything else. In GTA IV, the player can engage in various missions at the same time, and even has free access to the non-mission features of the game while doing one.<br><br>Free roaming is also a defining feature of GTA games. Most of the usual elements of exploration and interaction with the city are included in GTA IV, but they have been enhanced regarding previous games. Niko can cause mayhem in the city, hijack cars, listen to radio stations, observe the behavior of the citizens, enter thematic buildings, work as vigilante, taxi driver, ambulance driver, and much more. But he can also watch television programs or connect to the Internet, look for criminals in the police department database from a police car, walk from the ground floor of a building to the very roof, observe the improved A.I. of the pedestrians, hire taxi cabs to go where he wants, use the mobile phone extensively (like as an event reminder, for example), hire a prostitute, go to a strip club, and a lot of other things.<br><br>In addition, this GTA game is one of the first games using the euphoria motion engine, an alternate middleware solution much like ragdoll physics which makes all people in the GTA IV world move realistically depending on the situation around them. For example, every time Niko enters a car, a different animation will be generated depending on his position relative to the car.<br><br>Some features may be missing (like no drivable airplanes in this case, except for a helicopter), while many others become more complex or are totally new, but, summarizing, GTA IV follows the evolution of the major titles in the series. That is, any new GTA game has more features, is more detailed and is technically improved. The most notable addition for this edition is multiplayer, the first time for the console versions. The same free-roaming environment is offered for up to 16 players in 15 modes. Certain modes narrow down the environment to make sure players remain somewhat in each other's vicinity.<br><br>Compared to the console releases, the windows release features high resolution graphics, customizable multiplayer for up to 32 players, a video editor to capture and edit in-game footage and the possibility to customize the radio station Independence FM with own songs.

Victory goes to the last player standing.<br><br>Players can only build a handful of units, but each has its own defined specialty.  Harvesters suck up resources from nearby tiles.  Armories turn those resources into Walkers, which can move and capture more tiles.  Cannons can bomb enemies or tiles from afar, and Carriers can move units quickly around the map. <br><br>The single-player campaign contains 24 maps with three difficulty levels.  Up to four players can play in local or online Versus mode on 36 unlockable maps.

Description=The heart of GRID is the career-mode called GRID World. Divided into the three regions USA, Europe and Japan, the player has to earn money and prestige points to move up into a higher license category which then gives him access to more and harder racing events. These events are divided into categories like normal races, Drift-events, Destruction Derbies and even the famous 24 hours race in Le Mans.<br><br>But of course not every car is suitable for every event so there are several different series to chose from. So while the player drives a tuned car for the Drift- or Racing-events in Japan, muscle cars await him in for the Destruction Derbies in the USA or Formel 3000 racers in Europe. Each car also handles very differently. Of course the player needs to buy the suitable car first before he can enter a tournament. There he can decide if he wants to buy a brand new car or go over to eBay Motors and look for a solid used car which of course cost less but has already seen some crashes and might not provide the best possible performance.<br><br>To earn the money to buy a car for a event, the player can complete so-called Driver Offers. These are offers by other racing teams to take part in an event and see it through. But there are also bonus objectives like "Finish before Team Top Secret" which grant the player additional cash if he successfully completes them.<br><br>Besides money the player also earns prestige points. These are required to unlock the next higher license category in the corresponding country. Of course tournaments give way more points than completing Driver Offers but the player can also get a few more points by adjusting the realism settings before the race. The higher the realism is, the higher the point gain will be after successful finishing the event. These settings include things like a difficulty level, traction assistant or how many flashbacks the player has available during a race. These flashbacks are similar to the Sands of Time in the Prince of Persia-Series. If the player for example drifts out into the gravel pit, he can activate the instant replay, rewind time a little bit and then immediately reenter the race at that point and try to avoid the crash.

Clear these stages by driving fast to the finish or try to top the times required to obtain bronze, silver, and gold medals. There are also stars to collect and a hidden item on every stage to discover.

Description=Guitar Hero 5 is the fifth main game in the musical rhythm series. Similar to the previous title, Guitar Hero: World Tour, the focus is on a band-experience, with a lead and bass guitar, drums and vocals. The title is available standalone or bundled with the instruments.<br><br>Next to a new soundtrack with 85 songs, many animated lead singers are now modelled after famous musicians such as Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Kurt Cobain, and Matthew Bellamy. Players can still compose their own songs in the included studio and the game relies heavily on downloadable content, through tracks and full albums. A portion of the songs of Guitar Hero: World Tour, Guitar Hero Smash Hits and Band Hero can be imported in exchange for a small fee per song.<br><br>In the Band Lobby players can assemble a party of local and remore players to form a band, play the Career mode or opt for Quickplay. Most of the competitive multiplayer modes are carried over from former versions, along with two new ones: Party Play (random song selection with the option to join and leave at will using any instrument) and RockFest, a band mode for up to four (local) or up to eight (online) players with a variety of submodes. The songs are divided in smaller portions and for each section the players are rewarded based on a variety of conditions.<br><br>General new features introduced to the gameplay include drop-in/drop-out play, where it is possible to join in the middle of a song or stop playing without interrupting gameplay. There is also a new Challenges section in the Career mode.<br><br>The different game versions are identical, except for the PS2 version that lacks online game modes and downloadable content, drop-in/drop-out play and song challenges. It is also limited to two instruments and the multitap is not supported. The Wii version is very similar to the major console versions, including downloadable content on SD cards, multiplayer through the global Wii address book, and the Mii Freestyle mode from the previous game. It also supports interaction with the Nintendo DS to edit videos and provides access to the Roadie Battle mode, similar to the main battle mode of Guitar Hero III, where players complete mini-games on the Nintendo DS to sabotage the players on the console.

Description=Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is considered an expansion of Guitar Hero III and it is the first title in the series primarily focused on a single band. The gameplay concept is similar to the game it is based on. About 60% of the included tracks are by Aerosmith, while the others have influenced or have opened for the band (Run-D.M.C., The Kings, Lenny Kravitz, ...). Four songs were re-recorded by the band directly for the game and they also performed as motion capture actors for their 3D models. The majority of the tracks consists of master recordings.<br><br>The prominent game segment is the career mode where players go through the band's history, from the earlier seventies to 2001. Times of internal issues are not touched upon. Players initially start as Joe Perry but can later also unlock the other band members Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton. The career has been divided into six tiers with five tracks, each based on a period in the band's history. There are also encores when a tier has been completed, and two opening acts playing as another band. After each tier, bonus material is shown such as trivia or video sequences and interviews.<br><br>Songs are unlocked gradually and become available in the other modes, identical to Guitar Hero III (Quickplay, Cooperative, Competitive + Battle modes). Only the cooperative career mode is absent. The menus have been redesigned and there are new venues, based on historical performances. There are 41 songs in total, of which 31 can be unlocked in the career mode and an additional 10 in the vault.<br><br>The game is available in a bundle with a custom guitar or as a single game release. For the PS2 version there are two bundles, one with a single, wireless guitar and another with two, wired guitars.

Description=Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the third full game in the Guitar Hero series and fourth game overall. The gameplay remains similar to the previous games: using a guitar-shaped controller, you need to coordinate pressing the five fret buttons and strumming to the scrolling notes on screen. Missing notes will cause your performance meter to drop; if the meter drops too low then the performance is a failure and you will need to try again. This edition of the game features 71 new songs to play from various artists including Cream, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Santana, Sonic Youth, Weezer, and many more. In addition to the available songs the game also features &quot;boss battles&quot; against famous guitarists such as Slash, Tom Morello and Lou the Devil. Several game modes are available including career mode, co-op mode, and multiplayer mode. In addition to the main game modes, training and practice modes are available to aid in learning the game or figuring out a tricky passage in a song.<br><br>In career mode you play the part of a wanna-be rock star. Beginning with easier songs in small venues, you need to successfully complete tracks to make your way up to a superstar. Each venue you play requires a certain number of songs to be performed before you can move on to the next larger venue. Successful completion of songs also earns money which can be used to unlock characters, outfits, new guitars, and other bonuses.<br><br>The co-op career mode is similar to the single player variation, except two players work together (one on lead guitar, the other on bass or rhythm guitar) to complete songs. <br><br>The multiplayer game modes allow two players to compete against each other. In the Face-Off variation, two players take turns performing a song. The Pro Face-Off variation allows two players to compete at the same time playing the exact same note chart. Finally, in the battle mode each player can earn power ups by performing well which can be used to disrupt the other player.

Description=Guitar Hero: Metallica is the second game in the Guitar Hero series to focus on specific band, following the release of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith.<br><br>This title largely borrows from the novelties introduced in Guitar Hero: World Tour, with band career modes for single or multiple players with a storyline drawn as a cartoon, competitive modes online, and the possibility to play with different instruments such as a regular guitar, a bass guitar, drums, and doing the vocals. The storyline describes how a band wants to follow in the footsteps of the Metallica and become a leading act on their tour. This edition adds an Expert+ difficulty mode where players need to drum using a second bass pedal to mimic the playing style of Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band. The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.<br><br>The music selection consists of 28 master recordings and 21 additional songs by others selected by the band. Bonus features include various videos and trivia about the songs. Progress is made by completing sets of songs, rather than a series of gigs as in Guitar Hero: World Tour, set in venues that were in important in the band's career. Performances are rated with stars and a certain amount is needed to progress and unlock a new set.<br><br>The game also includes the GHTunes from World Tour where new songs can be created and shared. A new Drum Mode offers the possibility to play the drums without an existing drum track to create new rhythms, and the Battle mode (from Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock), has been updated with Metallica influences for the power-ups, with names like Fade To Black, Under The Ice and Ride The Lightning.<br><br>Although released in Europe packaged with a guitar controller and Metallica faceplate, other regions were not so fortunate and only received a solus edition. Custom drumsticks and a second bass pedal were offered as pre-order bonuses in certain stores.<br><br>The Metallica tracklist includes:<br><br>1. All Nightmare Long<br>2. Battery<br>3.

Description=Guitar Hero: World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.<br><br>While playing, a rock meter keeps track of successive notes hit (one for each player), which leads to score multipliers. When the meter becomes too low, other players can make up for this on a shared, general performance meter. In the same vein players share a star power meter, built up by playing through certain sections successfully, that any player can access.<br><br>There are four difficulty levels and a new beginner mode where notes are made as easy as possible to introduce the concept to new players. Most of the game content is centered around a Career mode (both Solo and Band) where players start a new band, choose an avatar an instrument, and then play different gigs unlocking new songs along the way. Completing tracks earns money that can be spent on outfits or instruments. There are once again encore songs and "boss challenges" where the lead guitar enters a duel. This is similar to the battles in Guitar Hero III, but without the power-ups. Instead it returns to a call-and-response mechanic similar to the Face-Off mode. Bands consists of offline players but online members can join as well. Complete bands can take on others online through the Battle of the Bands mode.<br><br>Through the Music Studio editor new songs can be composed and shared using the GHTunes service (not for the PS2). In this edition avatars can be customized with more detail using the Create-a-Rocker mode. Major artists have licensed their appearance in the game. The Wii version contains a Mii Freestyle mode where players can use their Mii characters in-game and compose songs through motions of the Wii remote and the Nunchuk controller.<br><br>There are several bundles for the game, based on the amount of instruments included, but also a stand-alone version as most of the versions are compatible with the controllers of previous games and even some of Rock Band.

In the "Animal Kingdom", the King Lion has disappeared after being implicated in a series of scandals and as a result, animals across the kingdom demand a new king by holding an election.  The election becomes a stalemate, leading the lowliest form of animals, Clams, with the deciding vote.  As a result, each candidate must compete in a free-for-all to get the Clam vote and become the new president.<br><br>The gameplay mostly consists of competing on themed party boards, such as ships, a volcano and a snowy tundra, collecting clams to score points and raise their overall vote count while avoiding obstacles and attacks from rival opponents.  The results of each contest are showed in a news-themed stats screen, showing overall stats presented by animal newscasters such as a turtle and a woodpecker named Woodchuck Chumley.  Players can also form alliances after certain stages and recruit rival candidates to help them in later stages, only later to turn against them as well.<br><br>There are ten animals to choose (a hippo, armadillo, polar bear, octopus, platypus, and the game's namesake chimp) in the multiplayer mode, which has four human opponents competing against each other, but in the single-player "Campaign" mode, the player competes in ten stages, each themed for a certain animal during the game, competing in a series events aimed towards that character that they are controlling. There are also four opponents during the "Campaign" mode, but instead has three CPU opponents in place of human opponents.

The player takes the role of Harry Potter who has to fight against Lord Voldemort and his minions. <br><br>The game is not completely linear - between the chapters Harry can explore the school at his own leisure. If the player does not want to walk and search around, they have two ways to cut a corner: portraits, which are unlocked during the course of the game, can be used to teleport instantly to another place. Harry can also call a ghost which shows him the fastest way to the next mission. Exploration has mostly one goal: finding the 150 (more or less) hidden crests which unlock achievements and trophies. Because Harry lost his ability to jump and climb, he has to use spells to reach them.<br><br>Mini Games<br>The player will spend most of his time in three mini games: magic duels, brewing potions, and quidditch. The duels are used to learn new spells respectively improve the already known. Harry basically faces other magicians and uses his spells to defeat them, e.g. by paralyzing them or by parrying their spells. To perform a spell the player has to use his input device to recreate a certain movement.<br><br>Quidditch is a reaction test. Harry's broom flies automatically and the player can only slightly move it to fly through rings or avoid obstacles. While brewing potions Harry faces a bowl, ingredients and a time limit. Now he simply needs to recreate the receipt by using the ingredients in the correct on the bowl. Sometimes he needs to heat up the bowl or stir the brew up with his input device. If he makes a mistake there is smoke which costs time.

Description=Haze is a first-person shooter centered around Shane Carpenter, a young soldier in Mantel's army. Mantel controls the world's largest and most powerful PMC, supplying all of his soldiers with a drug known as Nectar, boosting their combat abilities.<br>After sending out Carpenter and his squad to the Boa Region of South America, in order to neutralize The Promise Hand, a group of rebels inhabiting the region, he soon finds out his mission is not what it appears to be. After an unexpected twist of events, Carpenter finds himself on the rebel's side, fighting against his former comrades.<br><br>The two factions fight differently: as a Mantel soldier the player has the option of using Nectar, thus making targeting and aiming more precise and powering the player's melee attacks. After realizing that the Mantel army's goal of achieving peace is only a lie fed to the brainwashed soldiers, the player has different fighting abilities among the rebels, like playing dead, laying grenade traps and being able to cause Nectar overdoses on Mantel troops. These overdoses make the soldiers berserk, disorientate them and make them unable to distinguish friend from foe.<br><br>The single-player campaign also features a cooperative option to play along with three friends. The multi-player features deathmatch, team deathmatch and an objective based assault mode.

Description=Invincible Tiger is a side-scrolling fighting game designed to look like a 70's Kung-fu movie. The game area is rather confined however, as it looks more of a movie stage set where Han Tao can only move left or right for a limited distance. The area consists of different levels. Certain objects are highlighted in red and with a press of the button Han Tao can interact with them, climbing up pillars and trees, kicking a bucket towards an enemy or swinging from a branch. The 15 settings include locations such as ships, houses and dojo's. Fighting is done with two buttons to kick and punch, and combining them forms combos. Holding the left stick lowers the height of the attacks. The right stick is used to evade attacks, by dodging and rolling, which is especially useful when enemies approach from both sides. When Han Tao dodges too much, he becomes dizzy and needs to rest for a short while. Next to the environmental attacks there are also different weapons such as swords that can be picked up.<br><br>There is a Ying Yang meter at the top of the screen that is balanced by landing attacks (white) or blocking attacks or taking damage (black). They can be refilled by collecting health (Evil Souls) or meditating, a short period where Han Tao is vulnerable to attacks. Once the levels are high enough a Hyperstate mode can be activated where he moves faster and attacks become more powerful. Certain enemies are shown as marked men, identified by masks floating over their heads. Defeating them before they disappear provides Han Tao with his souls, which re-charges his health automatically, and up to five can be collected at a single time. Souls can also be dropped in front of an idol. When three are collected that way, a form of supernatural energy is unleashed. The game also contain five bosses that require a more tactical approach to defeat them.<br><br>Multiplayer supports a co-operative mode for two players, both locally and online. Each player has a separate health bar, but the lives and Ying Yang meter is shared. When one player is low on health, he will automatically attract the attention of enemies who try to target that player first. In singleplayer there is a main Story mode, along with Time Trial, and Endurance (an endless wave of enemies). <br><br>The game supports different 3D modes.

Description=Although James Cameron's Avatar: The Game is named after the movie, the story itself doesn't follow the plot of the film. Instead the player takes on the role of Lance Corporal Ryder, a signal-specialist who is send to the distant moon Pandora. But Ryder isn't just any other soldier. Instead he or she is one of the selected group of people that take part in the so-called Avatar-program. Avatars are a hybrid of Na'vi DNA and human DNA that have been created in order to better interact with the inhabitants of the planet: the Na'vi, tribe-like and technology-wise not very advanced people that are one with nature. Although the Na'vi are friendly to the new-comers at first, soon the humans want more than just diplomatic relations. They want to relocate the Na'vi in order to be able to strip the planet of its natural resources. A war breaks out which only one side can win - it is up to the player which it will be.<br><br>Early in the game the player has to decide weather he wants to help the Na'vi unlock the power of the Well of Souls or if he wants to stay with the humans. Depending on his choice, the gameplay changes significantly:<br><br>1. Human: As a human the player can enter buildings, drive vehicles like buggies and helicopters and use full-body armor as well as several different kinds of firearms including shotguns and flamethrowers. In addition Pandora itself is against him meaning both plants and animals will attack the player but will also grant experience points. As a human the player can build pods that replenish ammo and health a specific locations.<br><br>Na'vi: The Na'vi are more than two meters high and as such can neither enter buildings nor use humans vehicles. But Pandora herself is friendly so plants and animals won't attack (or give experience points for that matter) allowing the player to ride strange horses or fly around on huge dinosaur-like creatures. While the player himself is able to use a machine gun, normally the Na'vi rely on bows and arrows as well as strange swords and staves. If the player manages to pull of a five-hit-combo, a special attack comes available. Na'vi harvest plants in order to get arrows and cell samples.<br><br>Both characters have in common, that they are controlled in a standard 3rd-person-shooter-fashion and have to collect DNA/cell samples. Once enough have been collected, the player gains the ability to get right back into the fight after his hit-points reach zero. Only if not enough samples have been collected will the player re-spawn at the nearest outpost. Also both parties earn experience points for completing quests and killing enemies. Once enough points have been collected, the character levels up and get's access to new weapons and spells allowing him to make himself invisible for example.<br><br>Pandora is divided into several sectors and each sector features several challenges like lifting 100% of the fog of war or collecting a certain amount of cell samples. Fulfilling these objectives grants additional experience points. To further help the player in his quest, a world-domination-mini-game is available at each transporter. This mini-game is turn-based and has the player starting out with only one sector and the goal of conquering all the other. Doing so will grant his character additional experience points, increase his weapons strength and such. Money for building bases and ordering troops on the other hand is earned by playing through the normal campaign. To conquer enemy sectors, three types of units are available that can only be build at a base. Combat is a simple numbers game and plays out automatically. To defend conquered sectors, a defense building for each type of unit can be build.<br><br>The game offers five team-based multiplayer-modes: King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch, Capture and Hold (capture control points in order to make the enemies team loose victory points) and Final Fight where the RDA has to protect three missiles in their base while the Na'vi have to destroy them.

Description=Joe Danger is a motorcycle stunt racing game similar to Excitebike and Trials HD, but with a cartoon look. Players control daredevil Joe Danger during his comeback after being out of commission for many years following a serious crash. He has to complete different levels filled with obstacles, progressing through a career mode. Each level has one or more specific objectives that can be completed in different sessions, such as finishing within a certain time, collecting all stars, coins, or the letters of DANGER, continuously performing combos, activating all targets, finding hidden stars, or beating all opponents. Completing these objectives is rewarded with gold stars that are used to unlock new challenges. Not all objectives on all levels need to be completed to progress. There also some special levels where Joe needs to launch himself to knock over bowling pins, similar to a mode from the Flatout series. While in the air aftertouch can be applied to parachute or cannonball.<br><br>The gameplay is very arcade-like. The R2/L2 buttons are used to speed up and down, Joe can duck, and jump over obstacles, and activate boosts. Ramps are used for jumping over cars or shark-filled pools and in mid-air Joe can performs stunts such as supermans and cowboys, or many consecutive spins. Even though the focus is on speed, it is possible to backtrack and there are slower sections with launch pads and hidden areas, introducing platform and exploration elements. Joe is able to jump and double jump (combined with boost) to reach higher areas. There are checkpoints to restart a certain section when crashing. Performing stunts along with wheelies keeps the boost meter filled to perform more dangerous stunts, encouraged by the cheering of the public. There are also race sequences against other opponents who can be knocked down.<br><br>Racing is done in a single line through levels, but at special junctions it is possible to swerve into another lane, with different layers to the level layout, similar to LittleBigPlanet. Items and objectives are often divided over different racing paths, so levels sometimes need to be replayed multiple times to complete all objectives. There are also separate sandbox levels to perform stunts without direct objectives.<br><br>The game comes with a built-in editor where new courses can be designed (also for split-screen multiplayer) and they can be shared with friends. There is however no central hub where all user-created tracks are gathered and rated. Editing can even be done while racing, dropping objects and changing the course while Joe is driving. Sometimes the editor needs to be accessed in the career mode to alter or remove obstacles in order to complete the levels. Multiplayer is supported both locally (split-screen) and online, with many different game modes.

Description=A new triad gang called the Golden Kane is gaining strength in Hong Kong and starts to openly threaten the Dragon Claw with it's leader James Wong, the oldest and most powerful clan. His daughter Billie Wong once had a relationship with a cop and got pregnant with Teko. One day both get kidnapped by the Zakarov Syndicate. The name of the cop which got Billie pregnant is Inspector Tequila. He is a veteran Hong Kong cop which doesn't really work by the book but has his heart in the right place. When a cop gets kidnapped (and killed) by the Golden Kane, Tequila starts investigating against the orders of Captain Ed Lee.<br><br>You take on the role of Tequila and not only get the copkillers but also unwillingly help the Dragon Claw because of Billie and her daughter. But the task isn't an easy one since hundreds of enemies stand between him and his goal which mostly end in killing a boss or blow stuff up.<br><br>To deal with all those bad guys Tequila has not only his fists and his trusty Enforcer (dual wield pistols) but also gets access to machine guns, shotguns, grenades and rocket launchers. But this won't be enough either. To give Tequila the ultimate advantage he also has access to Tequila Time and Tequila Bomb.<br><br>Tequila Time is like the Bullet Time in Max Payne. It slows down time and allows Tequila to better react to the situation. You can either activate it manually or it gets activated automatically if you perform a jump or interact with your environment. You can slide over tables, role around on carts, run up stairrails and kick over tables to use as cover.<br><br>The Tequila Bomb are super moves like a Health Boost or a Spin Attack (white doves included). To fill up your Tequila Bomb Gauge, you either need to find hidden Origami Cranes or earn Style Points.<br><br>You gain Style Points if you kill your enemies during a Tequila Time move or by using your surroundings. If you are fast enough you gain Style Combos which not only fill up your Tequila Bomb Gauge faster but also multiply your Style Points. These Style Points can then be used to unlock all sorts of concept art from the main menu.<br><br>Since John Woo greatly influenced the development, you also take part in Mexican Standoffs. In these you are surrounded by some enemies and Tequila takes them on one by one but he can only lean to left and right to dodge the incoming bullets.<br><br>The game also features an online multiplayer mode with statistics. The two available game modes are Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch for up to 6 players.

Description=Rico Rodriguez is back! After liberating the small Island of San Esperito, the CIA-agent is on his way to the island paradise Panau to find a former colleague: Agent Tom Sheldon. During an undercover-investigation, he vanishes and with him two million dollars. Money, the Agency desperately wants back, especially as they believe that Tom changed sides. So Rico has to infiltrate the criminal organisations of Panau as Scorpio to flush out Tom Sheldon and bring him to justice while plunging the country into chaos - but that's more of a bonus than a real objective...<br><br>Like its predecessor Just Cause, the game drops the player on a huge island. From the start, the whole island is open to be explored by the player in a third-person-shooter-fashion either on foot, by using several dozen different cars or even by using heavily armed helicopters and fast planes. The player is totally free to do what he wants, although that mostly breaks down to reeking havoc and causing chaos by destroying statues, fuel tanks and other military-owned stuff. This way the player earns points which in turn progresses the story, unlocks missions and gives him access to additional stuff from the black market. In addition all over the island crates are hidden containing both money and upgrade parts. Once the black market helicopter has been called via a beacon, the player can order weapons, vehicles and even request a transfer to another location on the island for free. Weapons and vehicles on the other hand cost money and are dropped right on the spot where Rico called. They can also be improved using the upgrade parts the player collected.<br><br>In addition to his weapons, Rico's two most useful tools are his parachute and his grappling hook. The parachute can be activated at almost anytime, even if the player is driving at high speed along the road, and is very useful to make combo-stunts. And this is where the grappling hook comes in: with it, the player can either pull enemies towards him, or pull himself towards a target - which can either be a house two streets away, or a moving car. The latter allows for example high-speed-car-jacks which in some cases result in one of the two types of simple Quick-Time-Events in the game. The other type pops up when Rico tries to unlock a gate or disarm a bomb or such. Although the grappling hock was already featured in the first game, this time around it's a dual-hook. If the player has hit something with his hook, he can put the other end on another object - again no matter if it's a solid or moving object or a random human who had the bad luck of being nearby. This allows the player for example to hook a car to a helicopter, fly over an enemy base and drop the car onto the poor soldiers.<br><br>To keep the action focused even outside the main storyline, challenges like checkpoint-races and optional missions are scattered around the map and each settlement on the island can be cleared 100% by destroying all worthy targets and collecting all crates in the vicinity.

Description=Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is the sequel to the 2007 game Kane & Lynch: Dead Men. This time the player takes on the role of the medicated psychopath, Lynch. The setting is moved to Shanghai, where Lynch has moved to and has set up an arms deal with a British crime boss that will help him retire once and for all. Although Kane is there to help him out, the deal goes bad. The game takes place in the ensuing 48 hours.<br><br>As in the predecessor, gameplay revolves around cover-based combat, which is now activated manually with a button, as opposed to the automatic 'sticky' method used before. The player now also has the ability to grab human shields and use them as portable cover. In addition to this, there is a new throwing mechanism to hurl things at people. As such it is possible to throw things like gas canisters in clusters of enemies, which can then be shot and detonated. Last but not least, the player can carry two weapons at once.<br><br>The campaign can be played through in co-op mode with a friend on split-screen, or on dedicated servers; the second player assumes the role of ex-military man Kane. In addition to co-op, several other multiplayer modes are also supported. Fragile Alliance makes a return from the first game and allows a team of four to eight players to perform bank robberies, which consist of taking out the guards, breaking into the vault and making a getaway. Score is based on how much money the player personally gets away with, creating a recipe for betrayal. The Undercover Cop mode is a variation on the previous mode, in which one of the robbers is actually an undercover cop who must prevent the robbers getting away with the loot. The undercover player cannot be harmed by the security personnel, and cannot kill them either. The final mode is Cops and Robbers, which has two teams pitted up against each other, one taking the role of cops, the other taking the role of the robbers. The robbers should attempt to get the money and the cops should attempt to stop them. At the end of each round, the teams will swap places, and whichever team gets away with the most money wins.

While Lynch already knew that this would happen, it is only later revealed to Kane that the attackers were his old associates which he presumed dead. Now they demand the money from the last coup they did together from Kane. Since Kane has nothing to lose, they took his family hostage in order to force him to get them their money fast. To make things even worse, they hired the medicated psychopath Lynch to be his watchdog.<br><br>From the moment the transport is hit, you take control over Kane and try to free your family. The camera is placed behind Kane while moving and you can also zoom into a over-the-shoulder view while firing. Kane will automatically take cover where it is possible and if he is too badly wounded, he needs a teammate to give him a shot of adrenaline to get him back into the fight. But don't do that too often in a short period of time or your heart will collapse with an unfortunate end.<br><br>Of course nothing goes as planned so most of the time is spent shooting your way through hordes of police and special forces. To deal with them you can carry two different types of weapons ranging from pistols to assault rifles and shotguns.<br><br>You can also give Lynch commands like focusing his fire on one enemy, trading weapons with him and getting ammo when you are out of it. During the course of the game you are sometimes accompanied by other members of the organisation with whom you can interact in the same way as with Lynch.<br><br>The game features an offline coop-mode in which the second player takes over the control of Lynch. The online multiplayer consists of a game-mode called "Fragile Alliance" in which the players need to rob a bank. The twist is that you can attack at any time, kill your teammates and take the money they had already collected. You will then be marked as a traitor for the whole team and those that get killed will respawn as one of the police force and work against the whole team.

The game is played entirely from the first-person perspective, except for the portions with vehicular combat with a tank and an exoskeleton. A large portion is dedicated to seeking cover and peeking from behind objects to open fire. Next to the single-player campaign, there is squad-based multiplayer called Warzone with five different kinds of missions (Assassination, Search & Retrieve, Search & Destroy, Bodycount and Capture & Hold) based on seven kinds of classes. There is support for up to 32 players, with the addition of bots to fill the remaining spots.

Description=Continuing the tradition of adapting known franchises such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones with visuals based on LEGO, this game takes on the Batman universe. The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth. <br><br>It is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles.<br><br>Both characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode.<br><br>In the second part of the game players take control of the different villains such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush, Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though they can die, they immediately respawn.<br><br>Multi player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions allow drop in/drop out co-op. The PSP release fares worst of all and does not contain any kind of multiplayer option.

Description=LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 is the first installment of the Harry Potter series in LEGO form. Spanning the first four years of the Harry Potter franchise, players take control of a wide variety of characters and relive famous moments from the first four books; Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Goblet of Fire. Almost all of the game takes place inside Hogwarts.<br><br>The Story mode is broken up into four years with six chapter per year. When you first play story mode you are required to play as certain characters that are part of that story and you cannot choose any character from the entire series. But once you beat that chapter a Free Mode is unlocked, allowing you to pick any unlocked character and replay that story. All story chapters and years can be accessed in The Leaky Cauldron which acts as the central hub in the game. The entire environment allows for continuous play and most places can be revisited at any time. Many of the characters' interactions change however based on the time of year, or when certain characters are introduced such as the Dementors or Gilderoy Lockhart.<br><br>Outside of The Leaky Cauldron is Diagon Alley. In Diagon Alley you can head to other stores to obtain items and supplies. At Madam Malkin's Robes you can spend all of your hard earned studs (the currency) to buy new characters. At Eeylops Eye Emporium you can head upstairs and buy Red Bricks which contain cheat codes of sorts to use. And at Wiseacre's Wizarding Supplies you can buy fun new spells to cast on anybody you like. Casting spells is an important part of the gameplay and is accessed by a spell wheel in which you can choose many ranging from Wingardium Leviosa to the dreaded Aveda Kedavra (only the three versions of Voldemort can use this).<br><br>LEGO Harry Potter adds to the replay value by having a bunch of collectibles for you to obtain. If you want to get 100% completion you're going to have to do things such as find and purchase all 167 characters, rescue 50 students in peril, find 200 gold bricks, and much more. Hogwarts school is open to you at all time where you can search the many rooms and floors for all these collectibles. You will have to wait though if you try to get everything early because many characters have their own special abilities pertaining to them.<br><br>There is no online multiplayer in LEGO Harry Potter but there is co-op. At any time another person can join you in the action, played on a single screen. Similar to LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues, when one character goes off screen, it is split automatically and the game goes on that way until they are close again.

Description=In LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues the players once again explore the Indiana Jones universe with "LEGO-fied" characters. This time the main part of the game focuses on the events of the fourth film of the series called Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with three campaigns retelling the story in a humorous, light-hearted way similar to the other games from the LEGO series. The other three campaigns on the other hand once again turn their focus on the original three films but with different scenes and levels that can't be found in the first game.<br><br>The game itself is a third-person platform/action game where the players take control over various heroes including Indiana Jones and side-characters which mostly don't have any real name. Again each character has has different abilities, fears and weapons. While Indiana Jones has his whip to pull items out of reach or constrain enemies with, his son Mutt is a very good repairman. The characters also have different phobias (snakes, rats, spiders), each corresponding to their personalities.<br><br>Instead of providing a central hub which the characters return after each mission, this time around not only the story moves forward but also the locations. So while the game starts out at the University campus and uses it as the main hub, it eventually moves over to the dig-site in South America. After each successful mission a new part of the hub is unlocked mostly through unlocking new characters or vehicles that allow the player to get to previously unreachable territory. Since these hubs are very big, a great amount of vehicles is available to unlock the same way other characters are unlocked: finding them in the hub and paying studs for them. Studs are again collected by destroying scenery objects, building stuff and such. To that end each level again holds a great amount of secret for which different characters are needed to unlock them requiring several playthroughs of the same level to find all bonus items and complete the game 100%.<br><br>The game once again features an editor to create unique heroes from parts. In addition a level editor is now available where the player walks around the map spawning the items he needs and putting them in place with his character. The two-player co-op mode also makes his return allowing two players to play through the whole game. The second player can enter the game at any given time by pressing a button on the second controller. As opposed to the previous games, the players aren't restricted to the same area anymore. Instead they now both can move freely around. Once a character leaves the screen of the other, the view gets divided with the placement of each character-view changing all the time depending on which direction the corresponding player is moving in relation to the center of the level.

In addition to running, jumping, pushing and pulling, it is also necessary to master grabbing dangling objects and swinging from them to get over some obstacles and traps.<br><br>The game can be played by up to four players simultaneously with some puzzles requiring more than one player to be solved. Levels consists of three planes: foreground, middle, and background, which can be traversed.<br><br>Next to the main game with about 50 levels, a large portion is devoted to creating user generated content. Players can design their own levels and devise custom rules. The objects used to build up the levels are largely based on the characteristics of real world materials emulated by the physics engine.<br><br>During the course of a level, stickers can be picked up for (mostly) decorative purposes or new items used to dress up the sackboys or for inclusion in the player's own levels. User created content can be shared via the PlayStation Network.

Description=The Lord of the Rings: Conquest puts the player right in the middle of the most famous battle of the Third Age including the assaults on Helm's Deep and Gondor and the battle at the Black Gate. In two campaigns the player either fights for the forces of good or the forces of evil and leads them to victory.<br><br>Similar to Star Wars: Battlefront, the player can choose from up to four classes and looks him over the shoulder while moving him over the battlefield: The warrior rushes into the crowd and fights his enemy up close and has the ability to unleash powerful combos. The mage is more focused on protecting his friends from incoming fire or healing them but has also access to a shock wave and a powerful lightning strike. The scout on the other hand turns invisible and kills even the most powerful enemy with a small stab in the back or attaches a bomb to an enemy and sends him back to his friends. The last is the Archer who prefers to stay in the back unleashing a rain of fire or poison arrows on the enemy. But each of the classes requires energy to perform the more powerful attacks which is gained by simply killing enemies.<br><br>Besides the usual weaponry a class carries like swords or daggers, the player can also find and use catapults stationed on the battlefield or get on the back of a horse to get the advantage and thin the enemy horde just by sprinting through it.<br><br>After choosing a class, the player is dropped at the first spawn point of the current map and is then required to help his allies to help fulfill different objectives depending on the game mode and map. These can range from capturing and defending positions to killing the enemy hero. While in single player the heroes on both sides are called when needed and fit the current map (like the Gandalf and the Balrog in the Mines of Moria), in multiplayer the best player of one team is automatically chosen once his team has reached a certain percentage of points needed to win.<br><br>The multiplayer mode also allows up to four players to play together through the campaigns and features three additional game modes: In "Conquest", similar to Battlefield 2142, the goal is to capture flag points on the map in a pre-determined order and once all points are held by one team, the game is over. In "Team-Deathmatch" the team with the most kills wins the game and "Find the Ring" is a "Capture the Flag"-variant featuring the one ring instead of a flag.

Description=Lost Planet 2 takes place ten years after the events depicted in Lost Planet: Extreme Condition. Thanks to Wayne's action, the planet E.D.N. III isn't just a world of ice anymore. Many parts have already dried up. Jungles with lush streams of water have grown and dry deserts full of sand popped up. But life on E.D.N. III still isn't easy. The Akrid, although bothered by the heat, are still a very serious threat. And NEVEC is working on a new evil plan while the other factions are engaged in civil war over thermal-energy. While it's no longer necessary to survive the cold, it is still needed to power all the machinery on the plant and as such very valuable.<br><br>The campaign is divided into six episodes, each putting the player into the shoes of a different faction. While at first the episodes don't seem to be connected, it soon comes apparent that it is once again up to the player to save E.D.N. III. But as opposed to the first game, he doesn't roam the levels alone anymore. Instead the campaign is fully focused on a cooperative experience, allowing up to four friends to engage in the fight for the planet. If no humans are available, the player can call up to three bots on his side.<br><br>The basic gameplay remains the same as in the first game, meaning the player take on  both the Akrids and other Humans in a third-person-shooter fashion using different kinds of weapons including machine guns, rocket launchers and different types of grenades, although only two weapons and one type of grenade can be carried at the same time. The available weaponry remains almost the same as in the first game with just a few mostly coop-centric additions like the shield. The player has also once again access to a short-ranged grappling hook which can be used to climb up buildings and walls and such in order to overcome obstacles or gain an advantage over the enemy. In addition Vital Suits, a kind of Mech, make their return in all forms of shapes including a VS in which three characters can ride and shoot at the same time.<br><br>While thermal-energy (T-ENG) isn't required to keep the body warm anymore, it is still very useful to keep the player alive. Through T-ENG, the health-bar is slowly replenished automatically or faster, when the player activates the harmonizer. T-ENG can also be used to open the chest scattered around the map, mostly containing weapons. In addition, the players can trade T-ENG to keep friends alive, even when they are low on health. If the unthinkable happens however, the player looses 500 combat points and respawns at the nearest data-station. These have to be activated through a Quick Time Event and not only dub as spawn-points but also activate the mini-map and are one source for additional combat points. When all combat points are depleted, the game ends and the player has to restart the whole section.<br><br>During the course of the campaign, the player unlocks additional customization options for his multiplayer-character like additional weapons, a different armor or gestures mostly by using credits he finds scattered around the levels. But instead of just buying the stuff, the player has to put his money into the one-armed bandit and hope it stops at the right position. <br><br>Besides the coop-mode, the game also features traditional multiplayer for up to 16 players including modes like deathmatch as well as a practice mode in which the players need to use all their skills to fulfill objectives in the fastest time possible in order to climb up the online leaderboard.

During the course of the retreat, a young man named Adam had his father killed by a Akrid named "Green Eye".

Description=A different take on EA's Madden games of realistic baseball simulation, Madden NFL Arcade focuses more on looser arcade-oriented gameplay, similar to Midway's Blitz games. It features all 32 NFL teams including top stars with a five-on-five match up, offense consists of an Offensive Lineman, a Quarterback and three receivers while defense consists of a Defensive Lineman and four backfield defenders.  Unlike other Madden games there is no time limit, instead the play ends with a set score (the default being 30) with a shortened field consisting of 60 yards with the beginning team starting on their own 20 yard line.  The offense has four tries in order to make a touchdown, however, after those four plays if the offense is not successful, it will be automatically ruled a turnover and defense will receive the ball. There are no field goals, punts or first downs.<br><br>In order to aid the player there are 13 different power-ups, including the ability to freeze a player on the field, slow or speed up gameplay, throw three footballs at once with only one going to the intended receiver, a power-up that will add an extra down, as well as a power-up that will switch the score of the game.  The player receives these at random times during the match, similar to a slot machine. When players receive a power-up they can store it and activate it at a chosen moment. There are options to play against the computer A.I. or with four friends, either two friends head-to-head or two friends teaming against a second team of friends. Online multiplayer is also supported, with the option to define custom rules along with the ability to use the power-ups available in offline play and update-able rosters to reflect current NFL rosters.

With the world's governments also faced with a global agreement – known as the “Millennium Accord” – that bans a military force from leaving its own soil, nations everywhere have turned to three powerful Private Military Companies (PMCs) to serve as their muscle. However, as the competition for earning contracts increased, a secret conflict broke out between the three organizations. And so, “The Shadow War” rages on with the forces of Raven Industries, Seryi Volk Executive Response (SVER), and Valor Company locked in a bloody and bitter struggle for domination.<br><br>The game itself allows players to select one of the three PMCs to represent throughout their career, with unique weapons, armor and skins exclusively available to each faction. As the teams win and lose various game modes over time, the results of those matches further influence the ebb and flow of the persistent behind-the-scenes “Shadow War” by rewarding contract “bonuses” to the PMC currently in control of each mode’s contracts. The bonuses play out as experience boosts that characters can then use to customize their skills, weapons and gear to become more powerful as they ascend from Level 1 all the way to Level 60.<br><br>There are five game modes in all – “Training” to teach players basic mechanics, “Suppression” which pits 64 players of the same faction against each other in simulated war games via two teams of 32, “Sabotage” that places 64 players (32 per side) in a contest for one team’s three-objective communication s center, “Acquisition” which houses 128 players (64 per side) in a struggle to steal two of their enemy’s vehicles and drive them to an extraction point, and the 256-player (128 per side) “Domination” Mode that challenges each faction to gain control of eight different command points.<br><br>MAG offers multiple facets of play with three main battlefield methods for gaining experience: shooting enemies, healing teammates, and repairing damaged structures. In addition to the three pillars, more experienced gamers can also take Leadership Roles to direct their teammates on the field and earn additional in-game bonuses. Squad Leaders can command a single eight-person squad and can set waypoints on the map, Platoon Leaders can communicate with their four squad leaders and call-in special support attacks like cluster bombs and mortar barrages, while OICs communicate with the four Platoon Leaders and can call in additional favors like sensor sweeps and rapid army deploys. Other gameplay additions like drivable vehicles, defensible gun turrets, and modular improvements via downloadable content are also included.

Description=Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.<br><br>Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball. <br>Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.<br><br>The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.

Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.<br><br>Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team. <br><br>You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes. <br><br>Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.<br><br>The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.

Description=Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.<br><br>There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Certain combinations, like the X-Men or Fantastic Four, will give you a bonus which varies by team. If you have fewer than four players. You may switch characters at any time. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.<br><br>Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also health icons to pick up. You can carry two of these at a time. Each icon can be used to instantly fully heal a character or to revive one that has been knocked out. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.<br><br>You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by playing through the game or performing specific accomplishments. Each character has a second costume to unlock. What you do to unlock it varies by character.<br><br>Throughout the game, you will have conversations with various NPCs. Some of them react differently to specific characters. At various points, you can choose an aggressive, diplomatic or defensive reaction. By answering a specific way enough times, you can unlock boosts.<br><br>The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. You fill a fusion meter by defeating enemies and are allowed to have to two fusions at a time. Any two characters have a unique fusion. These come in three basic types: There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. You target with the left stick while mashing a button to build up power. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. You mash a button to increase this radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies. You mash a button to speed them up. All fusions have a "high score." This is a target number of enemies to defeat. If you do this, you get a health token.

Description=Boyd Travers is part of the 82d Airborne Division. As a small part of a greater operation he needs to complete several missions in Italy, France, the Netherlands and Germany. He fights alongside AI colleagues in order to free Europe.<br><br>All missions begin with a jump out of an airplane after a short briefing and the chance for you to change your initial weapon loadout. The parachute-jump allows you a little freedom in the selection of your starting point. There's also always a certain area, where you get a bonus if you successfully land there. During these missions anti-aircraft weapons need to be blown up, fellow soldiers have to be rescued and enemy tanks need to be taking out using bazookas. In order to give you more choices in your loadout, you are not only given access to enemy weapons but you can the upgrades you played free. You get an upgrade when you are performing extraordinary feats of valour and marksmanship. This means for example that you earn an upgrade when you kill three enemies in a short order. These upgrades include a bigger magazine for the German K98 or a handle for the Thompson machine gun to make it more accurate.<br><br>Also notable is the health-system. Boyd has four beads of health. If an enemy hits you but doesn't empty a whole bead, your health will regenerate until the bead is full again. If you loose a bead, you need to pick up a health pack in order to regain it.<br><br>Alongside the single-player campaign there are also three multiplayer-modes called Team Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch Airborne and Objective for up to 12 players available which all feature the teams Axis against Allied. While Team Deathmatch is pretty standard, Team Deathmatch Airborne features a new twist. In this mode the Allied jump from an airdrop onto the map while the Axis begin on the ground. In objective the goal is to capture all three flags on the map.

Description=Mercenaries 2: World in Flames takes place in Venezuela and begins with the player choosing one of three mercenaries from the original game (Mattias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs and Jennifer Mui). Each merc has a special ability. Jennifer for example can run fast but Mattias regenerates his health faster but in the end they all are contracted by a Venezuelan billionaire, Ramon Solano, to rescue a general named Carlos Carmona who attempted a coup d’état and failed. Once the player succeeds, Solano and Carmona refuse to pay and try to kill the mercenary.<br><br>Afterwards, Carmona and Solano take over Venezuela, pulling of a successful coup, seizing the countries oil platforms, putting the world on alert as they seize total control of the country. Unknown to them, the players mercenary has survived and is now plotting revenge on the pair. The player must take contracts from rival factions such as Universal Petroleum, an oil company who's business is threatened by Solano, the P.L.A.V. (People’s Liberation Army of Venezuela), who are a force of rebel soldiers determined to take back their country, The Jamaican Pirates, who profit from Solano's forces, The A.N. (Allied Nations), who have entered the company to try and bring back stability to the region and The Chinese Army, who hope to take control of Venezuela as well, marking themselves as a true superpower.<br><br>The gameplay is basically the same as the previous version, with the control scheme virtually the same, but there are some tweaks as well. One of which is a new way to hijack a vehicle. Whereas in the previous game the player could simply walk up to the vehicle and automatically hijack, now they must kill the gunner of the vehicle and then enter a "mini-game", pressing a certain button or rotating the analog stick in a certain way to successfully hijack the vehicle. Likewise, players can also use a grappling hook to latch on to passing helicopters to make it easier to hijack. Players can now swim, whereas in the previous game the player would die the instant they hit the water.<br><br>Players now have a "headquarters" of sort, where the player can stockpile weapons, supply crates and vehicles. To obtain these stockpiles the player must recruit three certain soldiers unlockable in the game. A helicopter pilot named Ewan Garrett, who delivers stockpile crates found by the player in the world to the PMC as well as medivacs the player, a mechanic named Eva Navarro, who will repair and stock vehicles when you return them to the villa and is used for artillery strikes and a fighter pilot named Misha Milanich, who is used for air strikes. Players can use these by calling in Ewan to deliver their supplies via helicopter. Also Fiona Taylor reprises her role, giving the player technical information and training missions.<br><br>There is no more black market contacts to purchase supplies or airstrikes, instead players must take complete jobs for contacts scattered on the island, completing jobs for these contacts will supply the player's headquarters with materials such as weapons, medikits, and artillery support. Players can also stockpile vehicles by driving back to their headquarters, keeping them at the garage for use in missions. Also, players must have gas as well now to bring in supplies or call in airstrikes, which can be obtained by either completing contracts or collecting them scattered throughout the country.<br><br>Once again, bounties come into play, but instead of the "Deck of 52" from the first game, they are now "High Value Targets", military leaders that have defected from the Venezuela military and declared themselves independent from Solano as well as competing factions. They are scattered throughout the map, capturing them alive will give the player more money, while killing them will only reward the player half the bounty. There are also "treasures" lying around the island, such as fuel cans, weapons schematics and even pirate treasure chests as well, each has their own monetary value for collecting them.<br><br>There are also new vehicles in the game, as well classic vehicles, such as modernized tanks, more powerful helicopters and even for the first time boats and other watercraft such as jet skis as well as civilian muscle cars, high-end racing cars, as well as specialized vehicles for each faction.<br><br>There is also a Playstation 2-release of the game available. It was developed by Artificial Mind and Motion and uses the graphics engine from Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. And although the background story and basic gameplay remain the same, the PS2-version mainly features around 40 exclusive side-missions, has no co-op play and takes place on a much smaller map.

Foxhound is now led by a talented, ambitious young man with the codename Liquid Snake.

Description=Metal Gear Solid 4 is the fourth major game in the Metal Gear Solid series developed by Hideo Kojima. It ties up all of the loose plot points of the previous games while bringing back a number of characters from the earlier games in the series such as Colonel Campbell, Naomi Hunter, Otacon, Meryl Silverburgh, Mei Ling and many more. The game's main antagonist is Liquid Ocelot. Most of the story and the relationship is explained through cut-scenes with a considerable length. Due to the series extensive history, knowledge of the prior games is recommended to fully understand the story.<br><br>As the story begins Solid Snake, now looking like an old man due to accelerated aging, is being deployed in the Middle East on a mission to stop Liquid Ocelot. The game is set in 2014, five years after the Big Shell Incident of Metal Gear Solid 2. Liquid aims to take control of Sons of the Patriots, the nanomachine system used to enhance the capabilities of the mercenaries of different factions. By this he plans to assemble an army. The game is divided into five acts followed by an epilogue and a briefing. The various missions bring Old Snake to more than one location, including the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe and few more that can surprise the players familiar with the franchise.<br><br>In this game all of the actions of the previous game have been included along with some new ones such as the ability to roll on your back and fire and the ability to hide in bins scattered around the environment. Similar to Subsistence re-release of MGS3, player has full control of the camera rotation on one analogue stick while walking with the other. Shooting is now enhanced to support new shoulder camera not seen in the franchise before, much similar to that of Resident Evil 4 which will help you to easily counter-attack the enemy without having to fire randomly or switching to 1st-person perspective. The Close Quarters Combat system has been redesigned and players are now able to interrogate guards for information or supplies. The earlier camouflage system has been replaced with Octocamo that allows Snake to blend into the environment. The stamina meter from Snake Eater has been replaced by a stress meter. Based on the fighting and the climate conditions it can offer additional accuracy and reduces sustained damage. The other meter, Psyche, reduces accuracy and can be replenished by reading an adult magazine, eating or drinking.<br><br>Snake has access to the largest arsenal of weapons ever made available in a Metal Gear game, with a large array of pistols, rifles and explosives, along with the ability to mod the weapons adding scopes, suppressors, lights and other equipment to create custom weapons.<br><br>Other gadgets in the game including the Solid Eye, which is an electronic eye patch that can be used as binoculars, night vision goggles or just a device for displaying information about enemies and items scattered around the levels. There is also the Metal Gear Mk. II, which is a small robot that can be used to scout levels and electrocute enemies knocking them out for a period of time.<br><br>The game also features an complex multiplayer mode, simply entitled Metal Gear Online. Aside from the usual suspects of multiplayer shooter modes, such as "deathmatch" and "capture the flag", there are some original modes that are based on the stealth aspects of the single player games. "Sneaking Mission" mostly plays out like a standard team deathmatch, with the exception that one player is assigned to control Snake, who is equipped with his radar and Octocamo. Snake's goal is to tranquilise his enemies in order acquire their dog tags, without getting spotted. If there are enough players in the game, one player will also control Metal Gear Mk.II to assist Snake. "Team Sneaking" is basically "Capture the flag", in which the attacking team is equipped with stealth camouflage and non-lethal weapons. The defending team can only see the attacking team's shadows and weapons.

Description=An ancient samurai warlord returns and raises a new demonic army to subdue the world. But instead of hiring unreliable minions he transforms innocent animals into fearsome warriors. A ninja master notices how every transformation destabilizes the balance of nature, causing storms and earthquakes, and decides to send out his best ninja disciples to restore the order. When none of them returns, he is left with his last choice: the young ninja Hiro and his blunt friend Futo. Players control the characters through different worlds using a third-person perspective with a relative amount of freedom to explore the environment. When lost, the characters can meditate to receive a hint and see an arrow that points into the general direction of the next objective.<br><br>During the course of the game they will follow the steps of the other warriors and eventually free four of them to make them playable. The player can switch between any character at any given moment. Each ninja has different abilities. Hiro is an allrounder and the only ninja who can use Kuji spells. Unlocked by finding and praying at hidden shrines, spells include fireballs, whirlwinds and the ability to enter a spirit form where animals can be taken over to have them fight. They also make it easier to spot items and collectibles in the environment. Animals are locked up in cages but also appear when an enemy is defeated and they return to their original form. Futo wields a large hammer and is especially useful to engage larger enemies. The other characters that become available during the course of the game are Suzume, a young girl with a flute that enchants enemies when she plays music, Shun, a master with the bow, Tora who thinks he's a tiger and has big metal claws to proof it, and the acrobat Kunoichi with a long spear.<br><br>Characters have basic attacks along with a defence breaker to stun enemies and the ability to block. Acrobatic moves include wall jumping, running along walls and hanging from ledges. All characters have a sneak mode where they can hide in the grass or the environment to cause more damage when attacking or to simply avoid confrontations. Health is restored by gathering fruit and there are collectible items in the environments. When new recipes are bought, these items can be mixed into potions, bombs and power-ups. Characters level up to get better abilities and they all have a different focus attack to cause more damage.

Description=Mirror's Edge is a first-person action game set in a dystopian society ruled by a totalitarian regime that exercises a high amount of surveillance on citizens. The city has a clean look, with bright cold tone visuals that are mainly white with hints of orange. Players control Faith, a female runner who transfers information by moving over the roofs of the city as all other forms of communication are monitored. She grew up alone in the streets when her mother died during the November Riots and her father deserted her shortly after. She was taught as a little girl by a man called Mercury, who caught her breaking in and was impressed with her skills. Hunted down by a government agents, she needs to find a way to free her sister.<br><br>Based on the principles of parkour, the focus is on the freedom of movement. Although the game path is largely linear, the controls are largely context-sensitive and she needs to string up moves to build up a fluid flow of movement, by running up walls, sliding below fences, or by jumping, vaulting or climbing, using pipes, ramps or using objects as zip-lines. The emphasis on movement is enhanced through the camera, which spins, or bobs up and down according to the speed, and the prominent visibility of her arms, legs and torso. The game is also largely HUDless. When Faith is hurt, the city's colours desaturate. To assist the player in this fast-paced movement, the game applies Runner Vision where environmental pieces are highlighted when they occur to Faith as possible escape routes. In complex situations, Reaction Time, a form of bullet time, can be applied to slow down the pace without losing momentum.<br><br>Even though Faith generally needs to run from agents who chase her on foot or from helicopters, she can attack them using melee combat, or disarm agents to grab and wield their weapons. The game takes place both outside, and inside buildings and there are ten chapters in total. The story is furthered through animated films between the missions, not using the game engine. Next to the main story mode, there is a time attack mode with portions of levels and the fastest times are shown as red runners who act as ghosts. While playing, hidden messenger bags can be collected to unlock extras.

The matches are shown in a 3D presentation and the player can give commands to his athletes.<br><br>Before starting his career the player can choose his former profession which influences his stats, e.g. a former scout has a good eye for talents. With successes the player gains experience points which improve his stats. Besides the usual 30-year career there are three fantasy playing modes: In "Rotisserie" the championship is not solely based on the athletic success of the team but in the personal ranking of the player in certain categories, in "Head-to-Head" the player changes his team multiple times during a season and in the third finances play absolutely no role.

Players battle through such locales as Gotham City, Metropolis, the Shaolin Temples, or Earthrealm's Hell.<br><br>As with any Mortal Kombat game, Fatalities are still present for the Kombatants and villains, though slightly toned down to meet the DC standards of heroes such as Superman and Batman keeping to their moral code and not killing their opponent.  As a result, the DC heroes perform "Heroic Brutalities", which effectively put their opponent out of commission.<br><br>Online play is also available for players to take their fights online for ranked matches, play against a friend, or another online opponent in tournaments.

Description=MotorStorm: Pacific Rift is the sequel to the PlayStation 3 exclusive and launch title racing game MotorStorm.<br><br>Set on and around a volcanic, tropical island in the South Pacific, players continue the style of the first game, riding a varied mix of vehicles from Bikes and ATVs through Rally Cars and Trucks up to Big Rigs and, in a new addition to the series, Monster Trucks. These are able to drive over other cars, destroy vegetation and damage structures. Some abilities have been enhanced, for instance bikers can no duck or hop over obstacles. Like its predecessor, the tracks are unconventional and contain multiple routes, not all of them suitable.<br><br>The tracks will wear down through consecutive laps and this affects the vehicles' behaviour. Smaller vehicles also suffer resistance from vegetation, while the bigger rigs can plough straight through. Areas with water cause the engine to cool down, affecting the behaviour as well. The game can be played split-screen with up to four players.

Description=Naughty Bear is a third-person action game with a theme similar to Happy Tree Friends or Conker's Bad Fur Day, where cute, plushy animals act more violently than they usually do - mixing dark humour with over-the-top violence. Players control the eponymous bear to gain as many points as possible by doing naughty things, generally a euphemism for killing other animals and destroying their possessions. The game is set on Perfection Island where teddy bears live happily. Naughty is somewhat of an outsider because of his demeanour and he is the only one not invited to the birthday party of Daddles. He tries to go anyway, crafting a present for the occasion, but his gift is ridiculed by two other bears, Chubby and Giggles, and he sulkily goes back home, plotting for revenge.<br><br>The game takes place over the course of seven episodes, further divided into separate missions. Every mission has several quests to be completed, such as killing a specific bear, beating the time limit, collecting gifts, or staying undetected (Naughty Bear can hold a branch with leafs in front of his face to hide). Completing these assignments and killing other bears is rewarded with points, which opens up bridges or gates to go to new areas. That way in-game trophies (bronze, silver, gold) can be gathered, based on the amount of points, to open up new levels and unlock additional costumes, improved abilities, and badges. If the naughtiness goes on uninterruptedly, a multiplier is built up. Each chapter is a separate story slice, showing how Naughty Bear is spied on by birds, or is not invited to a cookery lesson.<br><br>Naughty Bear attacks with knives, golf clubs, legs of meat, machetes and guns - infiltrating cabins, running through the woods, and hacking away at everything he encounters. These weapons can be picked up in the levels and there is also the option to set traps and use contextual weapons involving car doors for instance, or sabotaging phone lines and escape vehicles. That way it is also possible to use a more tactical approach: sneaking around, remaining undetected and luring the other bears in your direction by sabotaging their everyday items. Chasing them is sometimes more difficult as they can warn the others or barricade themselves in their houses. Every weapon has a finishing move that can be used when another bear is hurt, shown as a short animation. There are regular bears, but later levels introduce more difficult ninja, zombie, cop, and alien bears. One button is used to hit and tapping it repeatedly forms a combo. Naughty Bear can also dodge, and use a scare attack. By torturing and haunting others repeatedly, bears can even go suicidal and start beating themselves. Most items can be smashed or destroyed by throwing them into a toilet for instance.<br><br>Multiplayer is supported with four different modes. Along with basic deathmatch (Assault), there is Cakewalk (hold on to a golden cake as long as possible), Golden Oozy (get control of a powerful gun), and Jelly Wars (collect jellies faster than the opponents).

Description=NBA Live 09 is a simulation of the basketball sport. As usual the player controls the athletes himself and tries to perform typical basketball maneuvers with his gamepad. He can choose between playing a whole season, play-offs or the FIBA World Championship. In the Dynasty Mode the player takes the role of the executive of a basketball team which means he has to grapple with managerial tasks like transfers or training. The Live Academy Mode offers special challenges, e.g. scoring a certain amount of points in a limited time. The last special mode is Be-a-Pro were the player only takes control over one athlete.<br><br>The most important innovation of NBA Live 09 is the so-called "Dynamic DNA" which synchronizes the in-game statistics over the internet with the current data from the real league. Based on these statistics the game calculates the most promising tactical moves and chooses them automatically (if he wishes the player can disable this automatism and choose it manually). The player has also the option to replay a match exactly the way it happened in real live. Also new is the Pick & Roll controls for the offensive: if the player holds the assigned button the athlete with the ball blocks it while the player controls another player and walks into position.

Description=The 2006 game in the Need for Speed series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.<br><br>Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.<br><br>The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.<br><br>The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.

Description=The player's goal in Need for Speed: SHIFT is to take part in the Need for Speed World Tour and become the ultimate champion. As opposed to its predecessors, this doesn't mean racing around an open-world city with pimped cars. Instead the game is more similar to GRID with races taking place on closed city circuits or even famous race tracks like the Circuit de Spa-Franchorchamps.<br><br>At the beginning of the game, the player drives a test-round as well as a race. During this tutorial the game evaluates the player's skill and changes the realism settings accordingly ranging from the usual arcade-style controls with many driving aids to an almost realistic simulation-like driving model. Then the main game begins where the player has to successfully earn stars in order to unlock the next tier and ultimately gain access to the World Tour. Stars are earned by getting on the podium at the end of a race as well as by fulfilling certain objectives on the track. These range from simply gaining a specific amount of points in the race to more challenging objectives like driving a clean lap. Points on the other hand are earned by the player through his driving style and are separated into two groups: Precision and Aggression. While the first group honors clean sectors or driving on the race line, aggression-points are earned by hitting other cars or sliding through curves. Once the player has earned enough points (both categories are summed-up at the end of an event, he gains a level and by doing so unlocks new upgrades for his car, get's a big money bonus or receives an invite to a special race event. To keep the player even more motivated, tons of badges are waiting to be earned which are in part also the same as the available achievements/trophies. Again actions like performing 25 overtakes or winning three consecutive races are needed to earn a minor badge. If he keeps his streak up or has earned all the minor badges in one category, he earns additional badges ranging from bronze to epic.<br><br>The available events include normal races in various variations, a time attack mode, a car attack in which the player needs to be either five seconds in front of his opponent or get 1st place in order to win and drift events. The car park includes many licensed cars from normal middle to high class vehicles to high-powered racing cars which can all be bought through the money earned by winning races or leveling up. In addition the look of the car can be changed by unlocking new vinyls. Also available are extensive upgrade and tuning options allowing the player to change every detail on his car down to the tire pressure.

A completely new mode is the Highway Battle in which the player needs to put 300 meters between him and his opponent with the main enemy being the incoming rush hour traffic. Other missions require the player to bring a specific car in the best possible condition to a garage. Since the player is undercover, the police is always watching him and makes his life more and more difficult as the wanted level of the car increases.<br><br>Successful races not only earn the player reputation to unlock new challenges and new parts of the city but also bring cash which can be invested in new cars or in the tuning of old ones. In addition one of the ten stats of the character automatically advances granting him more money for a win or increasing his ability to brake.

Description=Skira is a lovely little island in the Pacific Ocean just north of Japan and was always the center of many conflicts because of its strategic value. Sadly, nice beaches and crystal blue water isn't the only thing Skira has to offer. After the second world war, the Russians managed to gain control over the island and found a huge oil deposit of a size similar to the ones in the middle east. No one cared at first but China's economy grew and grew and with it their need for oil. Then the recession hit. China's manufacturing industry was especially affected and civil unrest got stronger and stronger bringing the country closer and closer to a civil war. Because of these riots the National People's Army guarding the Russian border under the lead of General Zhang was put on high alert, further increasing the tension between China and the international community. As Russia was preparing for the worst-case-scenario, General Zhang suddenly invaded Skira saying that the island is the rightful historical property of China. Since Russia is too busy preparing for a possible war against China on the ground, they ask the USA for assistance in regaining control over the island. Soon afterwards UH-10 Black Hawks are sighted over Skira and in one of those helicopters: the player.<br><br>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is an action-orientated military-simulation. The player moves through the mission areas in a typical first-person-shooter fashion and has to fulfill certain objectives like blowing up a generator or taking out anti-air-guns in order for the invasion to move along. But since realism plays an important part in this game, the player can't just walk up to the enemy base and shoot everyone. Instead he and his three squad-mates have to use the different stances like crouching and couching to move from cover to cover in different formations and think before a bullet is fired or in short: the player needs to take a tactical approach in order to not end up dead in the high grass. To that end, he has a radial, context-sensitive menu at his disposal with which he can give specific orders to his teammates. In addition, the player can change the weapons-load-out of each team-mate (and himself) at the beginning of each mission to what best fits the situation. The armory only covers real-world weaponry like the MK16 MOD 0 Assault Rifle. If all the sneaking didn't help and combat ensues, the player has to watch both his blood- and injury-status. Depending on where and how badly he has been wounded e.g. his arm, his ability to keep his weapon straight decreases. In addition each wound causes the player to loose blood and of course once he has lost too much blood, he'll loose consciousness and the mission is over.<br><br>The game features several multiplayer-modes. The players can either take on the whole campaign together or just one mission or engage each other in "Destruction", which is similar to Team Deathmatch, or "Infiltration" in which the smaller team has to fulfill an objective while the other has to prevent it from destroying their target. As opposed to the single-player campaign where the player has only limited access to vehicles like jeeps or helicopters, the selection in multiplayer is much greater and covers everything from a HUMVEE to a AH-1 Cobra helicopter. The PC-version also includes a powerful map-editor.

Description=Well things didn't go so well for the Overlord at the end of Overlord: Raising Hell. Although he managed to defeat the final boss and claim hell itself for his vast empire, the Jester once again crossed his plans and doomed him to forever be trapped down there. But was it really the end of the Overlord? Not really. He may be gone (for now) but he left something behind: his son, the Overlad. Smuggled to the icy lands of Nordberg, he managed to grow up in peace until his evil instincts surfaced and he was found by the Empire. Although he managed to escape, he fell into ice water and was doomed to freeze to death. But not to worry: Minion-master Gnarl finds his new master and after 50 years frozen solid it's finally time for vengeance upon the Glorious Empire and its leaders.<br><br>This time setting up shop in the Netherworld, the player takes over the control of the Overlad from a 3rd-person-perspective in order to reclaim the lands. To help him with that task he has once again access to four different types of minions: browns, reds, greens and blues. While the browns are good melee-fighters, the greens are immune to poisonous gas and the blues can swim. This comes in handy for the player to overcome the many obstacles in his way like angry elves and legion soldiers or burning road-blocks which can only be removed by the reds. Again the minions increase their strength by collecting helmets and stuff from dead enemies or broken chests. The Overlad can also increase his strength by finding new spells, armor and weapons and forging the latter in return for a minion-sacrifice in his tower. New this time around is the option to resurrect fallen but valuable minions as well as the ability of the minions to ride mounts like wolves, giving them access to new skills like jumping over obstacles and such. Also new: at specific points the Overlad can take direct control of one of his minion and by doing so access areas that were unreachable before.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer-mode for two players over LAN, WAN and thanks to split-screen even on one machine in which they can either work together to survive wave after wave of enemies or kill a very powerful Centurion or fight each other and win by collecting enough gold or killing the other Overlord enough times.

The gameplay remains exactly the same: the player controls a cannon at the top of the screen, that can turn 180º and shoot balls at a series of bricks or pegs that turn brighter when hit. The ball bounces around the screen and eventually falls down, making the touched bricks explode. The player has limited number of balls to clear all the orange pegs. A large bowl keeps moving at the bottom of the screen from one side to the other and, if the ball falls inside, it is saved and added to the remaining ones.<br><br>At the moment before the ball hits the last orange peg, the camera zooms in for a slow-motion close-up and Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" starts playing in the soundtrack.

In the Claude the lobster levels, it is a pair of claws that act like pinball flippers.<br><br>The Challenge Mode has 60 unique levels with specific goals. Five of the Challenge levels are only playable after completing 15 levels in the Adventure mode, while the remaining 55 levels are only accessible after completing it.

Within the gardens there are floating creatures called "pollen prowlers" that when touched by the Grimp or the silk thread pollen is released. Pollen is needed to fill  plant seeds that are scattered throughout parts of each garden and when they’re full with pollen a new plant instantly grows. That in turn allows to reach higher places of the garden and find things called "spectra" which is the main objective in each garden. The gameplay also features a device called "oscillator" which if goes out of tune the game ends. This is basically a time restriction the game has. The oscillator is depicted as a full bar which decreases at regular intervals.

There are two rounds, each with a question phase and a board phase. Players are asked four multiple-choice questions in the question phase. Ringing in first and giving the correct answer nets you 3 spins. The other two players then get a chance to pick their answer to earn 1 spin. Incorrect answers gain no spins.<br><br>In the board phase, players use their accumulated spins to rack up cash. The board "spins" at random until the player hits a button to stop the cycle, earning whatever cash on the space the board stopped on. If the board stops on a cartoon "Whammy," that contestant's score is set to zero. Four Whammies removes that contestant from the game. The idea is to "press your luck" as long as you can, and then dump remaining spins off on another player in hopes of forcing them into a Whammy.<br><br>As players win games, they unlock new costumes and hairstyles for their avatar.

Description=Prince of Persia once again resets the timeline of the series and marks the start of a new trilogy with the Prince on the search for Farah, his donkey, which is loaded with treasures beyond imagining. But after an sandstorm he falls down into a canyon and meets Elika, a princess with magical powers. She's being hunted by the army of her father and has to make her way to the temple beneath the tree of life.<br><br>But they come too late. After a brief fight against her father, he breaks the seal and by doing so unlocks the prison chamber that was kept closed by the powers of the Tree of Life. The inhabitant of that prison? Ahriman - God of Darkness. Creator of the darkness of space and the first to unleash envy and hate. Back in the days he was not satisfied with keeping only one half of the universe and after a fierce battle against his brother Ormazd, God of Light, he almost won. In a last attempt Ormazd successfully lured Ahriman into the Tree of Life, condemning him to a thousand years of pain. But Ahriman was only waiting. Waiting and planning and now that he is free, he and his minions are beginning to claim back what they lost and the only two people on the world to stop them are the Prince and Elika.<br><br>The basic gameplay remains the same as in the previous trilogy with the Prince engaging in sword fighting, wall climbing, spike dodging, puzzle solving, and more, in his quest to save the world. But opposed to the previous trilogy, the Prince neither can rewind time nor has to fight multiple enemies at a time. Instead he and Elika only face one, strong enemy every time and if the Prince is about to die because of a miscalculated jump or anyhing similar, she uses her powers and sets the Prince back to the beginning of the jumping puzzle. That is not the only thing she does. By command of the player, she also helps in fights, allows him to jump further distances by giving him a little push in the back in mid-air and shows which way to go next. Elika is also the key to bring the Tree of Life back to full strength. But to do so, she needs so-called "Seeds of Life" that are scattered all around the levels. If the player has collected enough of these, Elika will also become stronger.<br><br>Besides the enemies being stronger, more intelligent and having more special abilities, the fights play similar to the previous iterations of the series with the Prince slashing away at enemies with his sword or his gauntlet in to produce powerful combos. The gauntlet also allows the prince to slide down from solid rocks safely to the area below. The game features Quick Time Events when an enemy got a hold on the Prince and uses a cel-shaded and heavily stylized look for the characters.

Retrieve your sword, fight your way through Jaffar's evil guards, and save your girl from certain doom.<br><br>Prince of Persia Classic is an enhanced remake of the original Prince of Persia created by Jordan Mechner.

Description=It was just going to be a social visit. The Prince of Persia just wanted to say "hi" to his older brother, Prince Malik who is the current ruler of the kingdom. Upon his arrival however he learns that he's not the only visitor: the whole Osman's army is at the castle's doorsteps and Malik's army can't hold the fort much longer. The Prince manages to find his way into the castle and meet up with Malik in the treasury. But it's already too late. The Osmans have broken through and the end seems near. In his desperation Malik turns to the sealed portal in the treasury and speaks the magic words. Bad idea. The portal was sealed for a reason, keeping a force imprisoned that is no match for any army in the world. Rumoured to have been the knights of King Salomon himself they walk upon the earth once more, storm the castle and attack friends and foes alike. Upon his escape, the Prince wanders into the realm of Razia, Queen of the Djinn. She remembers the creation of the Sand Army and knows how to keep it at bay. So the Prince joins forces with her and tries to find a way to defeat the army and keep the Kingdom from being swallowed by the sand.<br><br>With Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands the series returns in graphical style - being more down to earth again -, story and gameplay to the one known from the Sands of Time-Trilogy after its brief departure with the  cel-shaded-adventure Prince of Persia. As such the story takes place between the events in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Prince of Persia: Warrior Within filling in some of the blanks while the player looks the Prince over the shoulder and maneuvers him through the levels. Gameplay-wise this means that the player again fights multiple enemies at once and also again jumps, climbs and rolls around in big and vast rooms to get to the other side. To be able to do so, the Prince still knows how to walk on walls, swing on rails or rip through flags to safely get back to ground level. If something goes wrong, the player can only use the Power of Time to rewind a bit and try it again as long as he has enough sand left which in turn is dropped by killed enemies and by destroying scenery objects meaning mostly vases.<br><br>To deal with the hordes and hordes of different enemies - most of them undead -, the player has access to several different kinds of more or less dangerous attacks which he can string together into powerful combos. This includes kicking and jumping around as well as a death attack which instantly kills enemies fallen to the ground. In addition, the player will gain access to special powers. As he collects the essence from fallen enemies he earns experience points for doing so, levels up and gets upgrade points which in turn are invested into a skill tree to unlock new or upgrade existing powers. Besides the power to rewind time, the Prince is able to freeze water, rebuild destroyed parts of the city or engulf himself in an armor of stone. Each of these powers is active until the energy-bar of the Prince drops to zero. Again killing enemies is they key to replenish it.

Description=The story of Prison Break: The Conspiracy is based on the first season of the TV series Prison Break.<br><br>The original story of the series is dedicated to the young engineer Michael Scofield and his elaborate plan to rescue his brother Lincoln Burrows, who was falsely accused of murder and is now awaiting execution in the Fox River prison.<br><br>In the game, however, the player does not control Michael, but a character who was not present in the TV series: Tom Paxton, an agent for "The Company", the main villainous organization of Prison Break. His mission is to get into Fox River prison and report to the company about Michael's attempts to escape with his brother. The original story serves therefore as a background for Paxton's experiences in the prison.<br><br>Prison Break: The Conspiracy is essentially a stealth game with hand-to-hand combat portions. Most of the game is composed of objectives given to Paxton by other inmates. These objectives, for the most part, involve sneaking past security guards, janitors, or hostile inmates, staying unnoticed at all times. If the protagonist is spotted, the player returns to the previous check-point and has to play the part of the sequence again. If the hostile character is an inmate, it is possible to fight him.<br><br>There are also other activities the protagonist can engage in when not being on a mission, such as lifting weights, getting tattoos, and fighting other inmates for money and other prizes.

Gameplay is updated and feels more natural in a way that goalkeepers won't be able to easily catch every ball, players will stumble on each other, slip and try to keep balance, be able to simulate fouls and hope they don't get caught by the referee, and so on. Although this time English League has imaginary emblems for unlicensed clubs such as Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and the other, many other clubs still remain with proper insignias.<br><br>Gameplay is somewhat easier and players won't kick ball so high when you hold the kicking button for too long, and dribbling is corrected and enhanced in comparison to the last game. Modes are as you can imagine them, pretty much the same... you have League (English, Italian, Spanish and the other - no German league, though), Master League, Exhibition, Training, Edit Mode and plethora of other options.<br><br>You get 59 music tracks which you can assign to play on specific part of the game (main menu, league menu, stats screen and so on).

The game features many new moves and the players move more slowly and realistic. Even a mediocre player can now have a lucky strike and hit the net from 40 meters away. Most graphical improvements go into the detail of players' faces and shadows. Although there are still five levels of gameplay, this time the computer AI acts differently from before and opens up new ways to play the game.<br><br>There are game modes present from earlier titles in the franchise, such as Exhibition or Master League, but also some new ones like UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. Become a Legend mode introduced in PES 2009 is also available. Aside from graphics, details were put into tactics and strategy where players can be positioned with more accuracy, according to his talent. An entirely new feature is the card system, tied to certain players' unique abilities. This gives that player an advantage over its opponent. In previous titles certain top players could perform stunning moves without the player's control. With the card system in PES 2010 directly control over this becomes available.<br><br>The Master League mode is more detailed and comes with sponsors, youth teams and real currencies (including Euro, British Pound, US Dollar, or Japanese Yen). Money can also be used to pay a scout who deals with negotiations, physical aspects, the trainer and other staff members. The Premier League, Liga Espanola, Italian League, Eredivisie and others are still included, as well as World Cup, Konami Cup and others, with national teams and league teams largely up-to-date.<br><br>Unlike earlier instalments, the player's individual graphical representation is gone. It is still possible to see them as a part of an entire team, but no longer for individual players. This means it takes time to get acquainted with them by going through numerical statistics or checking the compatibility of the players' maximum performance with the position they are at.<br><br>Co-op is on par with the franchise, with assisted player switching and semi-assisted and manual switching.

Description=Alex Mercer has a problem or a gift - depending on the view. Thanks to a virus in his system he has several deadly powers and can change his appearance into any person he consumes which basically means the same thing as brutally killing the person he wants to be. Of course Alex didn't voluntarily get this "enhancement". Instead he was part of a genetic experiment at a company called Genetek. Having lost his memory about what exactly happened, he is now both looking for vengeance as well as his past. The second specimen, Elizabeth Green, on the other hand meanwhile infects more and more parts of Manhattan Island with a transmutation of the virus which converts people either into mindless zombies or brutal monsters.<br><br>Prototype is an open-world game similar to Grand Theft Auto IV where the player controls Alex through a 3rd-person-view. He is able to freely roam about Manhattan Island with iconic scenery like Central Park and Times Square. But instead of stealing cars and mugging old ladies, Alex feels more like going the Spider-Man route. By sprinting against a wall, he is able to climb and jump up to the roof fast. Thanks to his supernatural jump ability and his invulnerability to falling damage, he can then traverse the city from above instead of making his way through rush hour. Of course monsters like hunters as well as the military have the means to reach him even up there. To defend himself, Alex has several powers at his disposal. He can lift heavy objects and throw them at enemies, making it easy to take down even a full-blown helicopter. He also has the already mentioned ability to shape shift into any person he manages to grab and consume. When done without being seen, it removes the heat from Alex and will, just as hiding does, eventually put his human pursuers back to sleep. The monsters on the other hand will keep at him. It also enables him to enter areas he couldn’t access before. Other powers include claws, a shield, fists like boulders that make for a good punch and powerful lash. At any time Alex can only use one of those powers and he has to unlock them first. This is done by investing the evolution points he gains for killing enemies and fulfilling objectives into upgrades.<br><br>Divided into several categories, these upgrades increase for example his sprint speed, give him new abilities like said powers or enable him to do new moves like gliding through the air instead of just falling straight down. In addition some abilities like driving a tank or improving his ability to handle normal weapons can only be learned by consuming specific persons marked with a symbol over their head. This is also necessary to replenish his health and to uncover the Web of Intrigue. The Web of Intrigue fills in the blanks on Alex’s background and what happened to him at Genetek. Some pedestrians, military personal or police had more or less direct contact with Alex or the project he was part on and if he finds and consumes them, a short cutscene shows what he learns from that person. To keep an overview of his progress, the player can access a detailed map from the menu. There he can not only rewatch every movie but can also see what information connects with others, giving the player an understanding how every piece of the puzzle is connected.<br><br>If the player isn’t doing the missions of the main storyline or destroying military bases or hives, he can find several different kinds of mini-games in the city. Ranging from kill/consume missions and waypoint races over the roof tops to fighting small skirmishes on either the side of the military or the infected. In any case the player gains additional evolution points depending how well he did. These mini-games are unlocked by progressing through the story line as well as by getting a gold medal in a mini-game. Another past-time that grants evolution points is the search for landmarks and hints hidden around the island. The more the player collects of these, the more evolution points he gets for it.

Description=Pure puts the player behind the handlebars of an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) - better known as a Quad Bike, but instead of just choosing one from a pre-existing ensemble, he has to build his Quad Bikes from scratch himself.<br><br>From the suspension over the engine to the form and color of the handle bars, he has many options to choose from. By playing through the heart of the game, the World Tour single player campaign, he unlocks additional parts by winning the events and collecting the flag hidden on the track. Some parts are purely cosmetically and don't change the stats of the bike but others have a great impact and come in a freestyle or race version. Deciding on which to use greatly influences how the Quad Bike behaves in terms of speed or how easy the player can perform tricks on it. Since the player also unlocks additional room in his garage, he can build the perfect Quad Bike for every one of the available game modes (Race, Sprint, Freestyle). This is especially important once the race has started because of the way how boost is handled.<br><br>Each trick the player makes gives him more or less boost, depending on how good it was and such factors. That boost can then be used to give your Quad Bike a temporary speed advantage. But at the same time the amount of boost the player has collected, defines which tricks can be performed. At the beginning of the race, only basic tricks are available to the driver and as he gains boost, he first unlocks advanced and then professional tricks. So the player hast to decide if he wants to be able to perform more difficult tricks, and gain more boost with one trick, or if he will sacrifice this ability for a short speed advantage.<br><br>While the game modes race and sprint are just races where the one wins, who is on the first position at the end, in freestyle the place doesn't matter. Instead the player needs to perform tricks to gain points. Once a trick has been successfully pulled off, a timer starts and when the player performs another trick before it runs out, the multiplicator goes up. There are also power-ups scattered around the map which allow the player to perform a special trick, double his points or refuel him a little. Especially the last one is important since the race goes on until the player runs out of fuel. Once everyone is out of fuel, the one with the most points wins.

It is also possible to grab other players and parts of the level to swing around using the momentum in order to quickly move to other locations within the level, surprising its opponents.<br><br>Even though this game is designed to be easy to pick up and play, the physics nature of the game allows for players to excel, mastering the Kung Fu physics moves.<br><br>By fighting and making acrobatic moves, the players gain Chi that can be used to trigger special attacks using the SIXAXIS motion sensors.

Description=A chaotic, and bouncy rally racing game.  One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain.  Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns.   Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down.  By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right.  To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright.  <br><br>Any of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode.  In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars.  Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode.  Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert.  <br><br>One trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair.  The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.

Description=Red Dead Redemption is a free-roaming western game and the spiritual successor to Red Dead Revolver. The game is set in 1911, where players take control of John Marston; an outlaw who is forced to turn on his peers when federal agents threaten his family. He is sent to the American frontier to capture his former gang members, especially the notorious leader Bill Williamson.<br><br>In the open world, the player is free to pursue to the storyline or to partake in the various events that occur while exploring the West; similar in overall design to Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series. Horses are the main means of transportation, and the player can whistle for their mount at any time. Players can also visit towns, talk to other characters, and join or intervene in events such as public hangings, ambushes and robberies. Many of these are random, including dangerous animal attacks and bandit ambushes. Other activities include hunting, gambling, duels and standoffs, with guns as the main weapon. <br><br>Based on the player's decisions, two morality systems (honor and fame) influence on how the environment and other characters react to Marston. Marston can shoot while riding a horse and capture people by lasso, combined with a cover system with specific targeting or wildfire. In the recharging Dead Eye targeting mode time is slowed down to target different enemies in specific locations, and then execute the shots in rapid succession. The player can also set up camps anywhere in the world to fast travel to known locations or save their game.<br><br>Multiplayer is supported through free-for-all, team and capture-the-flag modes, introducing crates with weapons and power-ups. Games start with a Mexican standoff where the survivor receives some extra time to gather items while the others are respawning, Similar to Grand Theft Auto IV there is a continuous free-roaming mode where players can team up in posses to form a party to engage computer-controlled gangs. Posses are made up of a maximum of eight players and all multiplayer games support a maximum of sixteen players. During multiplayer the characters can level up and gain access to new mount breeds, character models and weapon skins.

Description=Red Faction: Guerrilla is the third entry of the Red Faction series and deviates from the first-person shooter genre that the previous two incarnations featured and incorporates an open world sandbox environment similar to Mercenaries, Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row ( which the developer, Volition, has also developed).<br><br>Set 50 years after the events of the first two games, Mars has been liberated from the devious Ultor Corporation by Red Faction and the E.D.F. (Earth Defense Force) has stepped in to help the Miner Community get back on their feet.  However, the E.D.F. has become an occupying force, taking over the planet, executing citizens and imposing martial law on the planet.  As a result a new Red Faction element has been formed to fight the E.D.F. and once again bring peace and freedom to the Martian landscape.  The player takes control of Alec Mason, a recently arrived dissident of Earth hoping to make his new life on Mars with his brother Dan, only to be swept up in the Revolution and free Mars five sectors (Parker, the Badlands, Oasis, the Free Fire Zone and Eos) from E.D.F. control.  To do this the player must complete missions and destroy E.D.F. vehicles and property, lowering their control on each sector and raising the morale of the resident population.<br><br>The missions range from story missions which purpose is to further advance the story and other missions including Transporter (returning certain vehicles to a safehouse in a certain amount of time), Guerrilla Raid (where the player and a group of Rebels attack and E.D.F. building and destroying it), Heavy Metal (where the player provides a distraction which allows fellow rebels to complete another mission without alarming the E.D.F.), Demolition Master (which the player has to destroy a target within a certain time limit and a limited supply of ammo) and House Arrest (where the player must rescue hostages and return them to a safehouse).<br><br>There are also missions that pop-up from time to time including Courier (where the player must track down and kill an enemy spy to collect the information he is carrying), Assault (where the player must defend a certain target against incoming E.D.F. forces) and Convoy (where the player must either destroy a line of vehicles or capture a target vehicle and return it to a safehouse).  Completing these missions will drop enemy control of the area, raise morale of the citizens, be awarded scrap and unlock more advanced weapons.  To liberate each section the player must drop the E.D.F. control of the area to zero and complete the story missions, once the player meets this a final story mission will be unlocked which will liberate that sector and unlock story missions for the next.<br><br>Players have a variety of vehicles to choose from, ranging from cars to trucks, dune buggys and dump trucks and even tanks and APC's (Armored Personal Carriers).  There is also a plethora of weapons including pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, the sledgehammer (the players main weapon which can't be removed), remote mines, anti-personal mines, rocket launchers and the dreaded Nano Rifle (which fires a stream of nanobots that can disintegrate targets within an instant).  The player can carry four different weapons at a time and can swap them out through access at their safehouses or through ammo boxes littered throughout the landscape.  The most advanced weapons such as the Nano Rifle is only unlocked through the story missions while some can be found in E.D.F. buildings (like the Singularity Mine) and each weapon can be upgraded through safehouses which include extra ammo and more firepower through scrap.  Scrap is the game's currency which is obtained through completing missions or destroying E.D.F. buildings and vehicles.<br><br>The game also has an updated Geo-Mod 2.0 game engine which allows the player to virtually destroy a building realistically such as making it lean left by blowing up the left side of the structure or lean forward if the front is blown apart.  Players can use this to their advantage against enemies such as destroying the building from the ground floor, toppling it on enemies and vehicles or destroying the support structures of bridges with explosives, causing it to collapse with a convoy of enemies on top.  It also features the physics engine, Havok for the character physics.<br><br>There is also an offline two-player mode called Wrecking Crew where two friends take turns on four different modes such as Barrel Dash, Total Chaos, Rampage and Escalation and play a certain set of rounds to win an event.  Online multiplayer games are present as well including Anarchy, Team Anarchy, Capture the Flag, Damage Control, Siege and Demolition which awards players experience points that they can use to customize their online players and acquire more advanced weaponry.  Additionally, there are backpacks for the Wrecking Crew and Multiplayer modes which enhances the players abilities such as Jetpacks, Stealth, Vision (essentially an X-ray) and more power-based ones such as Concussion, which will knock over nearby enemy players and Tremor, which can damage enemies as well as structures.

The story takes place several years before the events of RF:G and takes place in the Mariner Valley of Mars, the home of the Marauders.<br><br>The Marauders are a group of people that are considered "savages" to the civilized inhabitants of Mars, but in fact they are descendants of the first Red Faction conflict years ago with the Ultor Corporation who has decided to live a more basic, primitive life, but still continuing the research into new technology.  For years the Marauders and have lived in secret away from the general population on Mars in peace until one day the E.D.F. (Earth Defense Force) shows up at the valley.<br><br>In an attempt to tighten their grip for control of Mars, the E.D.F. sweeps into the Mariner Valley and begins to systematically eliminate Marauder homes and families to take control of the valley and develop a new base of operations while wiping out any future threats.  In this chaos, the player's character is introduced, a Marauder by the name of Samanya whose family was slaughtered by the E.D.F. and has sworn revenge.  She then leads the Marauders against the E.D.F. in an attempt to bring back peace to their valley and hopefully drive them off the face of Mars.<br><br>The gameplay is virtually identical, with the same controls and weapons setups, the player will start out with hammer (similar to Alec Mason) which they cannot discard, but can pick up more powerful weapons such as remote mine charges, shotguns, machine guns all of which are designed in different fashions to the original versions in RF:G along with newer weapons are Marauder vehicles and walkers.<br><br>The objective is also similar, by completing both side missions and main story missions to bring down E.D.F. control of certain areas in order to advance and also destroying E.D.F. buildings and targets as well and can also unlock new weapons by completing missions.  The game, however, cannot cross into the original Red Faction: Guerrilla and has no new content for any multiplayer modes.

Description=Resistance 2 is a PS3-exclusive sci-fi first-person shooter and the sequel to the PlayStation 3 launch title Resistance: Fall of Man. The game is set in an alternate history around the year 1950 where the alien Chimera species took over Russia and converted the humans into super-powered soldiers. In the first title the protagonist Sgt. Nathan Hale, part of a US Rangers task force, managed to stop the invasion in Britain, but the rest of Europe was left invaded.<br><br>In the sequel, the Chimera have reached the United States and threaten to invade it. Once again starring Nathan Hale, he is now part of the The Sentinels task force that captured him at the end of the first Resistance. Just like the other members who fight along with him he has been infected with the Chimeran virus, but is able to keep it under control using drugs while reaping the benefits of the powers.<br><br>Many of the weapons he can wield were already present in the first game (redesigned versions of the Bullseye and Auger for instance), as a mix of 1950s human technology and alien materials, but the arsenal is expanded with weaponry such as the Marksman and the HVAP Wraith mini gun. Unlike the first game there is limit to the amount of guns and grenades he can carry, and with no visible health system it can be replenished by seeking cover, a tactic also employed by Call of Duty 4.<br><br>Multiplayer is offered in two flavours: cooperative and competitive. In the cooperative mode players can choose between three character classes (Special Ops, Soldiers and Medics) and join seven other players as the Specter Team to battle through a story that parallels the main campaign. The enemies' strength is altered based on the players' skill. While playing, new attributes can be unlocked and new armour can be acquired. Unlike the first game, co-op for the singleplayer portion is not available. Competitive gameplay supports up to 60 players simultaneously with four main modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Core Control (Capture the Flag) and Skirmish. Both humans and Chimerans are available to play and in large battles players are split up in small squads to work towards objectives.

Description=Resonance of Fate is a role-playing game from tri-Ace that takes place in the future when the Earth becomes too poisonous to live on and humanity moves to the machine-city of Basel. It is a city built high up to the sky upon a tower-like structure. The story of the game focuses on Vashyron, who is the leader of the PMF (Private Military Firm), as well as two other characters named Zephyr and Leanne, who join Vashyon's group and take on missions from the citizens of Basel. <br><br>Combat in Resonance of Fate is done through a unique turn-based system dubbed tri-Attack-Battle (t-A-B). Movement, charging, and attacks are done using the action gauge until a character's turn is over. However, enemies still attack in real time while the player is performing actions. Before attacking an enemy the player needs to build up their charge, which builds up fast if a character is closer to the enemy. Attacks in battle require at least one full charge to be successful and either deal non-permanent scratch damage with machine guns and rapid fire weapons or permanent direct damage with handguns and grenades. Dealing direct damage also makes scratch damage permanent. Once an attack is completed the character's turn is over, so it is up to the player to use their characters to deal both types of damage timely and effectively against enemies.<br><br>Special attacks in the game are presented in the form of Hero Actions where a character can be sent down a path shooting multiple times and multiple enemies while invincible to enemy attacks. Hero Actions cost Bezels and once they are depleted the player enters Critical Condition in which they cannot use items and both their attack and accuracy are greatly reduced, however Bezels can be recovered by destroying an enemy's body part or defeating it entirely. Hero Actions can also built up to another type of special attack called a Tri-Attack  where all three characters will attack at once, but it can only be perform once certain conditions are met.

Description=Iolcos is a small island in the Aegean. Protected by those who worship Zeus, it is a idyllic place with not much to worry about. At least until the wedding day of King Jason and his future Queen Alcmene for which many dignitaries from all over the world arrived - including Jason's longtime friend Hercules. But instead of celebrating the event with them, the Moriens had other plans, attacked the palace and killed Alcmene during the ceremony. Now Jason is really pissed and wants revenge. But the journey is long and at the end he has to face a dark prophecy.<br><br>The player slips into the sandals of Jason and watches over his back and controls him in a traditional Action-Adventure fashion similar to games like Rune (only without the jumping) as he roams the lands, speaks to the inhabitants and fulfills their requests while always having his main goal in mind. Of course Jason isn't just all about walk and talk. He has many enemies that want his death but three different types of weapons (swords, maces and spears) as well as his trusty shield assure that he can defend himself. Jason can switch with one button press quickly between all weapons, allowing him to do powerful combos by combining both the normal attack with the stronger, more brutal, executioner move and some of them have special abilities like knocking down all of the surrounding enemies which are activated by a two-button combination.<br><br>But Jason also has many friends. Besides Hercules other mythical heroes will join him on his journey and aid him in battle. They will also gain strength if Jason is near them and unleash powerful special abilities. If a companion dies, Jason can resurrect him and if Jason is too badly damaged, he just needs to get out of the line of fire for a few seconds to regenerate.<br><br>Jason also doesn't completely rely on his muscles but is in addition aided by the four gods: Apollo, Athene, Ares and Hermes. Each god gives Jason access to a different skill tree with many different types of buffs and abilities waiting to be unlocked. This is done two ways: One way to gain favor with the gods is by talking to people and choosing the corresponding responses for the god whose favor the player seeks. But at the same time Jason more or less automatically performs deeds like killing 35 people (Manslayer IV) during his journey which he can then attribute to a god of his choosing. Once a certain amount of favor amount has been acquired, an aspect point becomes available to distribute in the skill tree of that particular god.

Description=The Bourne Conspiracy is a 3rd person fast-paced action game, mixing shooting, a little bit of driving (one level), and hand-to-hand combat. The player controls Jason Bourne, an assassin trying to uncover his past after being injured and losing his memory in a failed mission near Marseille, and now wanted dead by his former employers.<br><br>A key component is the "Bourne Instinct" feature, which enables him to recognize threats and objectives, and perform devastating takedown moves using the environment. When you successfully shoot enemies, throw punches and kicks against your opponents, or break destructible objects with your car, an adrenaline meter fills in; as soon as one of the three segments is filled, you can issue a one-button takedown and get rid of one of your foes, or decide to wait until you accumulate multiple segments to neutralize several opponents at once. In the driving level, the Bourne Instinct is used to slow down the action for a few seconds, allowing you to avoid traffic more easily.<br><br>The combat system works in the following way: one button triggers a light attack, another button throws a heavier attack, and a third one is used to block. Mixing up the first two button presses allows to make eight different combos. Sometimes, in the middle of a fight, a sound will warn that the opponent is about to perform a takedown: the player then only has a couple of seconds to press the button corresponding to a flashing indication on the screen, and counter the move. These quicktime events are also present in a number of interactive cutscenes, where the proper buttons need to be hit within the correct timeframe or the mission will fail.<br><br>Some missions take to the action seen in The Bourne Identity movie (such as the escape from the Zurich embassy, or the Paris car chase in Marie's Mini), while others are flashbacks featuring Bourne at the time he was a cold blooded assassin working for Treadstone. In most levels, there are passports lying around, and collecting them all will unlock the bonus features: some concept art, music tracks, as well as an opportunity to replay the cinematics and boss battles directly from the main menu.

Description=Rock Band, by the original developers behind the Guitar Hero games, takes the concept a step further. Instead of solely playing the guitar along with songs, this game allows players to start a full virtual band with up to four players, with different sequences for each of the three supported peripherals: guitar (electric and bass), drum and microphone. Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics).<br><br>The game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band's score multiplier.<br><br>Players who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band's overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained.<br><br>In the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels. <br><br>Next to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content.<br><br>The European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.

Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.<br><br>The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.<br><br>The original game's Solo Tour mode and the multiplayer Band World Tour mode have been merged into a single Tour mode where up to four players can cooperate, both local and online (PS3/Xbox 360). Band leaders are no longer necessary and instruments can be swapped at will. From this mode, three options are available: Start Tour (regular tour mode), Tour Challenge (different challenges), and Battle of the Bands (compete against other bands online through score tracking - not on the PS2). The game includes a training mode for the different instruments, as well as a freestyle mode for drummers where they can drum along with custom mp3 files (Xbox 360/PS3). Other modes and modifiers for the regular game modes can be selected from an Extras menu.<br><br>The in-game characters can also be customized and 84 tracks are included on the disc, with many more as downloadable content (not on the PS2). It is also possible to transfer the songs of the first Rock Band (for a price), and downloadable content as well as the two track packs.

Description=Rock Band 3 is the third game in the main Rock Band series, and features numerous new additions to the original game.  As with previous games in the series, players form a band (of up to seven players) and perform a song together using guitar, bass, drums, vocals (solo or harmonies) and new to this game, keyboard.  By working together, players can maximise their scores.  Each player can fill a power bar by performing special sets of notes.  When they have enough of these, they can activate "Overdrive" which adds a x2 multiplier for each player that has Overdrive activated simultaneously (so, for example, having four players with Overdrive activate will score you x8 rather than x2 for only one person).<br><br>Vocal harmonies, first introduced in The Beatles: Rock Band, are carried over into the main Rock Band series for the first time.  Up to three players can perform on the microphone, with one player performing the lead, and the remaining players performing backing vocals.  By keeping in harmony with each other, players can earn double or triple score, depending on how many players can keep up.  The game also introduces a new style of play for each of the instruments, "Pro Mode".  Pro Mode is more accurate to actual instruments for those players who are looking for an even greater challenge - guitars have multiple buttons on the fret board and players must actually strum strings, the drums must have the three cymbal attachment, while with the keyboard, even more keys are used so that the performance is much closer to actual play.<br><br>The Career Mode of the game has also been revised for this game.  Rather than grinding to earn money to unlock new items, the game is instead based around Achievement-like "goals".  Each goal you unlock earns you more fans for your band, and often unlocks new items of clothing or instruments.  All songs are initially unlocked so that those who just want to play for fun can, while those looking for a deeper experience can tackle the "Road Challenge" mode, which has you travelling to different venues and performing song sets.  Each star you earn for a song gets transformed into "Spades" at the end of the performance, and the more Spades you earn, the more goals you unlock which again translates into even more fans and items.  Bonus Spades can be earned by performing the requested tasks at the start of each song, such as continuously deploying Overdrive, performing note streaks while you're in the spotlight, or deploying Overdrive when full and then performing note streaks.

Description=Rocket Knight is a 2.5D platformer and a reboot of the Rocket Knight series from the nineties, with the titles Rocket Knight Adventures and Sparkster. Players control Sparkster, a jet pack-powered opossum through levels with different themes. The game is set in Ethorn, in the kingdom Zephyrus. Fifteen years after the events of the previous game Sparkster leads a quiet farming life with his wife and kid when the mountain wolves suddenly attack with warships. Sparkster once vowed to protect the kingdom at all costs, but was disappointed when the king made an alliance with the Devotindos of the Pig Empire, who once attacked the kingdom. Regardless of the decisions the king made in the past, Sparkster immediately equips his gear and once again will defend the kingdom. It also marks the return of his rivalry with Axel, who likes to hinder Sparkster's progress and attempts to take the credit for his victories.<br><br>Aside from the graphical overhaul Rocket Knight also borrows some gameplay elements from the previous games and expands upon them. Sparkster has a number of basic movement options that allow him to jump and glide on rails. Much more important is the rocket pack that allows him to burst into the air in different directions, ricocheting off walls and attacking at the same time. Using this depletes a burst meter that takes some time to refill, except for the ice levels where it can only be restored using power-ups or by standing next to fire. These rocket bursts are needed to move around the levels and in later parts of the game it requires precise timing to quickly travel between platforms. A rocket burst can also be complemented with a burst drill by double tapping, making Sparkster break through walls. Burst assist can be used to hover temporarily in the air.<br><br>Next to the basic attacks with his sword, Sparkster can use burst to engage enemies, using burst shot to launch a bolt of energy, burst vortex to whirl on the spot with his sword and rail spin to attack when hanging on a rail. Many objects can be destroyed and some enemy projectiles can be reflected. Most of the levels follow regular platform gameplay with checkpoints and level bosses, but there are also a number of flying levels where Sparkster flies permanently into the air at a fixed speed and the game is turned into a horizontally-scrolling shooter. One of the later levels also has a vertically-scrolling section in a chasm and these later levels also put much more focus on the platform element and quick reflexes rather instead of merely attacking enemies.<br><br>During the levels Sparkster can pick up hearts to restore energy, collect diamonds and extra lives. When all lives are used up, a number of continues are available, but at the cost of having to restart the level. The main Arcade mode follows the story and afterwards these levels become available in the Free Play mode. Similar to the older titles in the series Sparkster can unlock new outfits, such as Gold Sparkster and Axel's gear. High scores and completion times for both individual stages and full Arcade modes are ranked in global leaderboards.

It stars Neil Patrick Harris and Felicia Day and includes several Rob Zombie and White Zombie songs, as well as Rob Zombie himself.<br><br>Like most on-rails games, it uses the familiar first-person perspective and guides the player throughout the environments.  There are two main ways of dealing with enemies.  The majority of the enemies use untimed measures.  There is a measure associated with each enemy.  Depending on the difficulty level, these measures can contain from one single note to a series of complex chords.  Players play the corresponding note sequence as quick as possible to defeat the enemy, though accuracy is also gauged.  Many mini-bosses and all bosses also use timed measures, which is similar to Guitar Hero where the player is playing a series of note-tracked notes along a scrolling measure.<br><br>There is a drop-in two player co-op mode.  Players can use two guitars, two drums or one of each.  This is a competitive co-op as each player has a separate score, and players can actually steal kills by completing untimed measures before the other player.  If one player is out of continues, the other player can donate unused continues to the fallen.

The game however takes place in North Korea and the UdSSR in 1986. In the role of Marcinko, the player has to retrieve intelligence on ballistic missile launchers. And although his squad-members get killed right after entering the mission area, Marcinko continues alone with the mission, eventually uncovering and eliminating a larger threat against the US.<br><br>The game is a first-person-shooter with a bit of stealth thrown into the mix. Looking through the eyes of Marcinko, the player can either sneak through the levels, using brutal kill moves or a silenced pistol to take out his enemies. Or he can run in guns blazing with the vast array of real-world-weaponry like the SPAS-12 shotgun or the AK-47 assault rifle although only two weapons can be carried at the same time. But since even Marcinko isn't invulnerable, simply storming in isn't always a good idea. To help the player from being hit, Marcinko can take cover behind objects. The camera then switches to a 3rd-person-shoulde-rview and allows the player to either blind fire or duck out of cover to shoot the targets.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer-mode for up to eight players in either Deathmatch or Team-Deathmatch on maps inspired but not directly copied from the single-player-campaign.

In order to move the story forward, the player has to fulfill missions for the resistance. But there's also a great amount of side-missions as well as many other things to do in the city including but not limited to blowing up stuff like sniper towers and Nazi tanks and killing Nazi generals. These so-called sabotage actions also net the player contraband, the currency of the game. With it he can buy weapons, upgrades and such at black-market dealers scattered around the city.<br><br>To do these sabotage acts, the player has access to several different kinds of weapons all from that time-period (including the needed dynamite) as well as his fists for melee-combat. But most of the time it is not wise for Sean to go directly into combat as he needs to escape the Nazis once an alarm has been raised in order to complete his missions. In addition the alarm level will creep up over time if he does additional damage to Nazi property and personal, alarming even heavier forces including tanks and zeppelins. To escape an alarm, he either has to leave a certain area or enter one of the many hide-spots while not being seen.<br><br>After completing a certain mission, the player will also be able to call Resistance-fighters at his side to help him in combat or bring him a getaway car. But these getaway cars need to be collected first by driving them into a black-market-garage. Once this has been done, the car be summoned at any garage. Through his actions the player also unlocks perks granting certain rewards like the 'Sucker Punch' which is gained after killing 10 enemy soldiers without them ever knowing. Sean can even slip into an enemy uniform to infiltrate the Nazis undetected but if he is seen doing a suspicious activity, the alarm will be raised after a certain amount of time. These activities include running and climbing around buildings similar to Altair in Assassin's Creed giving the player the freedom to choose his own route to his target.<br><br>At the start of the game, Paris and its surroundings are covered in black and white in a very similar style to the one seen in the movie Schindler's List with only certain colors standing out including the red in every Nazi-symbol and the yellow lights behind windows. As the player helps the Resistance liberate the sectors, color returns and Nazi activity goes down.

Description=Although Sacred 2: Fallen Angel is the successor to Sacred, the game takes place 2,000 years before Shaddar summoned the Sakkara-Demon. Set in Ancaria which is at the brink of another war, the player's goal is to prevent this war. However, it's entirely up to the player if the Light or the Chaos will prevail in the end.<br><br>All that just because of a godly energy called T-Energy. Once guarded by the Seraphim, then controlled by the High Elves, its exploitation was highly debated even among the High Elves, while more and more resistance began to form. In the end, what was feared to happen, happened: the big war started. Dragonkins, Temple Wardens, Humans, and Orcs fought side by side against the High Elves, but their power was already too great. After all of Ancaria was completely destroyed, they remained in control over the T-Energy. In the end even the remaining High Elves left their old home and built a new empire completely based on the powers of the T-Energy and inside that new home the tension between the high nobility and the clergy is escalating.<br><br>Meanwhile, the constant exploitation of T-Energy continues to contaminate whole zones and the once godly power now turns every living thing in these areas into terrible monster-mutations that destroy everything in their path.<br><br>In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between six characters of which only the Seraphim, a solid all-around character, has remained from the first game. The other five are all-new classes, such as the Dryads, masters of long-range combat and nature magic, or the Inquisitor which is somewhat an opposite to the Seraphim in all traits. Some of the class choices also effect the two campaigns and which available six gods the player may choose from. While the Seraphim can only tread on the path of Light, the Inquisitor is damned to walk the path of Chaos and has no access to the gods of light, nature, and philosophy.<br><br>While the choice of Light and Chaos effects how the campaign and its main quest ultimately play out, the gods each grant the player access to a very powerful spell. The god Testa for example, loads the hero up with T-Energy and allows the hero to shoot energy balls that heal friendly units and damage the enemies. However, as these spells are so powerful, they also have a very long cooling down period and should be used only as a last resort or against very powerful foes.<br><br>Once a character has been created, the game plays very much as the original game: the player takes on quests and kills creatures for experience points, loot to gain levels, and get more powerful. At each level the player is awarded with a skill point which the player can then invest in four different areas like defensive skills or class exclusive martial arts skills. From the 27 available skills, the player can choose up to ten and level them up. In addition, the player will find runes during travels.<br><br>These runes provide and level the talents of the characters. Once a spell or ability has been learned from a rune, learning it again will increase the level of the corresponding spell or ability until it is the same as the current character level. If the player finds runes for different characters or wants to specialize specific talents, the player can go to a rune master to trade in up to four runes and a good amount of gold for a rune of the desired talent. It's also possible to arrange the talents into powerful combos defining which spells or attacks should be used in which order. The more powerful the inserted talents are, the longer the cooling down period for the combo will be.<br><br>The game also features an extensive multiplayer mode allowing players to play on PvE or PvP servers or play the campaign in a local network (only one game copy required for two players), an open network (allows single player characters to be used) or a closed network similar to the Battle.Net.

Description=At the end of Saints Row the city of Stillwater was in the hands of the 3rd Street Saints. But the main protagonist also got blown up on Mayor Alderman's yacht, putting him in a coma. So things went down from there.<br><br>Two years have passed now and the main protagonist finally wakes up from his sleep only to find himself in prison and the city of Stillwater controlled by several rival gangs with Johnny Gat about to be put on the electric chair. With the help of Carlos, a fellow inmate, the protagonist escapes, rescues Johnny Gat and once again begins to reform the gang and move the 3rd Street Saints back up to number 1.<br><br>Before the player can enter the open and non-linear environment of the city, he needs to define who the main protagonist is by using an extensive character creator which allows for changing everything from gender to the size of the characters ears and the voice acting. But that's not the limit of customization in Saints Row 2. In shops scattered all around the city the player can buy additional clothing from underwear to hats to not only change his appearance but also the gang's. These clothes are then also available in the up to six cribs the player can unlock and buy during the course of the game. Besides changing his appearance, the player can also stash weapons and cash there, withdraw the daily earnings, rewatch cutscenes and more. He can also change the overall style of the crib and bu new stuff like a TV-set which grants him additional style points.<br><br>Style and Respect are the most important currencies besides money in the city. While respect is used to unlock missions and progress through the storyline, the player's style affects the overall respect modifier increasing the amount of respect earned. As stated style points are earned by upgrading the characters look, home or car. Respect points are instead earned through the many activities and diversions available in the city.<br><br>Activities are mini-games that are started at a one of two specific points in the game world and span out over six difficulty levels. After completing three levels, the player gains unlockables like a 5% discount on clothes. Besides activities already known from Saints Row, Saints Row 2 includes six new ones including "Crowd Control" in which the player needs to protect a VIP from intrusive fans and "FUZZ", a parody of COPS in which the player is followed by a camera crew and has to deal with criminals in a very creative manner to gain points. Diversions on the other hand include the simple driving on the wrong side of the road, doing stunts, playing poker in a casino, hijacking a car with more than one person in it and taking the passengers hostage and doing the job side-missions like driving the tow-truck or playing taxi.<br><br>The game also features several multiplayer modes ranging from a two-person coop-mode to twelve player deathmatch ("Gansta Brawl") and team-deathmatch ("Team Gangsta Brawl" and a mode called "Strong Arm" in which the team wins that manages to earn $100.000 first. This is accomplished by winning events based on single player activities like racing. Each activity has a time limit and at the end the winner goes home with $10.000.

Then the game switches to a first person where Max chooses and uses one of these powers.

Description=Based on the popular movie franchise of the same name, Saw casts the player as the former detective David Tapp, shortly after the events of the first movie. The Jigsaw Killer has healed his gunshot wound and has locked him up in an abandoned asylum to teach him a lesson about life appreciation. Tapp's primary tasks is to explore the building and find an exit, while avoiding or solving Jigsaw's traps and puzzles.<br><br>Upon starting the game Tapp is instantly faced with the task of removing a trap known as the Reverse Bear Trap, a mechanism that is set to go off and tear a human head apart. After getting the trap off his head, he is free to wander a mental institution filled with obstacles such as shotgun doors, broken glass that cuts Tapp's bare feet, and other victims of Jigsaw who are after Tapp because Jigsaw has hidden the key to their traps inside his chest. Mysteries surrounding the films need to be uncovered, there are different characters to meet and it is possible to see the sets recreated from them.<br><br>Tapp's actions affect the outcome of the game. If he is not careful, in some traps innocents will be killed, and some of those wandering the halls are not violent. Killing them affects the game's outcome, as well Tapp's ability to save others from certain traps.  The game has two endings, a positive and a negative.  The positive ending is the only ending which is canon to the films, the negative ending is not canon.  <br><br>Players control Tapp from a third-person perspective, and the game has a combat mechanism very similar to Silent Hill: Homecoming. He can use various weapons in the environments, however they will break after being used a few times. Some enemies have traps that may affect their skills; enemies with square shaped traps on their head cannot see but will attack if they can find you, while enemies with dynamite strapped to their hands will explode after death which can harm you, and so on.<br><br>Traps can be used against enemies as well; fuse boxes can be switched on above a pool of water and anyone who steps in will be electrocuted, and later in the game the player can re-set shotgun doors and hide from enemies. While progressing through the game, new kinds of traps can be found, as well as new weapons, light sources, and even the ability to create new traps or weapons from junk around the asylum. Some of the larger, more complex traps require Tapp to save both his own life as well as another person's life, and others may force him to make a decision between his own life or the others. These traps are often presented as complex puzzles. The game rewards the player for finding clues and documents strewn around the Asylum, and in many cases Tapp will not be able to escape a trap without the help of the clues.

Arcade Mode: This mode allows for wheelies and break off beyond the limits without the fear of falling off. The core is the Story Mode in which the player starts out in the Superstock 1000, By gaining reputation points he'll slowly make his way up to the World Superbike Championship. Reputation points are earned by fulfilling the objects during each race. To that end, the races often don't start at the beginning. Instead the player e.g. has to make his way to the 10th place, starting from the 14th in only two rounds. <br><br>2. Simulation Mode: Here, everything is about realism - even on the lowest setting. The core is the career mode. The player once again starts out in the Superstock 1000 and has 8 seasons to become the new Superbike World Champion. But instead of challenges and chapters, this is the real deal featuring complete races (including qualifying and warm-up), a very sensitive control scheme and tons of ways to change the settings on the motorcycle to best suit the needs of the track and the player<br><br>Both modes require the player to create an individual rider by choosing his look, his outfit as well as his riding style and feature several quick-play-options. A multiplayer mode for up to 16 riders is also available sporting quick races, time attack as well as personalized single and team championships.

It is a throwback to 8- and 16-bit era beat-'em-ups, particularly River City Ransom, and features art by popular pixel animator Paul Robertson as well as a soundtrack by New York chiptune band Anamanaguchi.<br><br>Initially choosing from either Scott, Ramona, Kim Pine, or Stephen Stills, up to four players must fight their way through the streets of Toronto, Canada in seven levels. Each stage is made up of multiple sections, culminating in a battle at the end with one of Ramona's exes. Around each stage there are many shops, some of them hidden, as well as destructible objects and weapons that can be picked up. The way characters progress and level up is similar to Castle Crashers and earlier levels can be revisited.<br><br>Each character starts with only a handful of moves -- punches, kicks, jumps, dashes, and blocks -- but as enemies are defeated, characters earn experience which unlocks new moves like running tackles and leg sweeps. Defeated enemies drop coins, which can be picked up and spent at the many shops around Toronto. Items will often replenish health, as well as increase various character stats based around strength, speed, defence, and others.<br><br>Characters also have access to several special moves, which use a "Guts" meter: an area-clearing attack that has low power, but will knock nearby enemies away; and a special striker move, which will call in another character, usually Scott's romantic stalker Knives Chau, for a quick support attack. If a player manages to take out five enemies without taking a hit, their character will glow for a short time, increasing their speed and strength drastically. In the co-op mode players can perform attacks together and lend each other money.<br><br>The game has a large number of unlockables and secret bonuses, such as a secret character and a new striker move, a Boss Rush mode, and a Zombie mode.

Except for the heavy armor, all vehicles have place for more than one player, especially making the tank a powerful weapon thanks to it's four weapon systems each of which is controlled by a single player.<br><br>The armor of Section 8 not only can withstand a drop from high altitudes, it also has an integrated jetpack, allowing for short periods of flight and a booster to temporarily run faster. These functions consume energy which is automatically replenished when not used. The drop from the sky, called Orbital Burn-In, which is the way the players spawn, can be controlled to a limited degree. While the spawn-point can be chosen from a map, the players can decide themselves when to engage the breaks of their suit. While a soft landing allows for the player to immediately go into combat and steer a little bit, it makes him vulnerable during drop-down. A hard landing on the other hand is fast but the player then needs a few seconds to recover from the impact.<br><br>While Conquest is the only gameplay-mode available, there are different types of bot-modes available. Besides playing a game without any bot, the host can choose between Balanced (filling the game to the maximum number of players allowed with bots), Coop / Extreme Coop (all players are on one team, bots on the other) and Swarm / Super Swarm (one small team against a large swarm of hostile bots). Only available in singleplayer is the One Man Army-mode which pits the player alone against an entire team of hostile bots.

For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. <br><br>Minigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.

Description=Shatter is a modern take on the video game classic Breakout. Like in the original game, the player has to bounce a ball off a bat to hit stones which break on impact. Shatter introduces a couple of new twists to the genre. The player is able to influence the ball's direction by either pushing it away from the bat or pulling it in. Some of the stones manipulate gravity and change the ball's flight path. And yet other stones explode on impact or fly away in a certain direction. There are also rotated or oddly-shaped playfields, with general Sci-Fi theme.<br><br>Certain stones hold power-ups such as a manoeuvrable ball, extra lives, a stronger ball that dives through most stones without bouncing back, and more. Broken stones also release blue fragments that can be collected. These are added to a meter and when it is full, a shard storm can be unleashed. As influencing the ball's trajectory can also attack loose stones, the bat has an optional shield to protect itself.<br><br>The game has different modes and not all of them are available right away. There is a story mode that follows the bat through 10 worlds. It progressively introduces new gameplay elements to the player. Each world has a boss to defeat, all of which can be fought later in the unlockable boss mode. Another mode consists of bonus rounds, where the player has to knock back balls to gain a high score. These are also played after defeating a boss mode in the story mode. The other game modes are endless, endless co-op, time attack and time attack co-op.

Description=Shaun White Snowboarding gives the player, as the title suggests, a snowboard and sends him off to four ski run locations around the world (Europe, Alaska, Japan and a fictitious location called Park City) under the watchful eye of professional snowboarder Shaun White himself as well as other professionals, moderators, pilots and such. But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards.<br><br>During the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts.<br><br>The game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests, everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in.<br><br>The multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN. The other players are also just dropped into the open world with the freedom to just do what they want on the server.

After the plane crash, a Special Ops unit headed by Sergeant Caleb Walker is send in to retrieve the cargo. In the end only Cal returns from this mission but he has changed. Something has driven him insane and unfortunately that thing has followed him out of the jungle. <br><br>Nate Walker, Cal's younger brother is now brought in to get information about "Whiteknight" from Cal who is kept in quarantine because he is carrying a highly contagious and horrifically destructive virus. But only moments after he meets his brother VC forces attack the outpost and in the chaos Cal breaks out and escapes. Now it's Nate's job to hunt Cal down, solve the mystery of "Whiteknight" and survive the horrific nightmare called the Vietnam War.<br><br>The player puts on the boots of Nate and moves him in a traditional first person shooter fashion through the linear levels. These are cluttered with Vietcong and other more or less alive dangers. But grenades, pistols, M16s and other firearms as well as mounted machine guns help the player to hold his enemies at bay. If an enemy overwhelms Nate or in certain scripted situations, a quick time event starts in which the player needs to press the buttons shown on the screen as fast as possible or he'll meet his maker. Has the player successfully survived the attack, he can then decide which way his opponent should die.<br><br>As its predecessor Shellshock: Nam '67, Shellshock 2: Blood Trails doesn't hold itself back in terms of violence, gore and horrific imagery.

Description=Revolution is a turn-based strategy game about development and territorial expansion, with sixteen distinct civilizations from prehistoric times to the future. Not counting Silent Service, it is the second console-only Sid Meier branded game, the first being Sid Meier's C.P.U. Bach, and it is the first in the Civilization sub series to be released on console platforms.<br><br>Specifically built up with console controls in mind, the original gameplay is intact but with stripped-down complexity. The available civilizations include America, England, Japan, Aztec, China, India, Mongolia, Rome, Egypt, France, Arabia, Greece, Spain, Germany, Zulu and Russia, each with their own leaders (e.g. Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln) and specific perks. Another civilization, the Barbarians, is not playable and they constantly wage war with the other ones. Gameplay sessions are generally shorter with fewer victory conditions and simplified city management. The possible strategies are still very open, as the four victory conditions are Domination, Technology, Economic and Cultural. Players can either build vast armies and try to dominate the other civilizations to capture their cities (Domination), or use a more subtle, diplomatic approach to gain the upper hand. There is a technology tree to eventually move into space and be the first to reach Alpha Centauri (Technology), players can try to create a World Back earn 20,000 gold (Economic), or build twenty wonders (Cultural).<br><br>Units are often specific for a certain civilization and gain experience, as well as through research, to access upgrades. That way, a catapult can eventually become a tank. The focus is as usual on micromanagement. The two single-player modes allow for straight matches against AI players or rather fixed scenarios to complete. Multiplayer is supported for up to four players, free-for-all or with teams.

Homer can expand into a rolling blob, Bart can become Bartman (with grappling hook), Lisa can use her saxophone to stun enemies, and Marge can gather mobs with her megaphone. Each character has a power meter that limits the use of the special abilities, which is recharged by defeating enemies. They also have powers that can only be used at specific trigger points, such as Bart catching updrafts with his cape, Homer inflating himself with helium, Lisa summoning the hand of Buddha to move objects, and Marge sending Maggie into crawlspaces. The abilities are upgraded throughout the game. Each character also has an item they can pick up which will make them temporarily invulnerable, and give them unlimited special attacks for this period.<br><br>The game is divided into a series of sixteen "episodes", each a parody of a popular game or genre; these episodes have names like Medal of Homer or Neverquest. Each level features two or more of the Simpson clan. Players must switch back and forth using each family members' unique powers to complete each level.

Anyone that is remotely interested in 'Singstar' knows how the title operates - it turns your console into a modern day karaoke machine: Displaying the videos and music of some classic pop songs (it comes with around 30 initially), and presenting the words with which you and a few friends (or alone if that floats your boat) can accompany on the provided microphones.<br><br>The game works very much like the original title (and its many derivatives). However, unlike the original the PS3 version now has the opportunity to download additional content for the title via the games own 'Singstore'. This additional content can range from minor extras such as game wallpaper and viewing other people's singstar extras (a singstar version of YouTube and just as embarrassing!). However the main reason for accessing the singstore is the ability to download additional songs for the title (stored in the game data folder). At the moment there aren't many songs available, but with more being added all the time the opportunity to download your favourite songs for a fraction of the price of buying a newly-updated or musical genre based version every 2 months is a welcome one. Buying the extra content takes the form of a sort of division of the PlayStation store - it accesses the account of the profile currently in use and deduct funds from the master account - it generally works out at around 99p per song and for that song that you 'must have', its good value - although why 'Land Down Under' wasn't in the main list that cam e with the game is beyond me - karaoke classic!<br><br>Another new feature of the PS3 version is the ability to upload videos to the aforementioned store for other users to view and generally make fun of your tone-deafness. Used in conjunction with the PlayStation Eye, this is achieved by the eye recording the action (and audio) while you drunkenly sing along to your favourite tunes. A great feature that makes use of the PSN capabilities.<br><br>The tracklist:<br><br>1. Blink 182 - All The Small Things<br>2. Blur - Coffee & TV<br>3. Britney Spears - Toxic<br>4.

Description=Those Russians again. Just because they felt threatened by America and their nuclear bomb, they had to look for uranium themselves after World War II ended. However, instead of uranium, they found something else on the small island off the east coast of Russia, now called Katorga-12. What did they find? E99 - the most powerful energy source known to man. Of course Stalin immediately realized the scope of this discovery and pumped as many funds as possible into researching its military potential.<br><br>In the beginning, everything was fine. However, after the death of the famous dictator, his successor wanted more. So instead of being careful and taking it slowly, he had to rush the scientists on Katorga-12. It is no wonder that in 1955 something went completely wrong, leading to the creation of the Singularity which in turn kills everyone on the island, basically shutting down the whole project. Wait, "killing everyone"? Well, not everyone as it turns out, when in 2010 an American spy-satellite picks up radiation over the island, putting the government at high alert because of the fear of another Chernobyl disaster. To find out what is going on, they sent the Black-Ops-team Spartan-21 to investigate. Sadly, their mission fails a few moments after the intro movie. As one of the sole survivors of the helicopter crash, it's now up to the player in the role of Nathaniel Renko to uncover the mystery of Katorga-12.<br><br>In its core, Singularity is a straight-forward shooter, heavily inspired by games like BioShock (overall look of the game, audio tapes and notes which tell the story of what happened on the island) and Cryostasis (flashbacks with ghosts which show scenes from the past some of which the player takes part in). The player looks through the eyes of Nathaniel while shooting his way through the fairly linear levels of the game using more or less futuristic weapons (of which he can only carry two at a time). The weaponry includes a pistol, a shotgun as well as more more original stuff like the Seeker which shoots E99-enriched bullets controlled by the player. Each weapon can be upgraded several times increasing the size of the magazine or its strength. These upgrades, as well as swapping weapons and buying additional ammunition, is done at weapon lockers scattered around the levels. In order to do an upgrade however, the player needs to find both hidden cages containing weapons technology as well as collect the E99-technology lying around.<br><br>The main creative ideas however, are focused on the Time Manipulation Device (TMD) the player finds early in the game. Wrapped around his left arm and constantly being upgraded during the course of the game, this device allows the player to manipulate space and time both in combat and for solving riddles. Using the TMD on human targets like the Russian soldiers on the island, will result in them dying from old age within seconds. The different kinds of monsters (mostly former humans hit by the Singularity) however react differently e.g. some explode after a few seconds. Later in the game, the player can even turn a human soldier into a monster which in turn fights for a certain amount of time on his side.<br><br>Thanks to the ability of the TMD to manipulate the age of an item, it is also important to solve the many riddles. This way the player can age a crate until it collapses, use the TMD like the Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2 to place the remains under a almost closed rolling gate and then return the crate to its original state which in turn pushes the gate open. In addition to the automatic upgrades granted throughout the game, adding abilities like a time-ball which freezes everything inside it in place, the player will also find formulas during his journey once again using them in addition to E99-technology at specific upgrade-stations to further increase the powers of the device. Finding the TMD also allows the player to travel back in time to 1955 when everything went downhill at certain points in the game, giving him the chance to alter the course of history in order to reach his goals. While his choices are predefined there, the game still plays heavily with the mind of the player thanks to these trips back and even offers three different endings.<br><br>The game also features multiplayer for up to 12 players in the two team-based modes "Creatures vs. Soldiers" and "Extermination". While the latter is simply Team Deathmatch, "Creature vs. Soldiers" requires the soldiers to capture beacons on the map and defend them for a certain amount of time in order for the next one to become available while the creatures do everything in their power to prevent that. In both modes, players can choose from four different classes on each team and can customize them a little bit like choosing which weapon and TMD-power the player uses as a soldier. While the soldier-classes are pretty straight forward, the four creatures are all very unique and each have their own special abilities to compensate for the soldiers having access to the powerful TMD including seeing enemies through walls or turning into a soldier for a short time.

To become a top skater, players has to enter skating challenges marked on the map to gain notability, attracting sponsors and having tricks photographed or filmed.

Description=The easiest way to describe Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing would be to call it a Super Mario Kart clone. But instead of featuring famous Nintendo-characters like Mario and Bowser, the players use Sonic, Billy Hatcher, Dr. Eggman and 17 other more or less famous characters from the SEGA games library.<br><br>The core gameplay remains the same though: in a normal race the player has to compete against seven other racers using both his racing skills and one of the several different power ups that are scattered around the track like a boxing glove to shoot racers in front out of the way or mines to destroy his pursuers. Since all cars drive at the same speed, no matter which character they belong to, charging up the boost by doing drifts is the most important thing in order to get to first place. Tricks are also available to gain access to a turbo-boost. But the decision what racer and car to use does influence which All-Star-Action is available to the player. While Sonic the Hedgehog turns into Super Sonic for a short while, giving him a great amount of additional speed, Billy Hatcher lays egg-shells on the track to obstruct his followers. Like all other power-ups, the All-Star-Action has to be collected on the track first before it can be used.<br><br>The game features several different game-modes. In single player the player can either do time trials, single races, a Grand Prix or one of the several dozen missions that are available and require the player to fulfil many different goals other than simply being the first in a race. These goals include using one long drift to get to the finish line, roll over as many crows as possible or get to the finish line without destroying any pots and many more. <br><br>Multiplayer consists of a split screen mode for up to four players and an online mode (not available in the PC-version). Besides normal races several battle modes are waiting like King of the Hill or simple Deathmatch. Completing a mission or winning a race either in single player or in multiplayer earns the player SEGA miles which are used in the internal shop to unlock additional characters and tracks.<br><br>The Xbox 360-release features in addition to the SEGA characters and tracks also Rare’s Banjo-Kazooie - hence the additional subtitle.

Sonic meets Elise, the princess of Soleanna, which he quickly makes friends with. Unfortunately, Dr. Eggman quickly intervenes and kidnaps Elise in order to destroy the kingdom of Soleanna and its up to Sonic to rescue her. <br><br>A line-up of characters from previous games make their returns including Tails, Knuckles, Shadow and a brand new character, Silver the Hedgehog. Sonic races through stages with blinding speed using the 3D elements similar to the Sonic Adventure games. Along with new gameplay elements, familiar features make a return. The gameplay is split up in action stages, fast levels with alternate pathways, and free-roaming town stages where the characters can explore the towns, talk to other characters, get new quests, and visit the shops, similar to the Adventure Fields from Sonic Adventure.<br><br>During the game, three main characters can be controlled: Sonic, Shadow and Silver. There are 11 stages in total, and they are tweaked to the abilities for each of the characters. Sonic is the only one to have access to super speed stages, and he has custom abilities, such as the spin dash, light dash, homing attack, bounce attack, a sliding kick, a tornado kick, a mach speed dash and grinding. These are acquired in exchange for rings in stores. Sonic can also trade gems for special powers. Shadow's abilities are largely derived from Shadow the Hedgehog, with a focus on driving vehicles such as buggies, hovers, bikes and gliders. There are also various melee attacks, similar to those of Sonic, but Shadow does not use firearms in this game. The new character, Silver, is a time-traveling hedgehog. His main means of attack are psychokinetic powers. He can pick up and throw objects, and levitate. Additional abilities can be purchased in the in-game stores in exchange for rings.<br><br>For certain missions, you take control of an amigo, automatically assigned in specific stages. Sonic gets the help from Tails and Knuckles the Echidna, Shadow's sidekicks are Rouge the Bat and E-123 Omega, and Silver is assisted by Blaze the Cat and Amy Rose.<br><br>There are two multiplayer modes: Tag Mode (co-op) and Battle Mode (versus in a race for gold medals). The characters are voiced by the cast of the Sonic X animated TV series.

Description=Sonic The Hedgehog 4, as the title indicates, is a direct sequel to the classical series of Sonic platformers on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis. The story continues after the events of Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, where Sonic and his friends spoiled the plans of Sonic's nemesis, Dr. Eggman (a.k.a. Dr. Robotnik), once again by destroying his Death Egg and returning the stolen Master Emerald. The victory, however, is short-lived, as Eggman is up to revenge and rebuilds and improves his greatest creations for the sole purpose of destroying Sonic once and for all.<br><br>The game does not only return to the original series in terms of story and title, but also in terms of gameplay. Sonic 4 is a classical 2D sidescroller like its predecessors and also features the same game mechanics as the old games. There are some new additions, for example the &quot;Homing Attack&quot; which locks on Sonic's jump on enemies, jumping pads or breakable items. One major difference are the graphics, as Sonic 4 uses polygons for the Sonic characters and prerendered graphics for everything else, so does not recreate the looks of its predecessors, unlike, for example, Mega Man 9.

Description=During a fight on one of Dr. Eggman's spaceships, Sonic becomes caught in a nefarious trap!  Eggman uses a device to extract the Chaos Emeralds' power, and inverts it, sending a blast to the planet below which shatters Earth into pieces, reawakening a being called Dark Gaia.  With Sonic no longer of use to him, Dr. Eggman quickly jettisons him and the now dead Chaos Emeralds into space, where he crash-lands on the Earth below.<br><br>Sonic Unleashed is a combination of two types of games: during daytime stages, Sonic is his normal self, with intense speed-based levels that are reminiscent of his original games.  When night falls, Sonic transforms into a monstrous, yet powerful 'Werehog' with stretchy arms.  In nighttime stages, he must brawl his way through 3D environments crawling with Dark Gaia's minions.<br><br>As players defeat enemies in both types of stages, they earn experience which allows them to level both Sonic's normal and Werehog abilities, such as speed, strength, life, combat and so on.  There are also 3D hub worlds to be explored during both day and night, with different events occurring in each.  Sonic can help the townsfolk with tasks for items and rewards, or purchase items from shops using the rings he's collected throughout the stages.<br><br>Sonic's buddy Tails also makes an appearance during stages where they fly his plane.  During these stages, you must press the appropriate button sequences as they appear to shoot down any oncoming enemies.

Description=Continuing the eternally retold tale of souls and swords, Soulcalibur IV is once again the story of the swords Soul Edge and Soul Calibur and those who want to have or destroy them. The swords are on the fast-track to resurrect an ancient king, and only the player can stop him from unleashing his ambiguous evil upon the world.<br><br>Soulcalibur IV continues the series' 3D blade fighting game play, with a few enhancements. The ability to break your opponent's defences from the first game finally returns in the form of destructible armour. Corresponding to the game's high, middle and low attacks, armour will weaken in these areas the more the player guards against attacks until the armour finally shatters. Also new is a Soul Gauge, which measures green-to-red how much a player has defended. Pushing the gauge beyond red causes a Soul Crush, which will create the opportunity for the opponent to do a character-unique one-shot kill called a Critical Finish.<br><br>Most of the regular cast returns for this bout with the addition of several new characters, the most publicized of which are Yoda on the Xbox 360, Darth Vader on the PlayStation 3, and Darth Vader's Apprentice on both consoles. All three characters have force powers that make use of an additional force meter that limits how often the powers can be used. Use beyond the meter will instead start draining the life of the character. Also new is Hilde, an armour-clad woman defending her homeland against the forces of the Soul Edge with a long pole-arm and shortsword. The final boss Algol is also a playable character, wielding the Soul Edge as one hand and the Soul Calibur as the other, as well as wreaking havoc with his teleporting chair. In addition, five "bonus" characters, each specially designed by a Japanese artist are included that recycle the move lists from the a-list characters.<br><br>The regular Story, Arcade, Training and Versus modes are still present, but Soulcalibur III's Chronicles of the Sword is supplanted with a new endurance-style campaign called Tower of Lost Souls. Players Ascend, and then Descend the tower by fighting waves of enemies, unlocking new items along the way by achieving certain conditions such as no ring outs or taking no damage. The versus mode is available in both regular and special varieties, the former enforcing only baseline characters while the latter allowing the use of customized skill sets and equipment. New to the series are online modes allowing you to play on the Internet with other players. Both ranked and unranked matches are available in the same regular and special modes as versus.<br><br>New characters and items are unlocked by spending Gold that is earned in the online or single-player modes, with some characters only unlocked by defeating them in the single-player modes. Gold can also be spent in the museum to unlock artwork.<br><br>Also returning from Soulcalibur III is the create-a-character feature that allows you to create your own custom fighter that can be used in all of the game modes. The selection of parts for characters is greatly expanded upon from Soulcalibur III, and it is also now possible to customize the equipment of the stock characters with the exception of the force users, the final boss Algol and the five "bonus" characters. Unlike the previous game equipment is now more than aesthetic, granting boosts or penalties to HP, defence, attack and various skill points. The skill points can be used to equip new skills that provide abilities such as Auto-Counter, Anti-Ring Out, and boosting stats when the Soul Gauge is low.

Spider-Man then meets Luke Cage who helps train him to defeat the city gangs. During an attempt to save some gang leaders from assassins, Spider-Man is attacked by residents who are controlled by symbiote. The symbiote substance terrorizes the city as it spreads and attaches to innocent citizens. Spider-Man begins a quest to save New York City.<br><br>He sees the epidemic sweeping the streets below as he’s able to swing over and between buildings with great speed and agility hunting down baddies.

The player has the ability to change suits easily where you can defeat bad guys as either the red Spidey using his web or the black Spidey using the tendrils from the symbiote. Other destructive combo attacks are the same regardless of suit color. Choosing one suit color over the other is more of a player’s personal choice for each fight and doesn’t have an impact on the game’s outcome. However, the player will be forced to make decisions during the game that are equal to Spider-Man’s red suit or black suit morals. The choices made at these times will lead the player to different endings based on the paths taken. Points are earned as he fights crime and advances to help upgrade moves and actions.<br><br>The game’s well organized plot leads the player through exciting missions and crime fighting action that can be played again for a different ending by making different choices the second time around.

Description=The Splatterhouse franchise rises from the dead in this new high-definition revamp!  The new Splatterhouse is not a sequel, but rather a re-telling of the original story following poor battered hero Rick as he dons the Terror Mask and works his way through hordes of demons, monsters, and other beasties to save his girlfriend, Jennifer, from the mysterious and evil Dr. Henry West.  <br><br>Like the previous classic entries in the series, Splatterhouse is a beat-em-up style action game in a horror setting.  And like previous entries in the series, Rick is transformed into a hulking beast of a man when he puts on the Terror Mask.  In the classic games, Rick's primary attack was to punch enemies with some kicking involved, and occasionally picking up crude weapons, such as a 2x4 piece of wood.  Like the previous entries, players work their way through horror-themed environments inside a creepy mansion with boss battles at the end of each stage.<br><br>All of these features remain in the HD revamp, but there are several levels of depth added.  Two buttons are used for punching, another for grappling, and there are "modifier" buttons which add sprint options and mix up the "standard" attacks.  Over two dozen combos and special attacks are available for players to unlock and master adding new levels of variety and depth to the beat-em-up formula.  Rick can still pick up various weapons and items, and even turns parts of his body into a weapon once the abilities are unlocked.  Rick also has several finishing moves at his disposal, which can be activated when beaten enemy characters feature a red halo around their body.<br><br>Through the gameplay, players spill and collect gallons of blood and splatter from enemy characters, and this blood works as currency to purchase upgrades to weapons, attack combos, more health, and the like. <br><br>Rick will show several levels of damage to his body as he is attacked and hurt featuring anything from exposed ribs to a missing arm.  While limbs regenerate over time, health must be siphoned from enemies.  With health recharging occurring largely whenever the player wants it, Rick takes damage fairly easily forcing players to carefully monitor and maintain their health during the mayhem of the gameplay.  <br><br>Splatterhouse features collectibles such as pieces of sexy pictures of Jennifer and logbook notes in the form of gramophones strewn throughout the stages.  These can be viewed in the Collectibles section of the main menu.  <br><br>Besides the regular Story mode, there is a Survival mode which expands with more stages as players progress through the Story mode.  Survival mode simply puts players in a stage with the challenge being, perhaps obviously, survival.  Like Story mode, there are pictures that can be collected through the Survival mode.<br><br>Splatterhouse also features another bonus--which is the original trilogy, once they have been unlocked through regular gameplay.<br><br>Splatterhouse is a one-player game and also allows for custom soundtracks.  Beyond original music, the standard game features over a dozen Heavy Metal songs which are typically played during action-heavy sequences.  Some bands featured include Cavalera Conspiracy, High on Fire, The Accused, and Five Finger Death Punch.

Description=Split/Second is a TV-Show all about cars, destruction and explosions and they are always looking for new participants. For the twelve episodes of the new season, they hire the player to be one of the eighth drivers and perhaps even become the next champion.<br><br>Split/Second is an arcade-focused racing game with fake-named sport cars inspired by real-world cars. But instead of just racing around the tracks and trying to be first just by out-thinking the other drivers, everyone has access to a so-called power play bar. By doing drifts, drafting (driving in the slipstream of another car) or avoiding an activated power play, the three sections of the bar fill up. While the first two are used to activate two level-1-power-plays, filling up the third will give the player access to a level-2-power-play.<br><br>If a section of the bar is filled, the player will see an icon above the cars ahead once they are in range of a power play. These power plays are for example a helicopter who drops exploding barrels or a parked car rigged to explode but also really big stuff like a train-bridge that goes up in flames or a whole ship sliding to the side. While the first two are level-1-power-plays, the second two are level-2-power-plays. Activating a Level-2-power-plays will also result in a change of the track. Once the ship has been blown up, the normal route is blocked by fire so the drivers have to use the deck of the ship as an alternate route. There are also often shortcuts on the track which are opened up by spending a level-1-power-play and will close a few seconds afterwards, crushing anyone who was foolish enough to follow the player (or whoever opened it up). The reason to use these power plays is simple: wrecking the opponent, either by letting him crash into things or shaking him up so much that he looses control of his car and crashes himself. Of course the player has to be careful. He too can be caught up in his own power play, loosing his advantage and more often then not even the entire race.<br><br>Besides the normal races, the game features several other game modes like "Destruction" in which the player has to get to the finish line as fast as possible while every power play on the track is automatically triggered. "Air Strike" on the other hand requires the player to dodge missiles shot by a helicopter flying ahead. The mode "Air Revenge" takes this even further, allowing the player to return those missiles to their origin.<br><br>During the course of the campaign, the player earns credits depending on which place he finished an event. By earning credits, the player automatically unlocks access to the final event of each episode, an elite race, and new cars. In addition the player unlocks special decals by doing crazy stuff like winning a race by a split-second. Each episode also features a bonus event which needs to be unlocked first by wrecking a certain amount of cars in the other events.<br><br>Split/Second features on all platforms a split-screen-mode for two players as well as online multiplayer for up to eight players with three different game modes available.

Description=Sports Champions is a compilation action-sports title meant to show off Sony's PlayStation Move motion controller in a similar vein to the Wii's Wii Sports. It contains a total of 6 sporting events that can be played either alone or with up to three friends. The events are:<br><br>1. Disc Golf - The goal of this game is to accurately throw a disc into a glowing pillar laying somewhere around the course. As the name implies this event is very similar to the game of golf, yet instead of swinging a golf club you are throwing a disc. The move controller detects everything from the angle of the disc to the power of your throw.<br><br>2. Gladiator Duel - In this event you go one-on-one against an opponent in an epic duel. Armed with a sword and shield your goal is to completely lower you opponents health before they do the same to you or before time runs out. Properly blocking fills up a special meter that once filled allows you to unleash a powerful combo attack. This can be played with either one or two motion controllers.<br><br>3. Archery - In this event you have to reach behind your back, grab an arrow, and fire away. The move controller allows you to feel like an archer and practice your accuracy skills. This can be played with either one or two motion controllers.<br><br>4. Beach Volleyball - In volleyball you get to control your characters actions but not it's movement. You have no saying on where your on-screen character can move, though at points you will have to do things like move the controller a certain way to make your character dive across the sand. This event is all about having perfect timing and placement with your partner in setting the ball and striking.<br><br>5. Bocce - In this event two players take turns throwing balls across a field trying to get it to land next to another ball. The player who lands their balls closer wins the round. Knowing tricks like twisting your arm and spinning the ball will help you to get the ball to where you want it.<br><br>6. Table Tennis - Table tennis is all about controlling a paddle to send a ball back and forth between players. It is like the sport of tennis except that it is played on a small table and uses paddles instead of rackets. The precision of the Move controller allows you to do moves like spins, lobs, and strikes very accurately. The goal of this game is to earn points by making your opponent miss your shots or send theirs out of bounds.<br><br>Each event contains a Champions Cup Mode. In Champions Cup Mode you must go against 10 opponents in increasing level of difficulties. Before you start the event you get to choose which character that you have unlocked to play with. There are three cups: bronze, silver, and gold, with gold being the most challenging. Having a quick time in events and not losing a lot of points allows you to earn up to three stars in each match. Having good scores allows you to gain trophies and also unlock things like new courses, clothing, items, and characters. There is also a Challenge Mode where you can play certain challenges to increase your score and a Free Play mode which you can play for fun with friends or just practice your skills.

Description=Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes bridges the gap between season one and two of the animated TV series. In the game the player learns more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunts down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska in a gameplay-style very simliar to Lego Star Wars.<br><br>The game is fully build around drop in/drop out-coop for two players. This means each mission in this 3rd-person-action-adventure features two famous characters from the TV series including Obi-Wan Kenobi, the padawan Asoka and Captain Rex but separated by class. The players either control commandos or Jedi-characters - never both mixed as they have totally different abilities and limitations. If no second player is available, the AI will automatically take over the second character and help overcome the many obstacles waiting ahead - mostly in form of several different kinds of separatist droids. While the players can use their lightsaber or blaster to fend them off, the Jedi-characters also have the ability to ride the droids by jumping onto them from behind. This is not only useful to blast through enemy lines but is also used to solve specific riddles preventing the characters from moving on. In addition the droids can be forced to dance with every other droid on the screen following his lead making them defenseless. These dances are unique for each droid and need to be bought first in the shop. Also available there: funny masks and combat upgrades like stronger blasters or a more powerful force-push.<br><br>To buy these things, the players have to unlock them first and then need to invest points which are gained by killing enemies as well as by successfully completing missions or the mini-games. These mini-games are scattered around the levels and turn up once a specific section has been completed. They mostly involve killing as many enemies as possible in a short amount of time. Each kill in succession both during normal gameplay and the mini-games also ranks up the multiplier adding even more points to the account. Once a player dies, he will respawn at the nearest checkpoint either immediately if he plays alone or after the second player has reached one - both times without any penalties.

Description=Effectively acting as Star Wars: Episode III and a half, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed puts players in the role of Darth Vader's Secret Apprentice in and all new adventure that bridges the gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. Armed with an over-the-top arsenal of Force powers, players follow the Apprentice through his journey of vengeance and redemption, villainy and heroism, as he travels the galaxy with the crew of his starship, the Rogue Shadow. Taken by Vader at a young age, the Secret Apprentice is raised as a slave of the Dark Side, but as he hurtles towards his destiny that will have far reaching implications for Star Wars continuity, he will discover much about his past and his future.<br><br>In the course of the game, the player will travel from planet to planet hunting down all remaining Jedi for Darth Vader. Each location (the junk planet Raxus Prime, densely forested Kashyyyk, organic fungal Felucia, and other surprise areas) has new enemies that require different Force powers to defeat, and so the player gains access to them at the start of each new level. For example, most enemies on Raxus are mechanical, so the player learns Force Lightning at the start of the level to exploit this. In addition to the Force Powers, players can use the customization screen to purchase different Force Combos, which combine lightsaber moves with Force Powers and even include several grapple moves. All of these abilities can be powered up in the customization screen, which also has options for tweaking the lightsaber and choosing among several different costumes.<br><br>The game rewards players for defeating enemies in flashy ways, using Force powers and the environment instead of simply hacking with the lightsaber. Different "bonuses" are awarded to the player based on how enemies were defeated - for example, a "Crush Bonus" for slamming an enemy into (and subsequently destroying) a piece of the environment, or a "Long Way Down Bonus" for sending an enemy flying off a cliff. These bonuses increase the player's Force Points, which work like experience points to level up; then once Level Up is achieved, the player receives Combo, Talent, and Ability spheres which can be spent on the aforementioned customization screen in order to gain new abilities and boost attack/defense-related stats. Additionally, the game makes use of an "Action camera" whenever enemies are defeated in particularly brutal ways, which briefly pauses the action to show an enemy hurtling to his death.<br><br>The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the Force Unleashed are the first games to use LucasArts' Ronin engine, which combines the Havok physics engine, Natural Motion's Euphoria AI, and Pixelux's Digital Molecular Matter (DMM), which allows enemies to react with fluid animation and self-preserving AI (such as grabbing on to ledges and dodging projectiles), and objects in the environment to bend, stretch and shatter based on their material properties. The versions for other versions simulate the effects, but do not actually include the modules.

Description=Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II picks up six months after the end of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. Starkiller, Darth Vader's secret apprentice, was killed by Darth Sidious after betraying his former masters and joining with the enemy.  Or so it seemed. Force Unleashed 2 begins with Vader walking into a large room with a prison cell in the middle. In it, is none other than Starkiller himself. Suffering from visions of a woman's voice and a burning forest, Vader tells him that those are memories of a dead man, and that he is actually a clone of the original Starkiller. Vader gives him a test to strike down a few training droids and Starkiller abides, but when asked to take out one that looks like Juno Eclipse, his love interest in part one, he couldn't do it. Being told that he failed just like the rest of the clones, Starkiller unleashes a powerful force lightning attack and escapes. The clone then sets off on a mission, to not only discover the truth about whether if he is a clone, but to also find the whereabouts of Juno Eclipse.<br><br>In the game, the player controls Starkiller in his quest to get the answers he wants. This will take him to a number of famous planets in the Star Wars universe including Kamino, the watery world home to the cloning facility; and Dagobah, the swamp infested planet housing one particular exiled Jedi. Starkiller is equipped this time with powerful dual lightsabers. An improvement to the game allows Starkiller to actually dismember his enemies with his lightsaber, which can result in stormtroopers with no arms or even no head. All force powers from part one return with a new upgrade mechanic to go along. Using Experience Points gained from killed enemies, the player can upgrade any force power up to the maximum of 3 levels. This includes the new force power known as Mind Trick, which Starkiller can use to take over the mind of the Empire's forces and make them do things such as attack their own allies or even commit suicide by jumping off buildings.<br><br>Holocrons return in this sequel and are scattered throughout each level. Finding one can lead to an upgrade in health or force energy, new lightsaber colors/powers, or even a new costume to equip you with. There is also a Challenge mode where the player can participate in a series of 10 challenges ranging from time trials to gauntlet trials (fighting waves of enemies). The faster you do the challenges, the higher of a score you will get; with the lowest being a Bronze medal and the highest being a Platinum medal. Doing the challenges also help to get new achievements/trophies.

It took more than 22 years to build but in the end it was acclaimed all around the world as the one symbol for hope and the ultimate proof that mankind can do anything. Well at least until they found the flaw in their perfect plan: Nature's ability to adapt.<br><br>Only known as the Happening, storms began to appear all over the planet. Stronger than anything mankind had ever seen they brought destruction and death upon the world. Whole cities where destroyed in just a few days and no end in sight. With no way to escape, the building of gigantic underground cryogenic sleep caverns began. Of course these caverns could only hold a privileged few and the rest was damned to stay on the surface, some starving to death, others going mad or killing each other.<br><br>But not everyone died. Many adapted, using everything that was left from the storm and over the centuries transformed into the Sai, humans that are one with nature. Meanwhile, deep down under the surface, the Echelon awaken from their sleep with the goal to reclaim their old planet.<br><br>Stormrise is a real-time strategy game without base building and a unique point of view. Similar to Tom Clancy's EndWar the camera always follows a squad. But instead of using voice commands to switch between everyone, a technology called "Whip Select" comes into play. Holding a specific button down brings up a beam. Moving the beam over the symbol of one of the squads and letting go then changes the camera position to that squad and then allowing the player to order that unit around with the help of the 3D-target cursor.<br><br>Instead of building a base and producing units there, the player starts with a pre-defined group of units in single player lead by Echelon-Commander Geary and a warp gate in multiplayer. Both modes also feature control points that automatically collect energy once captured. This energy is needed to call in reinforcements, upgrade units or outfit the control point with turrets, shields and such in three stages. It is even possible to create a second warp gate at the control point allowing the player to call reinforcements in closer to the front line.<br><br>Either at the start or after upgrading them, most of the nine available units on each side get access to alternate weapons like flame throwers and additional offensive and defensive tactics. The player can change the current load-out of a unit at any time with the help of a circular menu that shows up after a button press.

Produced by Yoshinori Ono, the game was launched following the positive response to Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting.<br><br>The game is chronologically set between the second and third main series and features a cast of well-known characters. The most important change is the visual style. Instead of choosing full 3D like the Tekken or Virtua Fighter series, SF IV stays true to it roots with stages on 2D planes. The characters are rendered in 3D with polygons similar to the Street Fighter EX series, but now with a hand-drawn touch of strokes and smudges, providing an effect of ink or paint in the visual design.<br><br>The gameplay is largely reminiscent of Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike with a six-button scheme for light, medium and heavy kicks and punches, throws, dashes, quick standing, combos and special moves. New to this game are Focus Attacks (Saving Systems in the Japanese version), based on two stances where an incoming attack can be absorbed and consequently countered. These attacks can be used to cancel out special moves, leading to new opportunities for combos and putting the emphasis into reading an opponent's move, rather than relying on strict combos. Regular special moves can be powered up through a super combo gauge. There is also a revenge gauge that is filled up by taking damage. When full, an ultra combo can be performed, with a long cinematic set of moves, often shown from a camera perspective that breaks away from the regular view.<br><br>Compared to the arcade version, the home version offers online multiplayer, new characters, both Japanese and English voice acting, animated introductions and endings for all characters, bonus stages, a new introduction, a challenge mode that introduces players to the basics, and downloadable content.<br><br>The set of playable characters includes:<br><br>1.

Description=Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is a special version of the arcade game Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. Character sprites and backgrounds have been cleaned up, and gems have been given an element and a visual effect to go with that element.<br><br>The core gameplay itself remains the same as the original game: players place gems of different colors into their Tetris-like bin, as fast as they can, in groups of two.  The player also receives glowing coloured orbs - if they place these next to a gem of the same color, the orb and all identical colored gems shatter, and any gems above fall.  The player's goal is to make this happen multiple times for each block placed, causing 'combos'.  The larger the combo, the more Counter Gems (gems with timers on them) are dumped into the opponent's bin.  If a player places multiple gems of the same color in a square or rectangular order, they merge together to become a larger single gem which increases the amount of Counter Gems that drop on the opponent's field.  Occasionally, a player will also receive a diamond - placing this on a colored gem will eliminate all gems in the player's bin of that color, increasing the potential for combos even more.<br><br>Similar to Super Puzzle Fighter II X for Matching Service, HD Remix includes multiple variants of gameplay:<br><br>1. X-Mode: Identical to the original arcade mode.<br>2. Y-Mode: Same-colored gems break as soon as there are three aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br>3. Z-Mode: Gems rise up from the bottom of the bin, and the player controls a 2x2 cursor to rotate them and create combos.<br><br>New to HD Remix is X'-Mode (or X Dash-Mode), which is a more fairly balanced version of the original game.

There are 5 worlds; Sky, Ice, Cave, Lava and Cloud, unlocked gradually and with different levels. Each narrow, winding course is played in mid-air and to complete a level the player has to guide the marble to the end where it boards a gyrocopter that transports it to the next course.<br><br>To solve the puzzles, the marble often needs to be rolled into Morphs that can switch the shape to four different balls: Marble, Metal, Air and Power, each with different abilities and characteristics. For instance, the Powerball can be charged in a generator, providing the ability to jump, dash, or magnetism. The Airball can be inflated with helium to reach higher areas. Supporting the AGEIA PhysX engine both through software and hardware, blocks can be pushed or topple down, cloth tears when the ball is too heavy and all kinds of items can be moved around. The nature of the puzzles changes with each game world, with fans, switches, and tubes.<br><br>The game is controlled through the mouse to move the ball, rotate and zoom. By holding down the left mouse button, the current speed is held to climb slopes or to move around without needing to move the mouse. Each level has gates that save the progress. When the ball drops down, the game is resumed for the last saved position. By completing courses quickly, players earn badges.

Description=Tales of Vesperia is the tenth game in the Tales of... series. The game's story takes place in the world of Terca Lumireis. This world is largely sustained by "blastia", a technology from an ancient civilization which can be used to perform a variety of tasks including powering the barriers which keep cities safe from monsters and helping knights in battle. After a war ten years ago, the world has settled into a more or less peaceful state consisting of the Empire which rules the land and various guilds which formed for those wishing to live outside the Empire's rule. The main character in the story is Yuri Lowell, a former Imperial Knight who now helps solve peoples problems in the lower quarter. After a blastia which regulates water flow in the lower quarter is stolen, Yuri attempts to catch the thief however ends up being thrown in jail instead. He then meets a mysterious girl named Estelle while escaping; she is coincidentally searching for Yuri's childhood friend Flynn, and from here their adventure begins.<br><br>The gameplay in Tales of Vesperia is similar to other Japanese RPG's and games in the series. The player controls Yuri as he explores various locations and the story unfolds. Often opponents (both human and monster!) can be seen on the screen and coming into contact will begin a battle. The battle system used is an updated variation from that in Tales of the Abyss. Battles are in real time and the player can move anywhere within the limited battle area. The player can run/walk, jump, guard, perform various basic attacks, utilize artes (more powerful magic attacks, however these are limited by the amount of the players technical points), and set the strategy computer controlled party members will use. Combo attacks are also possible where a series of normal and arte attacks are strung together to deal more damage to the enemy and prevent a counterattack. Successfully completing a battle allows players to level up. As players level up new skills are learned, attack abilities increase, hit points increase, and so on.

In an attempt to combat this threat, the military brings Skynet online to destroy the virus, unaware that the attack is actually a trick and soon after being brought online, Skynet becomes sentient and launches an attack on its biggest threat...mankind.  One hour after becoming sentient, it launches a nuclear barrage across the globe, striking key cities, destroying military assets and bringing mankind to the brink of destruction.  This day is known as Judgement Day.<br><br>Twelve years later, the survivors of Judgement Day are in desperate need of salvation as Skynet uses machines to hunt down and wipe out mankind.

Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.<br><br>Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.<br><br>You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.<br><br>It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.

Description=This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise.  Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation.<br><br>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.<br><br>PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.

Description=The 2008 edition in the Tiger Woods PGA series introduces enhancements and improvements to the previous version without major graphical or gameplay changes. There are new courses (Xbox 360/PS3: 5 new, 16 in total - PS2: 6 new, 18 in total) and different licensed professional golf players to choose from (21 on the Xbox 360/PS3 - 23 on the PS2/Wii).<br><br>The Xbox 360, PS2, PS3 and Windows versions allow players to import photos to create in-game faces on the characters based on custom images, using the Xbox Live Vision camera, PlayStation EyeToy, PlayStation Eye or a webcam. Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.<br><br>The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.<br><br>The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).<br><br>On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off. It can be used to influence air conditions, spin, or adds audio distractions. The controls are available in 3 modes: Full Swing (wii remote), Sitting Swing (new, waggle the wii remote) or the classic controls using the nunchuck for analog play. In Full Swing, twisting the wii remote adds hooks and slices prior to shots. Also exclusive to the Wii is a Miniputt mode.

Next to the two main modes, there are also Crisis missions and a number of shooting gallery mini-games.<br><br>The game comes with a Guncon 3 light gun controller, which uses infrared emitters instead of the cathode ray timing of the previous controllers.

Description=In the nearby future scientists develop a so-called Quantum suit that allows the carrier to travel through time. Two prototypes called Alpha and Betasuit are ready for testing when Aiden Krone enters the lab, steals the Alphasuit and makes a time-jump before he blows up the building. Luckily you were there and had the chance to jump into the Betasuit and activate the time travel before the building was destroyed. But it took the suit a second too long to jump so the explosion hit it and your jump didn't go as planned. When you wake up in an alley in the future you quickly realize that Krone has already declared himself leader of the world and transformed it into a totalitarian state with him as the dictator. Shortly after waking up, you are found by some rebels and you join their task in order to stop Krone and fix the timeline since your suit was too badly damaged by the blast.<br><br>Fight your way through hordes of enemies with futuristic, but also conventional weapons like pistols or shotguns. Your suit isn't rendered totally useless. It still allows you to slow down, rewind and forward time for a short period. This not only allows you to overcome obstacles like fire but you can also trick your enemies. Players can slow down the time and then steal the weapon out of the hand of an enemy - if he hasn't a too strong grip on it. This feature is also used for small time-related puzzles. <br><br>There are notable differences with the time manipulation element from the Prince of Persia series. Manipulating the time won't affect yourself and when you are too badly wounded and die, you can't just rewind. You remain dead and have to reload. The game also doesn't feature medipacks. Instead the hero just needs to rest for a second if he is wounded and will then be fully healed again.<br><br>Manipulating time is also part of the multiplayer-experience. Besides the normal game-modes Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, One-on-One and Capture the flag, the game also features King of Time and Meltdown Madness.<br><br>In King of Time there's a Time Sphere in the center of the map which makes you impervious to all time effects. To win the game you need to rack up kills while you have the item. Meltdown Madness instead requires of you to throw Chrono Grenades at the opposing team's machine to prevent it from functioning. Once a machine of a team has completed his countdown, that team wins.<br><br>The Chrono Grenades are also part of all the other game modes in addition to the Time Shield and the Time Resistance power-up. While the Chrono Grenades come in the three flavors and slow down, forward or rewind time in the area of the blast. The Time Shield not only makes you immune to time manipulation but also slows down every foreign object in a specific area which is good for dodging enemy fire. The Time Resistance power-up grants immunity against all time effects for a short period of time.

Soon betrayed by her employer, Lara Croft travels to Greece, Rome and Egypt to recover the other parts before this powerful device falls into the wrong hands.<br><br>Tomb Raider is a 3D action/adventure game in which players control Lara Croft from a third person perspective.  The camera follows Lara as she climbs, jumps, and swims through detailed environs overcoming environmental obstacles and deadly fauna.  Moving through levels often involves finding spots where Lara can climb, looking for spots where Lara can use her acrobatic ability, and sliding blocks and pushing levers to solve puzzles and open passageways.<br><br>Lara is armed with, now trademark, twin pistols with infinite ammunition, but she can pick up higher caliber weapons to take on deadlier human opponents.  Lara also comes across restorative health packs and has a compass with which she can orient herself.  Lara’s opponents include animals, gunmen, as well as primeval and supernatural beings.  Careful explorers can also find secret areas and avoid traps.

Description=In 2016 the unthinkable happens: An atomic war in Saudi Arabia not only kills over six million people but also disrupts the flow of the oil to the rest of the world. As a consequence, one year later America and Europe build a global missile defense network in space while Russia becomes the most important energy supplier and comes know the true promise of an economic boom making them once again a super power. Europe also units itself under the flag of the European Federation - but without the United Kingdom.<br><br>Now we write the year 2020 and the United States is almost finished building their Freedom Star, a orbital heavy weapons platform which once again will shift the balance of power on the planet and greatly increases the tension between the three super powers. It's only a matter of time until this tension unleashes itself in the last war mankind will ever fight: the EndWar.<br><br>Tom Clancy's EndWar is a real-time strategy game without base construction and single unit control. Instead the player orders squads of gunships, tanks and such around while being able to order reinforcements after a certain amount of time has passed. It is however wise for the player to look after his squads as they gain experience during the course of the battle and advance in six ranks after a successful battle making them more and more powerful. It is even possible to upgrade the units in the four categories "Attack", "Defense", "Mobility" and "Proficiency" with credits earned at the end of each mission.<br><br>What makes Tom Clancy's EndWar unique is the way how it is controlled. Instead of using a cursor, all actions are performed by voice command.<br><br>Each squad and hostile as well as important points on the map have numbers and letters assigned to them and the player uses these in combination of a few keywords to issue an order. If the player e.g. wants to send his first squad of gunships to attack the second squad of enemy infantry he has to press and hold a button to activate voice recognition, say "Unit 1 Attack Hostile 2" (in the English version) and release the button. If the system understood the order it is then carried out. It is also possible to issue a series of orders by completing the first order without releasing the button. The system will then await the following orders to be spoken before activating them all upon the release of the button.<br><br>To make it easier for the player to know what he can say, an onscreen pop-up window opens up as the player progresses through the command chain showing all possible words that can  be used in the current context.<br><br>During all this the camera always follows a squad. Freely moving around the battlefield is not possible. Instead the player jumps around with the command "Unit Number Camera" or activates the overview map called "Sitrep" which shows a abstract real-time map of the battlefield.<br><br>The single player campaign puts the player in control of all three armies while fighting battles all over the world against an unknown terrorist group. The game also features 1on1 and 2on2 skirmishes with bots, cooperative campaign play and a permanent online World War III-scenario in which thousands of players fight for world domination by joining one of the three factions and help conquering and defending points on the world map. These include air force bases which give access to air strikes and additional infantry units and capital cities that have to be conquered in three stages. Once a day a campaign-update rolls out which updates the map to reflect the territorial changes based on the battles fought in the last 24 hours.<br><br>As opposed to the the console-versions, the windows release also allows for control with mouse and keyboard, features an updated UI and camera and includes several new missions and multiplayer maps.

Description=Like its predecessor Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown, Vegas is a more action-driven tactical shooter. You play as Logan Keller who is the leader of a Rainbow Six-Squad. Controlling two team-members, you have to take on terrorists who attempt to get the city of Las Vegas under their control.<br><br>The missions are all connected with one another through the storyline. You always have different goals like rescuing a hostage or disarming a bomb. To do so, you have access to different kinds of weapons from pistols to Assault Rifles and Gadgets like C4 or Tear Gas. You order your men around by aiming at something and then choosing from a list of options called "Rules of Engagement", available in a circle menu much like in Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter. They will then do they best to fulfill your order without risking their own lives by taking cover as often as possible.<br><br>Instead of a health indicator and medi-packs scattered around the map, your vision blurs when you get a hit. If you take too many, you die but if you take cover and wait a while, you recover and can once again take on the terrorists.<br><br>Compared to earlier versions, there are fewer enemies, but they are harder to kill due to the improved AI. The mission planning has been removed, for the first time weapons can be picked up from dead enemies, and the aiming system has been altered. The story is no longer told to cutscenes as the plot now advances through scenes during gameplay.<br><br>If you have saved Las Vegas or are tired of the AI, you can engage in the multiplayer-modes available for up to 15 other players like Assault & Defend, in which one team needs to take over an objective, defended by the other team, or just plain Deathmatch in the Sharpshooter mode. You can also play through the singleplayer story with friends or go on a hunt for terrorists on random generated maps.

Under the command of Team Leader Bishop a second squad cleared the backyards of the city while the other team enjoyed themselves in the casinos. The player takes control over Bishop and visits the other, dirty side of Las Vegas.<br><br>The gameplay hasn't changed since the first title so the game again puts four team mates at the player's side which he can give orders with the tactical interface including "Move to" or"Use Gadget". As he moves through the enemy infested areas, getting covered by his team, defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, two of the new features become evident: the Persistent Elite Creation (P.E.C.) and the Advanced Combat Enhancement Specialisation (ACES).<br><br>The P.E.C. allows the player to build a unique identity and save his progress from one match to another. Both in single and in multiplayer the player gains experience for killing bad guys and successfully completing objectives. Has he gained enough experience for the next rank, he will unlock new weapons, body armour and other more or less useful items. The ACES-system takes it a step further and rewards you a big chunk of experience and powerful weapons if the player completes challenges inside one of three categories: Marksman, Close Quarters and Assault. These challenges range from simply completing a specific Story Mode map to making a bunch of head shots in a row.

Description=In Sam Fisher's first next generation adventure, the splinter cell has a tragedy befall him.  Shortly thereafter, Sam's life collapses around him.  He becomes more distant from Third Echelon.  In fact, he even goes so far as to get himself arrested.<br><br>But it's all part of the plan.  Sam Fisher is now a double agent, working for both the NSA and a terrorist organization known as the JBA, or John Brown's Army.  Sam is for the most part a good guy still.  But will that remain?  Will Sam do good for the NSA and bring the organization to justice, or will the lure of the terrorist group overpower and overcome Sam?<br><br>The choices you make affect that outcome.  Moral questions will pop up in various places throughout the game.  Do you shoot a prisoner to earn trust with the JBA, or do you hold off, keeping the NSA on your side?  Whatever outcome you decide on, your trust with one will go down and the other will go up.  This trust system is a new addition to Double Agent.<br><br>As you work your way through ten missions, your best friends are shadow and silence.  You can go in guns blazing, but you won't get far.  As a master spy, Sam will have to sneak around crates and walls, hide under vehicles and tables, sneak through highly guarded areas, and bypass electronic, fingerprint, voiceprint and retinal locked doors.  You must interrogate or hack for keycodes and combinations, and you have the choice of knocking an enemy unconscious or killing them.  When hanging by a rail, you can let an enemy guard walk by, or reach up, grab him and throw him to his death.  Your best weapon is your mouth.  Lure an enemy to your location by whistling, then sneak around him as he abandons his patrol to find the source of the noise.  Your configurable weapon is really a backup.<br><br>Sam will go on many missions as a double agent.  You'll be visiting the JBA headquarters in New York City, you'll travel to the Congo to rescue a soldier, you'll board a cruise ship in Cozumel wearing shorts in broad daylight with minimal cover, forcing you to change your stealth patterns.  You'll wind up in the middle of a wartorn city, in the middle of a battle between guerrillas and the military, both of which want you dead.  Your missions are varied, and all can be completed without firing a single bullet.<br><br>Multiplayer is similar to the past Splinter Cell games.  You take on the role of either a spy or a mercenary; spies are played from the standard, third-person perspective, while mercs are played from the first-person perspective.  Spies are tasked with stealing sensitive documents; mercs are tasked with killing the spies and protecting the documents.  Each side has its own unique weapons and items.  Spies do not have conventional weaponry, meaning nothing that can kill a merc, but they have several gadgets and devices to help them.  Mercs are blessed with a high-powered rifle, grenades, and the ability to toggle various vision modes.<br><br>The PS3 version includes some additional content: a new female spy character (multiplayer), two new maps based on a new environment (multiplayer), a new set of co-op challenges and some refinements for the existing content.

Description=The third game in the Top Spin series updates the concept of the previous two tennis titles with some new features. The most important change is that more control is given back to the player, levelling the difficulty. In the previous version the AI took control of timing and positing, players only needed to press a button for shots, and keeping it pressed longer made them harder. In this edition the player controls the power of the shot, the positioning of the player and the timing needed to perform a successful swing. When the player needs to run to reach the ball, it will never be as precise as powerful as when already in position. Most of these changes are gradually introduced in the tennis school, where players are trained to become familiar with the new controls.<br><br>There are about twenty professional players, modelled after their real-like counterparts and with signature styles. Famous players such as Roger Federer and Justine Henin are present, along with a few legends such as Boris Becker, Björn Borg and Monica Seles. Not all legends are available at the same time for all three platforms (including Wii). An editor is included to design custom characters. There are dynamic weather changes and the players' costumes show traces of grass or dirt as the match progresses. In the same vein, the player faces show how they are sweating after playing for some time.<br><br>Next to regular matches, there is a full career mode where the player starts with very low statistics. These can be upgraded by training and playing matches, but they can never all be pushed to the maximum. Instead players need to choose to train for some powerful abilities or decide to become a more all-round player. This is mostly reflected in the amount of winners based on forehands or backhands for instance.<br><br>Along with quick matches, the world tour is also supported online. The world ranking starts over every fortnight and is not continued endlessly like the previous version. Some of the tournaments are the US Open, Australian Open en Roland Garros, but Wimbledon has not been included. There are various difficulty levels, six camera modes and the graphics are more detailed than the previous versions.

Description=Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a videogame adaptation of the 2009 sequel blockbuster of the same name and has some features from its predecessor along with some newer features.  The story takes place two years after the first movie/game as the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, are working in tandem with a team of American and British forces called N.E.S.T. along with many of Earth's governments.  Their goal is to root out and destroy Decepticons who have stayed behind after the fall of Megatron, but they are encountering resistance at every turn.<br><br>At the same time, the human protagonist, Sam Witwicky, is trying to lead a normal life and heads off to college unaware that soon he, along with all of Earth, will be involved in a battle that will have an army of awaiting Decepticons invade Earth, the resurrection of a familiar foe, a mysterious enemy simply named "The Fallen" and a secret that can bring about the destruction of all life on Earth.<br><br>Like in the previous game the player can choose to be either Autobots or Decepticons, each with their own campaign and locations from both the movie along with new locations created to expand the game.  The events of each campaign does have elements from the movie, but also has additionally missions devoid from the film to fill in the game.<br><br>However unlike the first game, this version has a more non-linear storyline in which the player can choose which missions they want to partake in any order.  These missions take place in "zones" and once a player has accomplished all the missions within a zone they can choose to explore that area in a free roam mode without having to repeat missions.<br><br>There is also online capabilities along with downloadable content and five different multiplayer modes.  Deathmatch allows up to eight players in a free-for-all while Team Deathmatch has two teams of four fight it  out.  One Shall Stand is a variation of Team Deathmatch, except the goal is to eliminate the opposing teams leader and  Control Points has two opposing teams fight it out for control of certain marked areas, earning points for more territories conquered.  Battle for the Shards is a Capture-the-Flag variation where two teams seek out shards of the Allspark and bring them back to their home base to receive points.

Description=In Trash Panic, the main goal of the game is to clear six stages from a variety of trash. The trash itself is constantly being moved on a suspended conveyor belt. This conveyor belt eventually leads the trash to hang over a gigantic trash can. Now it's up to the player to throw all this trash into the trash can, but the player has to be careful not to overfill the trash can or it's game over.<br><br>The trash itself varies in size and shape, plus have other properties such as being flammable or decomposable. Also, heavier items can crush and compact the lighter and more fragile objects. The player also has to be careful not to compact certain pieces of thrash, like jewelery, or else penalty trash will be released which will take up available space. Near the end of each stage, the game will drop a large boss item that will have to be compacted within a certain amount of time, or else more penalty trash will fall to fill in the trash can. <br><br>An important gameplay mechanic is learning to control fire. Since the trash can be burned, players can slam the lid of the trash can shut while the fire is inside setting things ablaze. This will cause the temperature to rise burning even the more fire resistant items. Of course, this will lower the oxygen meter which will eventually put the fire out if it drops too low. So the player has to try to balance the rise of the heat with the lid closed against the chances of the dropping oxygen levels extinguishing the fire. The player also has to be on the lookout for trash that contains water, as that will obviously have a negative effect on the fire also.<br><br>The game keeps track of the player's Eco and Ego score which get affected by the way the player deals with the trash. Decomposing and compacting trash naturally will increase the Eco score, while burning the trash will increase the Ego score. Keeping the Eco score high is important because it will unlock extra levels and modes.<br><br>The game modes included are the main six stage mode, an unlimited mode where the trash will keep coming indefinitely, and a mission mode where players are tasked with fulfilling a number of waste management missions such as having to ring a large bell 100 times or play with a smaller trash can than usual. There is also a 2 player versus mode. The game also comes with three difficulty levels to choose from.

Description=When the king dies, there is no one to take the throne and the unspecified kingdom is left without a ruler. Soon, chaos ensues as the dead rise from their grave and take over the nation, driving everyone away. In this abandoned country, the lives of three characters become entwined. The thief Zoya make use of the situation to infiltrate the Astral Academy to steal riches. She discovers an artifact that glues her to the object, unable to move. Her fate is shared by Amadeus the wizard. Through an unfortunate experiment he was in a deep sleep and when he awakes he finds out everyone has left. As a light comes from a shrine in the academy, he discovers the thief and makes the same mistake. Finally there is Pontius the noble knight. More muscle than brains, he has bravely stayed behind to defend the academy, but he too, when discovering the duo, touches the object. The wizard recalls that the artifact is called The Thrine, with the magical power to connect souls. Against their will, the three characters are now bound in their fate, their lives connected, and need to find a way to undo the powers. They explore the kingdom, looking for traces of the Guardian who is said to control the powers of The Trine.<br><br>Trine is a physics-based action game where the strengths of each of the three characters need to be used cooperatively to complete puzzles and advance. When playing alone, the player can switch between any of the three characters at any time, but the game can also be played offline with three players simultaneously, each controlling one of the characters on the same screen, similar to the Lost Viking series. The game uses 2D-sidescrolling gameplay, but with many different layers in the front and the back that provide depth, and a camera that zooms dynamically. Each of the three characters has specific abilities. The thief is able to grapple wooden surfaces and uses bow and arrow to attack enemies, or fire arrows to light torches. The wizard uses his magic to move objects, and he is also able to create planks and crates. The knight is the blunt force, relying on his sword and shield to take care of enemy threats, and he is also able to lift and move heavy objects. The three characters constantly need to work together to get past obstacles and often there are multiple solutions. The environment is physics-based, with objects that can be stacked and swung, and breakable surfaces.<br><br>There are also minor RPG elements to the game, as green potions provide experience. The characters can be leveled up for each of their three possible skills. Levels are also filled with hidden locations that often contain chests with items that enhance the characters' abilities. That way, they can resurrect, breathe underwater or get better resistance against damage. Levels contain multiple checkpoints. When one of the characters dies, it is possible to continue as the perished ones are revived at the next checkpoint. The characters can also collect health and blue potions that refill magic (drained by shooting fire arrows or using magic for instance). The focus is on puzzle solving and platform jumping, but there are many instances with different types of enemies such as skeletons, bats and boss characters, next to more general traps.

The mission that leads to the events of the game was simple: find Roland Kane (leader of Wolf Pack, and your former mentor) and bring him back to earth. However, things turned ugly, as the ship was hit by a missile and crashed on the back-water planet. Even worse, it becomes apparent that scientists from The Mendel Gruman Corporation have been terra-forming the planet for Excellerated Evolution, resulting in dinosaurs hunting you, your allies, and your enemy. Joesph Turok's mission is to survive at all costs.<br><br>Gameplay is about surviving in dangerous environments with both human soldiers and dinosaurs. The dinosaurs can be used as a tool to eliminate soldiers by luring them. All weapons have secondary functions such as a flares to lure dinos. Turok can also choose a stealthy approach with arrows and his trusty knife, in the form of brutal kills. Online multiplayer is also featured, with all the weapons from the single-player game, and some maps have dinos and giant scorpions. The gameplay modes include classics like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and all-new modes borrowed from objective-based war games, such as Assault Capture the flag, and co-op missions. They all have a little twist to them, such as CTF putting a lure on the "flag carrier" that draws dinos to the player.

This time it's basically FIFA 08 modified to let the player experience this summer's European Championship. <br><br>Euro 2008 lets you control any European national football team in many different ways.

This is basically a slightly modified version of the "be a pro"-mode from FIFA 08.<br><br>You can also try different challenges and tournament modes in order to unlock extras or just test your abilities. You can play through the full championship experience, including the qualifying stages, or you can skip ahead to the group stages. You can also play a very extensive challenge mode where you try to make you nation the best in European football by clearing different challenges against all the other European teams. <br><br>As with FIFA 08 the PC and console versions are quite different. In fact, they are based on completely different game engines. While the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3-versions boasts state of the art graphics and a new and improved control system, the PC-version still basically looks and functions like the 2006-version.

Description=Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is the sequel to Naughty Dog's 2007 well-received hit, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. The story picks up a few years where the first one left off, following the previous games fortune hunting hero, Nathan Drake, as he searches around the globe to try to solve another of the world's unsolved historical mysteries; this time regarding the famous merchant/explorer Marco Polo, who in 1292, mysteriously came back from a journey having lost 13 ships and 500+ passengers, with no explanation ever given on what had happened to those ships. After Drake gains knowledge of an ancient relic and a mysterious Himalayan Valley that may be connected to Marco Polo, he sets out on an adventure to discover the secrets of Polo's lost fleet, which he hopes will lead him to one of history's greatest undiscovered treasures.<br><br>The gameplay of Uncharted 2 remains pretty similar to that of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. It consists of cover-based shoot-offs, fast-paced escape sequences and death-defying stunts fairly reminiscent of those of the Indiana Jones movies. Some notable improvements to Among Thieves include stealth-action segments in the game, which force you to move through certain areas hiding in cover from the hordes of pirates who await to kill you. The wall-climbing and cover mechanics have been heightened to a new extent, allowing free movement over walls and more items for Drake to use as protection.<br><br>Multiplayer modes have been added for the first time in the Uncharted series. Among Thieves features both competitive and co-operative play, allowing you to play the game along with friends and people around the world. Competitive game modes include &quot;Deathmatch (Team Deathmatch)&quot;, &quot;Plunder (Capture the Flag)&quot;, &quot;Elimination&quot; and &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;. Co-operative includes a mode called &quot;Gold Rush&quot;, in which you along with two other people must work as a team to face off against waves of enemy AI as you guys try to capture treasures and return them back to your base. Each round will not only have more enemies, but they will also be a lot stronger to.

Description=Warhawk, a remake of the game PSX launch title of the same name, is a multiplayer-only futuristic combat game, in the style of the Battlefield or Tribes series. Combat focuses on up to 32 players piloting Warhawks (the game's Harrier-jet-like aircraft) in large-scale acrobatic dogfights using the motion-sensing features of the SIXAXIS controller.  However, at any time, players can park their aircraft and continue the fight on foot (using firearms, grenades, knives and surface-to-air missile launchers) or in a ground-based vehicle (jeeps, tanks and a variety of turrets).  Supported game modes at release include classic deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and a zone-based territory capture mode.  Updates are planned through 2008 which include new game modes, maps, vehicle and weapon updates.<br><br>The game was meant to include a single-player scenario, but this was eventually scrapped in favour of the multiplayer part. Offline, there is a four way split-screen mode. The game can be downloaded from the PlayStation Store, but there is also a more expensive retail version that includes extra content such as behind-the-scenes developer interviews, and a Jabra BT125 (North America) or Jabra BT135 (Europe) Bluetooth headset.

Description=Way of the Samurai 3 follows the same principles as its predecessors and is once again designed to offer an authentic settings, a deep sword-fighting system, and cause-and-effect role-playing. This time around the game takes place during the Sengoku Period and puts the players into the sandals of a lone samurai. As the only survivor of an epic battle, he enters the world of Amana which is currently ruled by Shuzen Fujimori who had overthrown the former superior Lord Sakurai. But the Fujimori Clan isn't very liked in the region so Shuzen has to rule the area with an iron fist in order to keep control.<br><br>The player is thrown into this struggle and has to decide if he wants to join Fujimori Clan, Ouka Clan (formed by former members of the Sakurai Clan), protect the villagers in Takatana who just want peace or just get out of Amana for good (which will lead to a complete reset of the game). The game offers the player almost complete freedom to roam the eight zones of Amana while looking over the shoulder of his avatar. The overall story arc allows for over 20 possible endings. Which one the player gets, depends on his actions and choices throughout the game - including if he always bumps into people, making them angry and attack the player. To that end, the length of the game greatly varies depending on what the player does. The shortest way e.g. would be to just go and kill both faction leaders which can theoretically be done in less than an hour thanks to the ability to often even act during cut-scenes and dialogues. <br><br>While they play out and even during normal gameplay, the player has three choices: listen, apologise/beg or attack. Begging a merchant will earn the player a free item but will also greatly reduce the respect the merchant has for the player which in the end may lead to less Samurai Points after death or completion of the game. The game is divided into different scenes with the next possible ones marked on the in-game map, making it easier for the player to follow the red ribbon.<br><br>The game features a realistic day and night cycle which has a great affect on the NPCs who live their ordinary lives even without the player interfering. The player can talk to various characters, accept different jobs (only one at a time) and shop for new items. In addition are also a few mini-games like chopping up vegetables or fillet fish. Decisions influence the relationships with the different groups changing the way they interact with the player and there are dozens of swords, hammers and spears to choose with which he can defend himself. He has to to keep the variable quality and durability level in mind though. With these weapons, the player can perform both offensive and defensive moves depending on his fighting style, and even special actions. There are several dozen moves available for unlock which will even stay available for each new game. More importantly the player can decide if he wants to kill an person or fight with a blunt weapon. While killing can be bad for the reputation, throwing down an enemy only with a blunt attack will result in another meeting further down the road for sure. If the right weapon isn't dropped by an enemy, the player can go to the blacksmith and forge a new one out of spare parts or enhance and upgrade an existing one, according to his fighting style and in exchange for money. <br><br>During the course of the game, the player will also meet several possible partners. While some will join him in exchange for money, other can be "romanced". In any case the person will then follow the player around, giving him an additional edge in combat and also unlocking access to mini-games and side jobs which can only be done with two people. The romance with the partner can even go as far as the partner deciding to live with him in his home in Takatane village. There the player can sleep till a certain hour in order to restore his health and has access to a weapons safe as well as a closet where he can story his stuff as he can only carry three weapons at a time and no additional clothing.

Description=Rubi Melone calls herself a problem solver. Others would call her a mercenary. For enough money she does what she's told without asking questions and going over corpses to reach her goals. But one day a guy called Robert Pelham has the guts to double-cross her - a huge mistake. Mad as hell she goes out on a search for vengeance, traveling over several continents and going through hordes and hordes of minions. The whole game is envisioned like a Grindhouse movie with scratches all over the screen, missing scenes, a high amount of blood and gore and a high focus on staged action scenes.<br><br>Similar to John Woo presents Stranglehold, WET is a third-person-shooter with a strong focus on acrobatic stunts. While Rubi can kill enemies with her assortment of four different types of weapons (two pistols with unlimited ammo, two shotguns, two machine pistols and two crossbows) just by walking around shooting, she doesn't do much damage that way and is very slow. Instead she needs to jump around, slitter across the flow or walk on the walls which instantly slows down time until she touches the floor again. During these moves she can also use both of her weapons to target one enemy automatically while manually using the crosshair to target another. For every kill she makes she gets points and depending on how fast and how "stylish" she kills enemies, her points multiplier increases up to x5. The multiplier is especially important, since Rubi only regenerates health when her the multiplier is active, making her nearly invulnerable once she reaches and successfully holds x5. The only other way to regenerate health is to drink from whiskey bottles scattered around the levels. Earned points are used to buy new moves or upgrade existing ones as well as her weapons. She also has access to a sword which she uses as a door-opener and to cut down enemies in melee combat.<br><br>Besides the normal combat and the action/adventure-like climbing and jumping exercises in-between, there are simple quick-time events for bossfights and other scripted events and the so-called Rage-mode. At certain, pre-defined points in the game, Rubi kills an enemy at close range and gets blood all over her face. This drives her mad and turns the realistic graphics into a red-black-white cartoon-style world. During rage-mode, Rubi is nearly invulnerable, is faster and hits harder - but also has to deal with many many more enemies. Once the player has finished the game, additional difficulty settings are unlocked including an arcade-mode where each enemy can only take one bullet and Rubi also has considerably less health. In addition a points-mode, in which the player can select each level of the story-mode and try to beat his highscore, and Rubi's home are unlocked. At Rubi's home, an abandoned plane-graveyard, several different challenges await the player like getting from A to B in the fastest time possible, or shooting targets for points.

Milo is also an undercover-agent sent to Barcelona to infiltrate the local underworld but he soon finds himself between the fronts of an all-out gang war between three rival groups.<br><br>The player takes on the role of Milo Burik looking over his shoulder while freely walking and driving around the city. As a Wheelman Milo doesn't just drive his car or motorcycle he also uses them as a weapon. By swinging the mouse or using one of the sticks, the player rams his car into other cars until they go up in flames. It also allows him to quickly switch lanes or ram through barricades. By destroying other vehicles, speeding and generally reeking mayhem in the city, the player also fills up his focus power which is needed for special attacks. Utilizing this power allows him to get a speed boost, get perfect aim at high speeds or perform a 180° turn, aim and destroy his chaser with one shot. But his car isn't Milo's only weapon. Pistols, machine guns and such too await to be used outside and inside cars and if his own car is about to blow up or if he just doesn't like the color anymore, he can perform an air jack. An air jack is possible once Milo's car is close enough to another car or motorcycle. After releasing the corresponding button, he then jumps over, removes the original driver and continues on his journey in his new vehicle.<br><br>All this is used to advance in the main storyline as well as in the many side-missions the player can take on. These range from Taxi-missions in which the player needs to get a passenger to his goal as fast as he can, to rampages in which destruction is everything and capture and delivery missions in which Milo needs to use his air jack ability to steal a specific vehicle and get it to the drop point in time. In common have all that at the end the player is rated based on his performance with "S" being the highest rank and "C" the lowest. If the player managed to get at least an "A" he unlocks additional missions and ultimately access to additional repair shops and weapon depots. Once unlocked the next story mission as well as every side-activity can be accessed directly from the city map on the PDA.

Himmler's Paranormal Division knows about the Veil and build several portals in Isenstadt to go from the real world to other, giving them an advantage in the battle over Isenstadt. But to enter the Veil, one needs a special medallion. Without it you turn into a monster once you leave the Veil. In addition the medallion grants it's wearer special powers. Of course the Office of Secret Actions can not allow the Nazis to get access to such powers and sends in their best agent: B. J. Blazkowicz. But although he manages to steal the medallion, the Nazis are already on the brink of being able to artificially create such a medallion in the lab. Of course B. J. can't let them succeed and joins the fight.<br><br>Wolfenstein is a 1st-person-shooter with the player shooting his way through hordes and hordes of different types of Nazis ranging from normal soldier to ninjas. To deal with his many enemies, the player has access to many typical WWII-weapons like the German MP40 or K98 rifle. In addition, during the course of the game he finds the medallion and learns four powers. While at first he can only enter the Veil which allows him so see enemies more clearly and use strange flying creatures as bombs, he's later able to slow down time, surround himself with a protecting shield or make himself stronger. But the medallion's powers can't be always used. Instead each of the powers drain it's energy which needs to be refilled at, in the real world almost invisible power-spots. After each mission, the player is free to roam Isenstadt, talk to NPCs to get new missions and visit the Black Market. Hidden in the levels for the player to find is Intelligence Material and gold in various forms. While the intel offers additional insides into the story and it's characters, the gold is used at the Black Market to buy new weapons, ammunition and weapons-upgrades like silencers or bigger clips. Both collecting intel and gold unlocks additional upgrades.<br><br>The game also features class-based multiplayer-modes for up to twelve players. The available classes are the soldier, who shoots first and asks questions later. The Engineer, who is the only one who can fulfill all the objectives. And the Medic who can heal and resurrect fallen allies. The available multiplayer-modes are Team Deathmatch, Objective and Stopwatch. In Objective the Resistance has to destroy research and experiments by the Axis with them having to stop them. In Stopwatch the objective is the same but in addition the time it takes the Resistance to stop the Axis is counted and after the round ends, the teams switch sides and in order to win the round, the other team then needs to be faster than the first.

Description=Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!<br><br>In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.<br><br>Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.<br><br>Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).<br><br>Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).

Description=A sequel to the 2007 downloadable version of Worms, (and not a combination of the previous games Worms 2 and Worms: Armageddon as the title might imply), Worms 2: Armageddon adds a new 30-mission campaign, three tutorials, and five secret missions. 40 weapons are available, including returning favorites (the sheep variants and the Holy Hand Grenade), and some new additions (a Bunker Buster and the Buffalo of Lies).<br><br>Players control a team of armed worms fighting atop a 2-D randomized battlefield. Players take turns controlling one worm at a time, and can either position the worm until time runs out, or use one weapon from a selectable menu.  Direct fire weapons (shotguns, Uzis) are used by the worm that selected it against whatever's nearby.  Thrown weapons (grenades, bazookas) are aimed by the player and affected by ever-changing wind.  Explosive weapons (airstrikes, bombs) blow holes in the terrain and drop any nearby worms into the new craters.<br><br>Most weapons have a limited number of uses per map.  Each individual worm on the team has their own health meter, and will die when it reaches zero or they are knocked off the terrain and into the water.  The team that loses all its worms loses the match.<br><br>Players can compete against the single-player A.I., or against each other online or off.  Multiplayer features different game types (deathmatch, forts, and races), with leaderboards for each.  Players also unlock customization options as they play through the single-player campaign, allowing them to create new teams with custom names, hats,  voices, and attitudes.

Description=At the beginning of time, two divine entities ruled over the universe peacefully and harmoniously. But one day the seeds of conflict rained from the sky and the entity known as The Dark, tried to take all the power for himself. The Light and The Dark battle fiercely but The Light couldn't defeat The Dark and stop the chaos. They were both inseparably connected to one another and so The Light realized that the only way to stop The Dark was to banish him and himself into two cursed artifacts. Each one is now guarding the artifact containing the powers of the other and all seems well. At least until one day a egocentric treasure hunter named Ayumi finds the map to the hidden temple where the artifacts are guarded.<br><br>In her greed she ignores the warnings of The Light, touches the artifact and by doing so unleashes The Curse upon herself. It enters her body and condemns her to pain and suffering. But not all is lost. The Curse hasn't full control over her yet. Withstanding it, Ayumi continues to search her search for the second artifact. But now not because of greed but to battle The Dark, confine it's powers again and relieve herself of The Curse by doing so.<br><br>The journey is not an easy one as the player takes over the control of Ayumi, looking over her shoulder and guiding her through the levels. The return of The Dark spawned many enemies on the island. But as an experienced treasure hunter, Ayumi isn't defenseless. With her gunblades in her hands, she mows through the enemies like Dante does in the Devil May Cry series until the entrance to the next level unlocks. Each defeated enemy then drops one or more souls which Ayumi needs to buy additional skills, spells and items allowing her to cast fireballs upon her enemies or buy more powerful bullets for the gunblades. This is especially important as all the enemies and bosses have different weaknesses. The phantoms e.g. are immune to physical damage but hitting them with a fireball or fire-induced blades will destroy them in no time.<br><br>Scattered around the temple are also artifacts which were broken into three pieces. If Ayumi finds all three, she reunites them and gains either a melee, pistol or airstrike upgrade increasing her respective damage and granting her access to more powerful combos.

Description=X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Uncaged Edition) is the release for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC and differs greatly from the version for Wii, PlayStation 2, PSP and NDS which is just called X-Men Origins: Wolverine.<br><br>The game follows the story of the movie of the same name detailing the background of Logan aka Wolverine before he joined the X-Men. Starting on the last mission of the elite military force known as Team X, the player witnesses Kayla's death, escapes from Weapon Factory X with his new reinforced skeleton and ultimately helps Wolverine to have his revenge on Victor Creed aka Sabretooth. In between dozens of enemies including a few boss fight require extensive use of the famous steel blades. Wolverine makes use of several different combos and finishers while slashing through his enemies converting his normal light and hard attacks into serious damage. Often it's even possible to incorporate the environment into the cause of death of an enemy by throwing him onto a spike or something similarly hurtful. The player has also access to four Fury Attacks. These attacks are very powerful but require rage in order to be executed. Rage on the other hand is collected simply by killing enemies. In addition the game makes use of Quick Time Events to unfold scripted cinematic sequences.<br><br>By killing enemies Logan gains experience points (including a multiplier if he defeats them in rapid succession) as well as by finding dog tags hidden on dead soldiers around the levels. Once he has gained enough experience Wolverine advances a level, gaining not only more health but also skill points. These can then be used to learn new combos or increase the strength of already known ones. Besides the dog tags, Wolverine's old suits from the comics are hidden in the levels. Finding all of them unlocks bonus challenges and allows the player to use the corresponding suit in the normal game.
