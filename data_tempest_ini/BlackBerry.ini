Description=3D Lawn Darts takes the classic game of lawn darts and brings it to mobile devices.  Lawn darts is a game played outside where you lob big metal darts at a circle on the ground.  The game was banned in the United States and Canada because of all the injuries.<br><br>The unique thing with 3D Lawn Darts (besides having a full 3D game on a mobile device) is that it uses real motion for throwing the darts.  The way this works is that the mobile device must have a camera that the game can use.  Then during the game, it vibrates to let you know to toss the dart.  Once the person feels the vibration, he/she then makes a throwing motion while a picture is taken.  The game then analyzes the pictures blur to decide where the dart goes.  Once the motion is made he/she can view the screen and follow the dart in the 3D world through the air till it hits the target.<br><br>Besides the motion other features of the game are choice of 3D world (4 choices), choice of player to throw the dart (4 choices again) and different types of darts to throw.  Dart choices include flaming darts, nuclear darts, magnetic darts, and more.

Description=Just like the console versions, AND 1 Streetball brings basketball to the streets. Clearly steering away from the search for realism in EA's NBA Live series, this game offers an arcade approach, with two-on-two games, fantasy moves and slamming dunks, rough play, and hip hop-themed announcers. Next to quick games (runs), the main game mode is the AND 1 Challenge. In six series of two games, you select and play different streetball legends. By winning matches, new characters and courts are gradually unlocked.<br><br>Next to the regular movement, there is a key to shoot, block and dunk, one to pass or steal, another to perform a trick or to push an opponent, and a final one to perform an alley-oop or to switch the defenders. Various parameters are added. To get a better shot, you need to hold the shoot key pressed until the ball glows green, alley-oops need precise timing with another meter, and you can also go for a return. By holding certain keys, players can perform auto-defense, auto-block or auto-steal. The dunks are over-the-top, with a replay mode, and by scoring multiple points players become "on fire", with more spectacular effects similar to the NBA Jam games. Matches are rather short, and the various settings can be fine-tuned in the options.<br><br>The basics are explained in a 10-step tutorial, and the game's theme song is a digitized version of Sean Paul's "We Be Burnin".

There are four different weapons available during the game: a sword, bombs, a crossbow and a grappling hook. Some of these need to be recharged or can only be used at specific places. While fighting, Altaïr can block, attack or go for a one-hit kill by timing precisely. Health can be restored through vials and collecting memory blocks leads to additional health units. There are a number of bosses (targets on his list) that require more advanced tactics.<br><br>There are some differences between the versions. The larger ones contain up to thirteen missions and also offer horseback sequences, along with graphic depictions of assassinations with comic book-style panels.

Description=Bubble Bash! is a modern take on the Bust-a-Move concept with a tropical setting. The playing field consists of several bubbles of different colours. Usually, the aim of the game is to remove all bubbles by linking three bubbles of the same colour to destroy them. You either only have a limited amount of time, or have to prevent the packs of bubbles from reaching the bottom of the screen. Bubbles are launched by the teamwork of three characters. Crab holds the bubble and the other two, Kale and Malia, place it on a pedestal and swing it into the field with a stick.<br><br>The game improves on the concept with the addition of balloons. Instead of a fixed rectangular playing field, there are different floating sections of bubbles held up by a balloon. Certain game types require you to hit the balloon or you can wait until two sections approach each other to launch a bubble in between and cause a chain reaction. Advanced strategies require you to launch bubbles against the bouncing sides of the field, or you can link bubbles near the top of the pack to drag along the ones underneath with the explosion. There are also birds flying by. These can be hit, but they also return all bubbles shot into the void to randomly insert them in the field. The direction of the bubbles you launch is shown by a small guiding line.<br><br>Next to the regular bubbles, there are (super) bomb bubbles (destroys everything it touches), mine bubbles (explodes when hit by another bubble), chameleon bubbles (takes the same colour as the bubbles it comes in contact with), colour bomb bubbles (when hit, it destroys all bubbles of a specific colour), ice bomb bubbles (freezes every bubble it hits), wave bubbles (destroys all bubbles on the same row), balloon inflate/deflate bubbles (lowers or rises the balloons), hidden bubbles (they only show their colour when hit), gift bubbles (releases a collectible item when destroyed), flower bubbles (creates a flower of bubbles of an identical colour), move bubbles, switch bubbles and solid or semi-solid bubbles that are hard to remove.<br><br>The main aim of the game is to help Kale and Malia discover treasure on Bubble Island. By completing sections of the island, you collect pieces of a map. Each section consists of three progressively unlocked tiers of games. After finishing the first two tiers with five games each, a boss level becomes available. The different variations require you to release balloons as fast as possible, burst all bubbles while the characters' platform rises near the top of the screen, clear a screen of bubbles hidden every few seconds, or shoot passing birds holding balloons. New levels and outfits for the characters are unlocked by completing games and gathering collectible items. There is a tutorial explaining the basics and the Crab Fever mode to keep playing a single game until you are bust. The game's theme song is a digitized version of Nena's 99 Luftballons.

The player's score is converted in cash, which can be exchanged for new signature moves at his sensei's dojo. Chuck cannot die, instead he rewinds time and does it again just because he likes it. He can also pick up almost any object (including cars) to smash opponents and shout "bang" to kill an opponent. Other special moves can only be performed when the fury bar is full. The game is filled with cheesy lines and humour based on the Chuck Norris jokes and there are often small, time-limited challenges where extra cash can be earned.<br><br>The game has a feature where players can use their phone to take a picture of friends and then use them as enemies in the game.

Description=Chuzzle Deluxe is a tile matching puzzle game with 4 different game modes and trophies for special events.<br><br>Basically, you have a 6x6 rows big screen, filled with different colored Chuzzles (some sort of pets). Unlike other tile matching games, you don't move the tile (in this case the Chuzzle), but you actually move the entire row so that you get 3 same colored Chuzzles in a group. They then "explode" and the gap is filled with new Chuzzles. Row moving is possible due to the fact that the rows (both horizontal and vertical) are "round", meaning that moving the outer left Chuzzle one tile to the left will result in appearing of it at the outer right position.<br><br>The four different game modes are: Classic, Speed, Zen and Mind Bender.<br><br>Classic works like explained above, but you will also face mega Chuzzles (2x2 tiles big) which can't move out of the screen and locks, which will lock the two rows where it is located. Locks can be destroyed by making a match (mega Chuzzles by the way too). The game mode is level based. Just score as much points as needed for the level and you proceed with the next one. If you run out of possible matches, you can scramble the screen (basically this equals the lost of a life).<br><br>Speed is like Classic, but you play against the clock. With each match, the counter is set a bit back, but as soon as the counter reaches the top, one Chuzzle will be locked. This goes until no moves are possible. Once you completed the level, the locks are reset.<br><br>Zen is a relaxing mode. No locks and no clock.<br><br>In Mind Bender, you job is to recreate a certain given pattern with your 36 Chuzzles. No clock and no special level order required to play.<br><br>For the first three game modes, if you don't know any further, you can buy a hint (reduction of the score).<br><br>The major feature of the game are the trophies. In the Trophy Room, you see 22 placeholders for trophies, which will be awarded as soon as you met the requirements. Those are for example for seven-step cascades (you make one match, which will trigger six additional matches), beating 10 levels of Classic, making a six tiles long match, or playing a game without using a hint and much much more.

Primary colours can then be mixed to create new ones (e.g. yellow and then red to have orange). Colour is brought back to the buildings by bumping into them. Ink police officers and vans can be attacked in the meantime. When touched by them, the blob turns black and needs to wash it off. Starting small, absorbing colours also make the blob larger, granting access to new areas or preventing from passing through narrow alleys. A bath will reduce the size.<br><br>Each area consists of different blocks where the blob has a limited amount of time to get a set score, based on applying colours to the buildings. Time can be extended by doing missions for characters, such as racing or painting specific landmark buildings. Based on the performance and style (such as colour harmony or time), different stars are awarded and a revolution meter keeps track of the general progress. Extra points are also awarded when the four letters that spell out "BLOB" are found in an area. After reaching the requested score, the level can be exited.<br><br>Next to the Revolution game mode, there is also Free Splash with only points as an objective.

Description=DOOM II RPG is a follow-up in the style of the Wolfenstein RPG, chronologically set before the events in DOOM RPG. Thanks to secret experiments, the various UAC Bases on Mars, the Moon, Earth and wherever else the cooperation has set foot have experienced incidents involving demons. A team of soldiers including a scientist are sent to Tycho Station on the Moon to investigate. But right at the start, the team is separated and the player is left behind alone to find his way through the station and even Hell itself in order to find and destroy the source of all the problems.<br><br>As with its predecessor, DOOM II RPG  is a first-person role-playing game. The shooter's quick action has been traded in for a slowed down turn-based system where emphasis is placed on using the correct weapons or tools at the right time against the appropriate enemies since each action, be it a step forward, firing a weapon or using a health pack, takes one round. At the start of the game, the player has to choose between one of three characters, changing the stats he starts the game with. While Sarge has a high amount of strength, the scientist has a high IQ but is as agile as a bucket, making him less likely to successfully dodge incoming fire.<br><br>During the course of the game the player earns experience points for killing enemies and subsequently levels up, increasing his stats by doing so. In addition, several mini-games are available that further increase specific skills but also give the player other advantages like a lower price at vending machines or access to a security bot that he can send out to scout the area. As well, several kinds of nano-drinks are available, allowing the character to temporarily boost his stats or make himself immune against fire (which is especially useful against the imps in the game).<br><br>Most of the weaponry and enemies in the game are well-known from the previous games of the DOOM series - including the Soul Cube from DOOM 3, which the player will find in Hell near the end of the game. The most important new addition to the arsenal is the Holy Water Pistol which can be refilled at toilets and other sources of water and scare the demons for a few rounds.

Description=DOOM comes to mobile devices as a first-person turn-based role playing game, co-developed by John Carmack. It incorporates many elements of the original game, but was designed with the limitations of the platform in mind. Instead of giving complete freedom, you move in steps and turn by 90 degrees. You can move as fast as you want, but when a monster appears, the game becomes completely turn-based, both for movement and attacks.<br><br>You are a space marine dispatched to a UAC research facility where a distress call was sent out. You start with a limited amount of health, armor and weapons. As you progress and kill monsters, you gain experience and level up to improve health, strength and agility. When engaging in a fight, hits are determined by your statistics, the type of enemy and the weapon you are currently using. Each enemy has a weapon weakness. You can also collect credits to buy upgrades at computer terminals and talk to characters. The story is revealed through conversations with characters and scripted sequences.<br><br>Familiar elements in the ten new levels of the game are the textures, the HUD, explosive barrels, health vials, ammo and armour skulls to collect, green, blue, yellow and red key cards, secret areas, and of course the weapons, armour and enemies. Next to the pistol, shotgun, super shotgun, chaingun, plasma gun, rocket launcher and BFG-9000, there is also an axe to break doors, a fire extinguisher to put our fires and a mystical weapon called Demon Wolf. A dog collar can be used against dog-like creatures. Medikits, a soul sphere and berserker give you the edge in difficult fights.<br><br>Puzzles often involve key cards, computer terminals and conversations with characters. Important clues and passcodes are stored in your notebook and the auto map provides an overview of the large maps. True to the original game, there are secret areas and a full hidden level. Enemies have been divided over 13 different classes such as Zombie, Commando, Imp, Pain Elemental, Revenant, Baron... with two special creatures. There are 41 different enemies in total with familiar villains such as Mancubus, Cyberdemon, Commando, Bull Demon, Imp Lords...<br><br>You can save and load the game at any time. There are sound effects along with the original Doom title music.

Description=Little Shop: World Traveler is the sixth entry in the hidden object series by GameHouse. As the main protagonist, the player has to go on trips around the globe to find and acquire assorted items for several clients. The main interface is very similar to the one in the previous titles: a static scene showing the location is presented with several objects discreetly placed over certain parts of the scenery. The objective is to search and click on all the items listed at the bottom of the screen, with a minimum of ten objects to complete the level, and a maximum of fifteen to receive a gold star.<br><br>Besides the required list entries, each scene has special power-ups that are activated when clicked. Cameras of any type make the screen all bright with their flash lamps, making the list objects stand out from the white background for a few seconds. Thermometers create a layer of icicles or a wall of fire on each visible list entry, becoming hotter or colder when the cursor is near or far from them. ? marks give extra hints, while ! points activate a power-up related to the location. In the forest, this specific power is a compass whose needle spins faster when near one of the list objects. A trophy is received after collecting all suitcases and passport stampers.<br><br>The Shake-It mini-game at the end of each trip is a new addition to the formula, where a box filled with several small items is shown from a top view, and the player has to drag and shake it to uncover some key objects. In some rounds, the goal is to find several instances of the same object. In others, the objective is to find items like dices and cards that add up to a specified sum. All the locations completed in the main mode can be replayed in the Blitz Mode, where the objective is to find all the objects from a scene as fast as possible, to achieve a high score.

Description="Calling Mega Man! Calling Mega Man! Come in please! ...."<br><br>This is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.<br><br>Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.<br><br>How do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, &amp; Hard Man.<br><br>Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.

Description=A spaceship of rock-based aliens called Lumps invades the home bay of bubble-head creatures.<br><br>Scrubbles is a Puzzle Bobble variant with special items and power-ups and humorous characters and dialogue. The game has two game modes:<br><br>Journey - where a plot unfolds and at each level there's an introduction bit by the characters.<br><br>Endless - an arcade mode of increasing difficulty levels.<br><br>The gameplay on both modes follows the standards of the genre: on all levels a cluttered screen must be cleared by shooting heads from a cannon at the bottom, matching three or more heads of the same type to make them disappear. Special items can be collected in the same way:<br><br>- A sureshot ball with a reticule that allows the player to see where the head is going to land on the screen;<br><br>- A hotfoot ball with a fireball that knocks out a row of objects;<br><br>- A plunger ball that equips temporally the cannon with a bathroom plunger that retrieves heads from the screen;<br><br>- A bomb ball that when matched explodes and destroys the surrounding heads.<br><br>- A bubblebubble ball that replaces heads on the screen with one of its own color;<br><br>- A crate with a power-up inside that breaks after being hit a fixed amount of times.<br><br>There are two types of levels: the normal type, where the top of the screen keeps pushing the heads downwards until they touch the bottom, and ball mode, where all the heads form a spherical shape at the center that keeps rotating with every shot.

Description=Slingo Quest is a progression of Slingo games; Slingo is a combination of slot machines and Bingo. The player is presented with a Bingo-style card (usually 5x5 squares) and is given a certain number of spins. Each spin triggers 5 wheels to spin, one corresponding to each column. The player then marks off squares on the card if they contain numbers from the spin. Jokers can also show up during spins which allow the player to mark off any square from the column.<br><br>Players can get extra points for various feats, such as clearing the entire card. Different cards have different Slingo patterns highlighted in red that are worth extra points if the player marks every square. Sometimes, slots can produce devils that take a percentage of the player's accumulated treasure (though the treasure might be safe if the player has demon protection). <br><br>Further, there are bonus rounds to be played against a pirate where a lot of treasure is at stake. The player and the pirate take turns spinning on the same board. Occasionally, a treasure chest pops up which may contain treasure or it may confiscate treasure. The player that discovers the chest has right of first refusal-- they can choose to open it or make the other player open it.<br><br>Other rounds present the player with a 7x7 game board, instead of a 5x5 board. Some rounds have 2, 3, or 4 5x5 boards that are played concurrently.

Description=Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent, Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. <br><br>The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends, and trapped them inside  robots.  Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. <br><br>Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. <br><br>The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. <br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."

This way they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg.  Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from taking over the world. <br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog.  Like the original, players run through different worlds called "Zones", which each have their own specific theme.  There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress.<br><br>Sonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the levels.  As with most platformers, when the player collects 100 rings, they earn an extra life.  However, the rings also act as protection - if Sonic is hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible.  If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life.<br><br>If the player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access the Special Stage.  In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint.  Complete all the checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.<br><br>New to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails.  Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play.  Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a "Spin Dash".  This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where you need some momentum.<br><br>The game also features a 2-player versus mode.  This mode is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones in the single player game.
