Description=3-D Ultra NASCAR Pinball is, as the name suggests, a pinball game with a racing theme. Unique is that the theme is not only present on the table's background images but that the player actually takes the role of one of four real-life NASCAR drivers. Every race consists of three parts, each represented by one table: preparing, racing and pit stops.<br><br>The player prepares his car by playing at the garage table. Similar to regular pinball games the goal is to score as most points as possible. The player visits the speedway table two times per race: at first there is a qualifying round which, together with the garage score, sets the starting position for the race. During the race the player constantly competes against the other drivers; to be successful he needs to score points by hitting certain parts of the table as fast as possible. Lastly the pit stop table is entered by hitting a certain point on the speedway table. This is required if the player hits the &quot;accident&quot; spot or at certain times during the race. Again the goal is to hit certain points on the table as fast as possible.<br><br>The game also includes an informational part on the CD-ROM where the player can read texts or watch videos about NASCAR racing.

They have no means of defense (death is their desire!) and the player tries to rack up combos for more points (from the 2-hit no-armed bandit to the 5-hit bloody zit). Death can also jump, duck, speed up and slow down. At the end of the game, the total score is shown.<br><br>There are a few extras and secrets in the game. First of all, the downhill path is not entirely linear. There are many shortcuts and bridges activated through switches. Regular switches are yellow, but a hidden blue, green and red switch lead to secret locations. These usually include rare emos such as Chris Cocker. He has his own bonus known as the Chris Cocker Rocker.

Description=Willy Beamish is a kid who likes to goof off and have fun. Naturally all the grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room, etc. But now that's school's out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.<br><br>The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded. <br><br>The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy's relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.

Description=Air Pressure is a short visual novel that tells a story through text and pictures, with a few moments where the player can steer the conversation to alter the outcome. It is told from the perspective of a man and most of the game deals with the relationship with his girlfriend Leigh. They met as teenagers but after several years the man is no longer sure how he feels about having her around anymore. He needs to make a decision about how he sees his future life. Based on the player's decisions three different outcomes can eventually be reached.<br><br>Although the game appears to lean towards the romances and dating simulation mechanics the visual novel genre is especially known for, gradually and especially after multiple playthroughs the player is given cues in the text and images by which the whole story can be interpreted as a metaphor for something wholly different. Through this, the initially straightforward story is given a whole level of depth, with plenty of room for interpretation.

Description=This game presents a dark re-interpretation of the fairy tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (here called dwarrows), where the evil queen with the magic mirror is most likely a demon-possessed witch, her pale step(?)daughter likely also a witch or perhaps even a vampire, and even the loyal woodsman charged with executing her in the woods may be more than he seems.  It is this last character controlled by the player, primarily navigating to one of the game's 18 different endings by traversing through a path of some of the game's 415 conversation fragments with Snow White as she awaits her fate at the player's hands.<br><br>As with Short's earlier magnum opus Galatea, the most significant gameplay elements here are conversational in nature, the outcome of dialogue exchanges changing the moods of the characters and revealing new knowledge that informs the possible navigation and (minimal) inventory-manipulation options at the player's disposal. Extraordinary verbs furthering this unusual gameplay include TOPICS, which proposes conversational threads to pursue, and THINK, which tabulates the sum of the knowledge thus far achieved through the conversations completed.  Upon game completion, the player can also invoke the ENDINGS command to reveal which game conclusions have thus far been achieved -- some of which require more knowledge (derived from more conversation) than others.<br><br>A further feature of the game is its dynamic illustration engine, collaging picture elements automatically depending on the characters' moods.

Description=The object of this puzzle game is to turn all squares on the board from lead to gold. You do this by placing rune symbols on squares of the board but they must go next to an already occupied space. They must also either be of the same shape or colour of any other symbols to the right/left and top/bottom of it.  A grey stone acts as a wild card and can be placed anywhere and any symbol can be placed next to it. A skull has to be placed on an occupied square and will destroy anything on it.<br><br> <br>If one whole row or column of symbols is filled, all symbols on it will disappear.  If there is nowhere to place a symbol, you can discard it into a forge.  The molten level in the forge will rise with every discarded rune but will lower if another is placed on the board. However, if 4 consecutive are discarded then the game is over.   There are three levels of difficulty, each with more different types and colors of runes.

To see in the darkness the marine uses a shoulder-mounted flashlight or night vision, both of which drain battery power (which recharges on its own after a time).

The alien has various stages of its life cycle, all of which tend to leave it with no weapons beyond its own claws and teeth, although some alien forms also feature a tail which can temporarily stun enemies.

You can pick deadly Aliens, that has very piercing claws and striking tail, beside the double mouths that can pierce the enemy skull. You can also be a Predator, also an alien race that came here to hunt, and by that he uses chameleon transparent cover, many vision modes, easy to locate anything that breaths or moves, with one gun mounted on his shoulder, and add-on knife-alike pack on his arm fist. He also uses other weapons, and can easily zoom any enemy even to 8x. Last race is Humans, to be specific, a Marine. Without weapons he's fairly weak, but that's why his weapon arsenal is huge, flamethrowers, miniguns, machineguns, bazookas, etc. and beside that he can watch in night-vision mode, or use his flares to enter the dark. However, flares are limited to five at the time. So pick a race and demonstrate your abilities, either as a human, alien or predator.<br><br>This Gold Edition gives you more than 30 levels, including 5 bonus levels for each race. There are 16 multiplayer maps in this version, Millennium Add-on Pack, and Aliens Versus Predator: Prima's Official Strategy Guide.

Description=Alley 19 Bowling is a happy-go-lucky bowling simulation which features an atmosphere of 1950s America. The theme, music, sound effects and graphics take you back to the time when jukeboxes played your favorite rock and roll tunes and the jitterbug was the hottest dance craze.<br><br>The game starts in the Pro Shop, where you enter the names of yourself and the 3 other bowlers playing against you. Choose whether they are human or computer players, right- or left-handed, and which ball they'll use. You set your preferences here too - the music and sound volumes, whether to turn the "ball guide" on or off, and whether to use the normal or "Rock-n-Bowl" background. When done, click "Bowl" to begin playing.<br><br>Like in real bowling, the object is to knock down all 10 pins in as few turns as possible. All action is handled with your mouse and takes some practice to master.<br><br>To begin, move the mouse to the right until you pick up your ball. Then move left until you are positioned in the lane. Left-click and hold the mouse button down and move left or right to position the shot. Then move it forward and let go when you want to release the ball. The faster your forward stroke, the quicker the ball will roll. (If you have the "ball guide" option "on", you'll visually see an illustration of ball's path before you throw it.) You are able to hook your shot by moving the mouse just before letting go.<br><br>The game keeps track of the number of games you have bowled, your high score, average score, and highest three-game series.<br><br>Although advertised, multiplayer support over a LAN or the Internet was only playable in the Macintosh version when the game first shipped. A patch must be obtained (v1.7) to enable multiplayer in Windows.

Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons. <br><br>Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.

Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.<br><br>Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).<br><br>Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. <br><br>Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery. <br><br>Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.

Her latest project is a spagetti western being filmed in an abandoned western ghost town called Slaughter Gultch, which rests precariously on the edge of the San Andreas fault. Originally a gold town set up rather rudely on ancient Indian sacred ground, Slaughter Gultch was founded by a man named Jebediah Stone and run by his own private army of cold-blooded killers. Stone and his men were killed by angry villagers led by the local Blacksmith, and the town was abandoned soon after. Unfortunately, Emily's crew disturbs the spirits of Stone and his men, who promptly return to the world of the living and proceed to kill off the film crew one by one. <br><br>Carnby is called to Slaughter Gultch after learning of the disappearance of Emily and her crew, and is soon met by Stone's Zombie Cowboy gang. Armed with various western paraphenalia such as colt peacemakers, bullwhips, and even a gattling gun, Carnby must fight his way through Stone's minions and discover Emily's fate. Along the way he learns some surprising things about Stone's origin, as well as a sinister plan interrupted by his death which involved the destruction of the west coast and which Stone can now pursue once again.

Description=AlphaNatix: Urban Legends Edition is a word-construction game with arcade elements, where the main objective is to spell nine words associated with a famous urban myth on each level, within a time limit. The player controls a sphere rolling on a isometric, tilted plane where several letter tiles are arranged on mixed groups. Tiles touched by the ball are spelled on a tray at the top, where the words have to be completed by passing over all the required letters in the correct order. The tile formations are floating on space, and the orb can fall over the edge and disappear. Levels have a variable number of spare spheres available.<br><br>Some stages have special tiles and bonus items. Tiles with arrows throw the ball towards the direction they are pointing, sometimes helping to skip tiles and spell a word, while in certain situations acting as traps and pushing the orb into space. Pairs of colored tiles teleport the sphere to other parts of the field. The bonus items can be found as spinning cubes scattered around the level, adding extra spheres, more time and multiplying points when collected. The introduction screens for each level have a clue at the bottom for a secret bonus word.

Her friend, Joe, presumes that something might has happened to her and asks you, the player, to investigate.<br><br>In order to help Roxy and the spirits of the house, you will have to use the AMBER device, that will provide you with the ability to experience ghost's stories in form of the lucid dreams. Each dream will be presented in the unique stylistic presentation. For example a sequence involving the death of the girl living in 1940s will be presented in B&W with lots of period music in the background. Once you've investigated the cause and the circumstances of each spirit's torments you finally  will be able to help Roxy herself. <br><br>Although, the game does require player to solve as inventory-based puzzles so as the Myst-like mechanical and mathematical puzzles, the emphasis is more on the exploration and presentation of the story. For instance, all "ghost" parts of the game have neither inventory nor items to collect.  So the key element of the gameplay is exploring environments in order to advance the plot by revealing crucial information as to to the reasons of ghost's bond to the world of the living.

Description=In Amnesia: The Dark Descent you play as a nameless man trapped in the mansion of a Prussian Baron named Alexander.  The only clues to your identity are mementos and notes left behind by a man named Daniel, who commands you to find and kill Alexander.  The gameplay has you searching for Daniel's diaries and other notes and journals of the poor souls who have crossed Baron Alexander.  You must solve the mystery of the mansion while running from a Shadow that is constantly chasing you throughout.<br><br>The game takes place from a first person perspective however there are no weapons.  You can not fight monsters and your only choice is to run or hide. Along with self-preservation, the player must keep themselves sane.  In order to stay sane they must keep moving and pushing the plot forward, as well as making sure they always have light.  The player must scour every corner for oil and tinderboxes.  Oil will allow the player to use a lamp to provide them with light and tinderboxes can be used to light candles and torches strewn throughout the mansion.  If you are still in the dark for too long you will gradually lose your sanity.  As you lose sanity, the world will distort and become hard to navigate and will gradually fall apart and the Shadow will find you.  The player must evade the shadow entirely, but this will affect their sanity as to hide from the shadow they must hide in the dark.  You must also never look at the Shadow because if you stare at it too long your sanity will be fully compromised and the shadow will find you and take a deadly physical form.<br><br>The player must solve various puzzles and the game is very much a fully interactive adventure game.  Players interact with the environment using a physics based method where their mouse is emulated as a hand, meaning they will need to rotate it to turn wheels or use it to "Grab" drawers and pull them open by moving the mouse.  Players can also pick up objects and throw them to distract the shadow or solve certain physical puzzles.

Description=Ancient Art of War is a real-time strategy game based on the very basic elements of war: unit types, formation, and strength. The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast "Barbarians", the heavily armored but slow "Knights", and the ranged "Archers". A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: "Spies", which is only available under certain campaign rule settings.  <br><br>The game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.<br><br>Gameplay is represented in two major areas:<br><br>1. The first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier;<br><br>The second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).<br><br>The difficulty setting is based on real-historical characters, (with the exception of possibly) Crazy Ivan as the easiest and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.<br><br>Construction Set<br>The game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor.

Description=And Yet It Moves is a platform game with puzzle elements where the goal is simply to complete each of the levels. The twist is that next to regular movement (left, right, jumping), the player is also able to rotate the game world in instances of ninety degrees, both left and right. That way, the environment can be explored in different directions. Even though it becomes possible to complete a level without the movement keys, it is mainly used for puzzles. Players need to take out enemies by moving items from the environment, guide a shadow character that mirror the player's actions, or do complex sets of platform jumping including bouncing ledges and swings. By quickly rotating, the velocity can be increased to dazzling speeds, but when the character hits the ground too fast or from too high a distance, he will be killed.<br><br>After every section there is a checkpoint and there is an unlimited amount of tries per level. The graphical style is envisioned as a world of paper cut-outs, in regard to the player's character as well as every item in the environment. There are also different themes for the levels, including fire, jungle and rocks. The game is divided into three main acts and an epilogue. Next to the main game mode, the levels can be played in competition for the fastest times, with global high score leaderboards as well as ghosts of other players.

Assil, a young Egyptian architect's son, steals the key of the great pyramid in Cairo to throw a party, but once inside he accidentally knocks over some ancient urns. Struck by a death curse of a disturbed mummy, he has very little time left. At the same time, however, he receives the magical ankh, and he may be about to meet the woman of his dreams. The pharaoh is the only one who can help you, but you are just a pleb, so you need to travel through the Egyptian locale and find a way to attract his attention.<br><br>The game uses a 3D engine with a fixed camera and everything is controlled by the mouse. Upon hovering over items, the appropriate action appears: walking, running, looking, picking up, talking or using. Items are gathered in the inventory at the top of the screen. You can examine them, use them in the environment, or combine to create a new item. At certain moments, you control multiple characters and need to exchange items to solve the puzzles. The tab button brings up a list of all open quests.<br><br>Although there is no time dependency, the curse's effects become visible when the magic takes over control of Assil's body, and mystical tattoos appear progressively. The graphics and humour are reminiscent of the LucasArts adventures, and Telltale Games, with many ex-LucasArts employees aboard, took on an advisory role for the project.

And all it took was giving the heart of Osiris back to him at the end of Ankh: Heart of Osiris. He didn't listen to Osiris or even ask questions about the Ankh or the strange "Battle of the Gods" he needed his heart for. He just went on with his life and built a house together with Thara.<br><br>Had he listened, he would have been prepared for tonight because another thousand years are up and the sign of the camel once again shines bright from the sky. It is the sign for the Gods that they once again need to engage in a tournament whose winner will rule over Egypt the centuries to come. But Assil just didn't listen. Instead the Ankh wakes him up when the Ancient God embedded in it begins to speak. He tells Assil that he needs to stop the God Seth from winning the tournament and since he is the keeper of the Ankh he has to do as told. So it is up to Assil to save Egypt.<br><br>You take control of Assil with your mouse and guide him through the different environments talking to people through multiple choice dialogues, while you pick up items which are needed to solve the many puzzles on the journey. On the way he will not only revisit familiar locations (like Cairo) and meet old friends, but he will also visit new locations including the famous Casino of Luxor and meet new characters everywhere.<br><br>During the course of the game you will also have the chance to take control of Thara to solve riddles where more than one person is needed or which Assil cannot solve since he is for example afraid of water since that incident in Ankh. To help you on your adventure, the game now features a hotspot indicator. If you press the corresponding button, the game shows you all the things in the current room you can interact with.<br><br>The game is not considered a sequel, but rather a stand-alone add-on or additional episode.

Description=Another Day at Work: Wednesday is an open ended sequel to Epic Banana's previously released A Day at Work. Players once again take the role of Tom, an employee at Office Inc., and guide him through a typical day in his small, self-contained town. Whether Tom chooses to live the life of a law-abiding, office going citizen or an unruly, nihilistic member of society is entirely in the hands of the player. Due to the nature of the game there are no goals to accomplish, nor can the player win or lose, and thus the game does not end unless Tom is killed.<br><br>Gameplay is largely grounded in exploration of the city, which is broken up into numerous individual fixed screens, and interactions with the environment and objects therein. Unlike the majority of open world titles, Wednesday strongly emphasizes the copiousness of interactions over any sizable physical scale. As such, while there are only sixteen buildings and three main streets in the game's city, there tends to be a high concentration of interactive objects and multiple solutions to scenarios and problems the player might come across. Because of this approach, many of the actions that the player takes in one area will effect the possibilities available in other sections of the city. For example, calling your work with a bomb threat will result in its temporary closure, limiting the player's possible sources of income.<br><br>At the top of the screen is a status bar which provides an overview of Tom's present condition. This provides the player with information about how healthy he is, how much money he's carrying, how hungry he might be, the time of day, and the contents of his inventory. At any given time he can carry only one object and one weapon in his inventory, although the items he might have are almost always temporary or of a single use. If the player fails to keep Tom fed he'll begin randomly collapsing, which reduces his health. If his health runs out, Tom dies.

And Aquatic's only hope for survival are you.<br><br>Once you started a level, you see multiple rows of bubbles with different colors. All of them are moving down in real-time. So you don't have much time to think. Now you control a colored gun, which also fires bubbles (the bubble has the color, which the gun currently has). Your mission is to combine at least 3 bubbles of the same color; if this happens, they will explode. But you can blow up 20 and more bubbles at once, just fire at the bunch of them. If there are any bubbles beneath the one that explode, and if there is no further connection, these bubbles will fall down, making more space (and providing bonus points). <br><br>If you are too slow, and the bubbles touching the water at the bottom of the screen, you loose. But if you are fast enough, and scoring a certain amount of points (you can see how good you are on your water-meter), you proceed to the next level.<br><br>The more levels you play, the more different colors you face. And, of course, the faster the bubbles will come down.<br><br>To make the game more fun, the game offers 8 different power ups. But you can't find them, you will shoot them, like normal bubbles. And when you blow them up (by combining them with other bubbles of the same color), the power up gets activated.<br><br>The game offers the following power ups: Dual Color (acting as two different colored bubbles in one; i.e. firing blue/red bubble will react with blue and red bubbles), Double Bonus / Triple Bonus (multiplying your score for bubbles you blow up), Layer Up (give you more air to breath by moving the bubbles some rows up), Prompt (will show you the exact destination where your fired bubble will attach), Freeze (will freeze the entire playfield for some seconds; you can blow up bubbles, but they do not move), Bomb (will blow up all adjacent bubbles, even if they are the wrong color), and Repaint (will color black bubbles with colors from the current level).

But the game principal is still the same...<br><br>Shooting an aqua bubble with the gun at the bubbles in the level, combining at least three of a kind to remove them. Do this to preventing that the bubbles reach the water at the bottom, if that happen, it's game over.<br><br>The four different game modes are: Arcade, Panic, Puzzle, and Recolor.<br>Two of the game modes are real-time, the other are turn-based.<br><br>Arcade is the same game mode as the whole predecessor. You have a point limit you must reach, before the level completes. If you wait, the bubbles will move down in real-time, so if you wait to long, you loose. You can see at your water meter how long it will take before the level ends.<br><br>Panic is the same as Arcade, except that this is a turn based game mode. That means, the bubbles won't move down when you do nothing. After firing a bubble, your Water Meter will climb, when it reaches the top, the whole ceiling will move down a bit, moving all attached bubbles down. After that, you can again fire a certain amount of bubbles, before the ceiling moves again a bit down. But why is this called Panic? That is because, when you don't fire yourself, the computer will auto-fire for you. And the computer's motive is not to win the game, it's a random aimed fire. Aquatic will warn you, if you running out of time.<br><br>Puzzle is like Panic, except that the gun won't auto-fire. Furthermore, the level is not randomly filled with bubbles. Instead, each level looking always the same (every level x when restarted, of course, not all levels in this game mode).<br><br>Recolor operates like Arcade, but with the exception, that all adjacent bubbles of a newly attached bubble will take the color of that new attached bubble. So, either you remove at least three bubbles with a shot, or you will change the color of existing bubbles. This can be used as an advantage, to remove big amounts of bubbles at once. But if you have 8 different colors in the game, it can really be a pain.<br><br>Like the predecessor, the game offers Power-Ups, which can be used in all game modes, except Puzzle. Furthermore, the Dual Color is not available in Recolor mode. The Power-Ups are identical to the ones in the predecessor.<br><br>These are: Dual Color (acting as two different colored bubbles in one; i.e. firing blue/red bubble will react with blue and red bubbles, and if you shoot good, with both), Double Bonus / Triple Bonus (multiplying your score for bubbles you blow up), Layer Up (give you more air to breath by moving the bubbles some rows up), Prompt (will show a trajectory line with the exact destination where your fired bubble will attach), Freeze (will freeze the entire playfield for some seconds; you can blow up bubbles, but they do not move), Bomb (will blow up a number of bubbles at the point of impact), and Repaint (will color black bubbles with colors from the current level).<br><br>The more levels you complete, the more Power-Ups will be available, but also the more colors are available (max eight). And furthermore, the faster the game will be (or the less bubbles in turn mode for a turn).

One day the city is hit by meteors and she tumbles down into the endless depths of the object of her fantasy: the ocean. Instead of drowning she wakes up, transformed to fit her new environment: a cave that serves as her sanctuary for a long time.

But eventually she leaves the cave, driven out by loneliness (inspired by Metroid) and restlessness, wondering if she is the only one of her kind.<br><br>Aquaria is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with a focus on exploration. Naija can freely roam her underwater world with fluent movement, reminiscent of Ecco the Dolphin. She soon meets a dark creature that shows the hidden dangers Naija will have to face if she continues her quest. Naija is moved around large maps at a constant speed. Clicking away gives her a speed boost and she can also cling to walls to launch herself with a sudden burst, or break through the ocean surface.<br><br>To face dangers, Naija has to use the power of the verse. By right-clicking on her, eight notes of different colours are shown, and clicking them triggers a chant. By chanting the right tone at certain plants, Naija can collect items, and learn spells and recipes. In the style of Loom or The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the notes can be combined into songs to cast spells. These form shields, can be used to lift objects or change Naija to different forms with new abilities giving access new locations. Right-clicking interacts with the environment and is used for attacking. In an items menu food and other objects can be used or cooked in combination to form new ones. During the game Naija also meets four pets that assist her and there are ancient turtles she can use to travel over large distances.<br><br>The different environments are linked from Naija's home, a central hub. Hidden treasures found while exploring are used to decorated the cave or can be used as a costume. During gameplay, a mini-map is shown in the bottom right corner and it can be enlarged to a full map. The game can be saved using red crystals scattered around the areas and it includes a level editor to create new environments and modifications.

Description=Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. <br><br>However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star Control, also by Paul Reiche III). If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.<br><br>Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.<br><br>The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.<br><br>Archon can be played with either one or two players.<br>The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.

Description=Arthur's Pet Chase is a cartoon-style side-scrolling platform game starring characters from a popular children's book series by author Marc Brown, also made into a PBS television series. Arthur is a young aardvark entrepreneur - he has started up a pet-sitting business in his home, and as the game opens, he signs in his 30th customer. All seems to be going well, although his mother and sister DW plant doubts about his ability to care for so many animals. As Arthur goes to sleep, he falls into a nightmarish dream - all of the animals have gotten loose and are running around the city, and Arthur has to chase them down one by one. <br><br>The player guides Arthur through 30 levels in 5 different areas: <br><br>1. Arthur's Neighborhood<br>2. DW's Room<br>3. The Sugar Bowl<br>4. The Library<br>5. The Haunted House<br><br>There are different monsters and different power-ups in each area - the weapon of choice is a water balloon, which stuns opponents long enough to get past them. The player begins the game with water balloons as well as X-Ray Vision Eyeglasses, which make the pet's paw prints visible. As he progresses through the levels, the player can pick up the Bionic Bunny Super-Strength Cape, allowing him to move large objects out of his path, and DW's Safety Scissors, for cutting ropes that block his way. Arthur can climb, run, crouch, and jump over spaces and objects using the keyboard controls, collecting power bars and moon boots and avoiding gum, which slows him down. Milk cartons denote checkpoints, which Arthur is returned to if he falls or runs into an <br>enemy. Enemies vary from flying books and witches to evil troll dolls and malignant hamburgers.<br><br>Pressing P (for Pause) brings up the level selection screen, where the player can view how many power bars were collected and whether or not a pet was found on a level, and elect to return to any level already played.

Description=Arthur is an 8 year old aardvark created by children's book author and illustrator Marc Brown. In Arthur's Sand Castle Contest, he enters a castle-building contest while visiting the beach with family and friends - the goal in this game is to complete a castle using pre-made blueprints or your own imagination. This requires a certain amount of planning, as you have to collect the ingredients to make bricks: sand and water.<br><br>To collect sand, you control Arthur with the mouse in an arcade-style game. As his dog Pal digs up clumps of sand, you move Arthur and his bucket across the screen with the mouse, catching the flying sand. Sometimes, Pal will dig up crabs that inflict a painful nip and cause Arthur to lose his sand, and sometimes he'll find special items that Arthur needs to make bricks. Pushing the spacebar causes Arthur to jump over crabs on the ground. When the bucket is full you have the option of filling another. Depending on the level, each bucket of sand can be worth 3 or more bricks.<br><br>To collect water you move Arthur across the hot sand through a maze of beach towels until he reaches the water's edge and can fill his bucket. There are dogs, crabs, and large bathers to avoid, puddles of water to soothe hot feet, and french fries to renew Arthur's energy. Success at collecting enables cut-scenes in which Arthur's friends bring him pretty rocks and shells they've found, to use as decorations.<br><br>Arthur's friend Brain has stumbled upon an old junked Sno-Cone machine, which he has managed to convert into a sand castle brick-making machine. If you bring him the sand and water to feed into it, his machine will mold it into bricks for you. Moreover, if you collect particular items that Brain asks for he will exchange them for specialty bricks. Finding an old shoe, for example, may allow you to make a crown-like brick; finding a milk carton may open up a pyramid-shaped brick, etc.<br><br>At the sand tray, drag and drop bricks from Arthur's wagon onto the grid in free building or follow the blueprint you've chosen, poke window holes, add decorations and flags and pour water for a moat. When you are done, use the whistle to call over the contest judge, and if your castle passes muster you'll make it into the local paper! <br><br>Arthur's Sand Castle Contest is intended for children aged 4 - 7 and exercises learning skills; critical thinking, creativity and problem solving.

Description=A Tale in the Desert is an massively multiplayer online roleplaying game with an ancient Egyptian setting. It has two main differences to other games in this genre: Firstly it abandoned fighting completely. The main focus of the game lies in the community and the mutual forming of a society. Secondly it has a limited run time, every few years a new "tale" starts which resets the game and brings new features.<br><br>Since grinding monsters is out of the question, the main occupation is crafting and the completion of several tests which are divided into seven categories: Architecture, Art, Body, Conflict (later replaced with Harmony), Leadership, Thought and Worship. The tests itself are varied, e.g. logic puzzles for Thought, finding a certain number of mushrooms for Body or building houses for Architecture. Every category starts with an easy quest as tutorial and ends with special challenges where many players have to work together.<br><br>Another important part of the game is research and development which are conducted in schools and universities. Like the tests these improvements are divided into the seven categories, e.g. Chemistry in Thought or mining in Architecture. Like in reality before an invention is made "public" the development costs time and resources in it. Later everyone can learn the techniques in schools. Other things have to be developed/learned by the players themselves, e.g. the optimal production of certain goods. <br><br>Another special feature of the game is the legal system which is basically done by the players themselves. The process is basically that one player starts a petition and gathers signatures. If he got enough there is a voting. When the proposal passes this step the game gets reprogrammed to enforce the law.

Description=Atlantis Sky Patrol is a marble shooter game with steampunk and Art Deco themes. A twisting track occupies most of the screen state, with lines of multi-colored spheres entering it from one end and rolling towards the exit. The objective is to clear the field by making matches of three or more balls of the same color. The player controls a ship that moves sideways at the bottom, aiming and shooting the matching spheres towards the moving strings. Each level has a series of static balls outside the tracks, that have to be matched and destroyed to stop new marble lines from entering the field. If three or more spheres enter the exit, the game is over and the level has to be restarted.<br><br>Matches of long chains cause explosions that shower down various power-ups and coins, where the ship must be moved quickly to pick up all the falling items before they disappear at the bottom. The power-ups are used automatically after being collected. The Power Ball acts as a wildcard, matching spheres of any color. The Rainbow Hammer throws several balls at the same time. The Rewind moves the lines back to the start. The Color Scanner removes all the spheres of one specific color. The Soul of Atlantis shoots a vertical beam, destroying several marbles in its path. The Orichalchum Bomb explodes the balls surrounding its landing spot.<br><br>The coins are used on separate shop screen between levels, to buy helpful upgrades. The accuracy upgrade adds an aiming laser to the ship. Speed upgrades make the ship shoot faster. The bonus magnet attracts all the falling items, making it easier to catch all of them. Rewinder upgrades increase the number of bonus items at the end of each level. The disrupter delays the release of new marble strings. Every upgrade has several levels, each gradually more expensive and stronger.<br><br>A mini-game appears between levels, where the goal is to shoot the large, floating spheres bouncing around to collect bonus items, avoiding hits to the mines that explode the marbles. Besides the main single player campaign, there are modes for two players on the same machine. Team Quest mode is similar to the main single-player Quest mode, but with both players cooperating to beat each level. Competition mode has the players fighting each other.

The game has full voice acting for all the characters, and Flo can talk to other people to receive clues and hints about the tasks that need to be accomplished to save the wedding.<br><br>The interface at the bottom shows the inventory with the collected objects, from where all the items can be dragged and dropped on logical places to perform actions and solve puzzles. Three icons at the bottom-right give access to helpful information. The map shows all the places visited, items collected, tasks completed and characters met so far. The napkin has a task list showing all the pending wedding problems to be solved, being automatically filled with new information as the player advances in the game. The plastic bag holds all the butterflies found and collected around the town.<br><br>Some locations have special puzzles and mini-games that take place on a separate screen, where the player has to manipulate a mechanism of some sort to solve them. The challenges are related to the locations and the plot. In the clothes shop, a sequence of beads have to be sewed on a dress in a unbroken line, following and filling a pattern contour. In the pet shop, bags of animal food and other store items have to be placed inside the limited space of a cardboard box. In the fitness center, there's a rhythm mini-game where the goal is to hit the correct exercise moves on a wheel at the right time, when the corresponding icon is passing over a button at the top.<br><br>Plastic bottles, cans and butterflies can be found and collected on most street scenes. The bottles and cans have to be used on the recycling machines to receive subway tokens, while 33 butterflies have to be collected to gain access to new neighborhoods. Flo can travel between neighborhoods by taking the subway train.

Description=Avernum is a remake of Exile, Spiderweb Software's first game. It uses the Nethergate game engine and plays in much the same way. A few things have been improved, however. Instead of just clicking on subjects players want to know more about in conversations, and getting static data as feedback, they can now select from several choices of what to say. It is a more natural system, like in Ultima Underworld. The combat has not changed significantly, except that there are new weapons, and many more spells, than in previous games, and these have altered graphics. The sprite animation has been expanded on, and additional frames added to the character animations. The isometric tile-by-tile scrolling view has not changed, but the many frames added on will help improve combat.

Your duty is to make sure that you help the ancient Vahnatai and secure a peace between your two peoples. Your people, the Exiles, need their help to defeat the invading Empire forces.

Description=Avernum 4 has you in charge of a 4-character party, whose task is to discover why your homeland of Avernum has been undergoing a series of unnatural disasters. The game uses a modified version of the Geneforge engine, meaning that its interface is entirely different from the previous Avernum games. Although the character pictures are the same (the ones that are displayed in the inventory screen), the graphics used for the characters in the game are different. This also applies to the graphics used for the enemies as well. The game is played using the mouse and keyboard, with the former serving as the main means of control, and the latter providing shortcut keys. Thus movement, object interaction, combat, and dialogue is controlled via the mouse, although the game can be configured so that the keyboard can be used for movement as well. <br>Combat is a standard, turn-based affair. Each character has a finite number of action points that are spent either in melee/ranged attacks, movement, or spell casting.

Description=Balance of the Planet is an environmental management simulation.<br><br>It is the successor to Balance of Power.<br><br>Chris Crawford seems to have a special liking for problems of global concern. Balance of Power dealt with politics in the cold war, its successor Balance of the Planet simulates nothing less than Earth's ecosystem. Although Maxis' Sim Earth is often credited as the first "ecosim", the title rightfully belongs to Crawford's game. Both games are equally interesting nevertheless, as they use two vastly different approaches to an enormously complex subject.<br><br>Sim Earth tries to simulate the natural processes, i.e. continental drift, weather, global temperature etc. as accurately as possible, and calculates the global impact from this basic conditions. Balance of the Planet breaks down the ecological system into 150 single factors, connected in a cause-and-effect network. Rather than experiencing the ecosystem as a whole, you discover a string of subjects that influence each other. For example, when dealing with global warming, you'd be referred to carbon dioxides and methane (the causes) and rising sea level (the result). By following and understanding the links, you may thus find out in which way beef production influences inundation. There is, however, no accurate simulation of a global ecology, rather than a sophisticated schematic of factors and problems.<br><br>Contrary to Sim Earth, you do not change the mechanisms of nature themselves. Instead, you're to try to influence society by funding and granting subsidies. If you raise the tax on coal considerably, coal burning and thus carbon dioxide output will be discouraged, but the strain on other forms of energy will increase. You'd be best advised to subsidise renewable energies -- which leaves less money for other pressing problems. Your job is to balance the ecology with the age-old system of reward and punishment. This has to be done in only nine turns; you are awarded or subtracted points, depending on your success.<br><br>Balance of the Planet is highly customisable. You may not only load "biased" games, in which you play with a certain prejudice (e.g. pro-nuclear), but also change all the formulas used for calculations to your liking.

Only Imoen, another orphan child who was brought up by Gorion and whom you treat as a sister, is willing to be by your side. You have nothing, no place to call your home, just your companion and the wide world in front of you. And thus your journey begins...<br><br>Baldur's Gate is a role-playing game that uses the rule set of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D). You create your hero by choosing one of the available classes (fighter, thief, mage, priest, ranger, and druid, including sub-classes, dual- and multi-class characters), his (or her) alignment, weapon proficiency etc. For the combat system, a special engine called Infinity Engine is used: the battles are turn-based, but are so fast-paced that the player has an illusion of fighting in real time. You can pause the battle at any time and assign commands (such a spells) to your party members. You can also freely move them around during battles.

A wicked fairy, feeling slighted because she wasn't invited, crashes the birthday party and places a curse on the child-- if she pricks her finger on a sewing spindle during her first 15 years, she will fall into a deep slumber for 100 years. Another fairy is able to mitigate this curse with the stipulation that a prince's kiss will wake her in such an eventuality.<br><br>The game consists of a series of activities that can either be played at random or in order according to the main storyline. Princess Rose wakes up her woodland friends and invites them to her 16th birthday party, makes a dress and crown, plays hide and seek with the fairies, but then gets tricked by the evil fairy into pricking her finger on a sewing spindle and taking a long nap. At that point, the fairies have to put everyone in the castle to sleep while they work on the problem. Then they recruit a prince who must chop through a maze of thorn brush in order to reach the castle and give the princess a smooch. Princess Rose must then battle the wicked fairy in order to retrieve the magic flute.

Now it's 2142 and the war for the few resources left has already been going on for a few years, with no end in sight.<br><br>Besides the now futuristic setting, the main changes to Battlefield 2 are the new Titan Mode and the revised character and stats system.<br><br>In the Titan Mode your goal is to bring down the enemy Titan, a giant ship flying high above the battlefield. At the beginning of the round, the ship is protected by a shield which the enemy team needs to take out. To do so, they can either fire everything they got on it or simply gain control over the missile silos scattered over the map. Once a missile silo has been acquired, it continuously fires missiles at the enemy Titan. Once the shield is down, the players have to destroy three stations inside the ship so that they can gain access to the central core and destroy it.<br><br>The armory and vehicles are similar to Battlefield 2, but they look more futuristic. There are a few additions and changes. The number of character classes has been reduced to 4, but you can customize them with many items and weapons unlock-able during the course of the game. This way, you can provide your scout some C4 (which is now called RDX) and turn him to an special ops. The assault, on the other hand, can be equipped with a defibrillator.<br><br>The whole stats system has been reworked too. There is now much more to gain and the advancements happen more quickly. You can retrieve the dog tag of killed enemies with a knife and look at your collection on the stats page.

We'll just shunt the late bloomers off to the side for a moment and the male avatars for that matter... meanwhile, it is calculated that 50% of the adventurous female avatars didn't employ effective contraception, and are now pregnant.  They get a further prompt: keep the baby or abort it?  Not a choice many are expecting to have to make in a game, and not in front of an audience of two hundred.<br><br>Other lifestyle choices made throughout the avatars' lives (about two hours) influence their careers (four to choose from, same as the speakers on stage) and, relatedly, their financial assets, as well as their appearance (parent avatars have mini blobbies orbiting around them; ex-cons grow devil horns; homeowners are graced with a roof appearing over their head.  And so forth.)  Some of them go abroad, are jailed (by the laws decided by their peers) or hospitalised and are temporarily taken out of play.  Meanwhile the players grow familiar with the four buttons on the joystick in addition to navigation of the 2D plane; jump, drop (return to one's initial position on the screen), bond (find a romantic partner in the vicinity) and split (shed a romantic partner... and lose 1 Besto, the local unit of currency.)<br><br>In adulthood the option presents itself for avatars to stand for public office; mounting the pedestal, their indicting record of choices (or worse, their failure to vote) is plainly presented for all to see -- a player's history on subjects of compassion, justice, patriotism, drug criminalization, immigration, gun ownership -- and terrifyingly the microcosm gets to vote arena-style, blobs mobbing the pedestal most appealing to the most players.  The President gets to make a few choices on everyone's behalf (including the choice to suspend future elections -- tempered by a group poll on whether to mount a coup d'etat) but mostly they just meekly back down on unpopular matters of taxation and roll with the punches when an actor rolls a random disaster on giant novelty dice during sporadic news breaks delivered live on stage and appearing simultaneously on-screen through a videocast.<br><br>The years tick on through dozens of personal decisions and eventually almost all the avatars on screen have IV bags following them around in their dotage.  Following a last huzzah of a user-created snowstorm (if one flake falls every time an avatar jumps...) a pit opens in the centre of the screen, allowing world-weary avatars to hurl themselves into the abyss; survivors can hang on a bit longer but past age 100 the winds of change ultimately blow everyone off-screen.<br><br>The speakers share their final pieces; the players put their joysticks back in the seatback pouches and leave the theatre.

Description=Between is a disjunct cooperative multiplayer game by the art game developer Jason Rohrer. Unlike his previous games, there is no singleplayer element and it communicates through an online connection with another player. Players can choose to join a game with a stranger, or start a new match with a friend based on a "friends code" that is randomly generated by the player who starts the session.<br><br>As with all his games, no instructions are given and the gameplay is only revealed gradually. The game takes place in an abstract, side-scrolling world where a character can be controlled. In the distance, a shimmering image of a tower is shown. It consists of blocks, each with a different squared pattern of colours. The aim of the game is to build the tower according to the pattern, but it is impossible to complete it without the help of the other player who has the same goal, but who is not visible on the player's screen.<br><br>The game consists of three different states, and they can be chosen by going to sleep or waking up, represented by an area on each side of the screen. The player starts with an outlined construction area where the patterns of blocks can be selected and built, to be moved to the tower where they are stacked. The player however starts with three colours: red, green and blue, while higher parts of the tower with complex colours include cyan, magenta and blue. These block patterns cannot be built by the player, but need to be provided by the other player. The other one however does not sees the player's tower and as such the correct patterns are created by accident, or it may just as well never happen, leaving the player unable to complete the game.<br><br>When a part of the tower is completed, a soft sound can be heard. When the game is played by two players in the same room, this can serve as an additional hint for the other player, as the author discourages looking at another player's screen.

Description=BioShock is considered the spiritual successor of System Shock 2 and mixes first-person shooting with role-playing elements. In the year 1960 a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with you as the only survivor. You have the apparent luck of resurfacing in front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating, you enter the door and soon you are taught that this is the city of Rapture, a paradise of free will build in the 40s by Andrew Ryan, visually and socially inspired by objectivism of Ayn Rand. However, even before you assimilate all this new information, the descent to this supposed paradise ends and you only see ruins and chaos. Learning about the destiny of Rapture will be now your main motivation while you have to survive to the horrors that the free will can create.<br><br>A sci-fi plot based on a social system that fails is not the only thing BioShock shares with it predecessor, as many features of its gameplay and even elements of Rapture are easily recognizable in SS2. Bioshock is an FPS, but with many elements that make the gameplay more complex than just shooting your enemies while advancing in the game. In addition to the usual, and not so usual, fire and melee weapons, the main character can use "plasmids", genetic tools created in Rapture that can give superpowers, like telekinesis or fire throwing, to those who use them. The enemies are also more complex, in the sense that they do not always go after your character to kill him. Most of them are inhabitants of Rapture, victims of the bizarre experiments performed in the city and empowered themselves with plasmids. There are also security devices that you can use for your advantage or creatures with symbiotic relationships like the "Big Daddies" and the "Little Sisters" and many others to be discovered. All of these features and some abilities of interaction with the surrounding give the player many ways of facing each situation.<br><br>The entire game takes place in an underwater setting using an improved Vengeance engine, a heavily modified version of UnrealEngine3. Rapture is in ruins, you can see that everywhere you go and water is the key to all this. Water is what surrounds you and the city all the time and what slowly devours it with you inside. The water also helps building the dark atmosphere of Rapture the same way genetic engineering (and underwater architecture) helps establishing the sci-fi bases of the plot. Both, the setting and the plot are completed with many 50s furniture and propaganda,  la the Fallout series.<br><br>The Xbox 360 and Windows version were released simultaneously. A PS3 port was only announced afterwards and was released more than a year later. There are no graphical improvements, except for the "horizontal plus" widescreen option that was introduced through a Xbox 360 patch. The cut-scenes are also in a higher resolution. A new addition is the Survivor Mode with a harder difficulty level.

Description=Bit. Trip Beat is a unique combination of Pong and a rhythm game. The game is played by holding the Wii-remote sideways and tilting it away or towards the body. This in turn moves a paddle on the left side of the screen vertically up or down. The objective of the game is to hit the various "balls" with the paddle coming into the screen from the right. The balls are synchronized with the beat of the game's chiptune soundtrack, creating a logical connection between what players are seeing and what they are hearing.<br><br>The screen contains two bars. Hitting a ball will fill up the top bar until it is full. This increases the multiplier and makes the visual effects in the background more complex, thus increasing the difficulty. The lower bar is emptied if the player misses a ball. If the bottom bar is depleted, the game switches into a black and white mode, similar to the original Pong game, where only the Wii-remote's speaker is active. In this mode, the player has to fill the top bar again to return to normal play. If the bottom bar runs out again, the game is over.<br><br>Bit. Trip Beat has a variety of balls the player has to repel. They are colour-coded to indicate their movement type: orange balls bounce off the paddle multiple times, while yellow balls only travel in a straight line for example. Occasionally, bonus items can be picked up with the paddle, which for example change the paddle's size similar to the power-ups found in Breakout.<br><br>At the end of each level, a boss fight awaits the player. Defeating the boss grants access to the next level, of which there are a total of three. After playing through a level once, it can be selected at the main menu.

Description=Spiritual descendant of the Populous games, Black & White is a 'god' game in which players take the role of a fledgling deity, called upon by people in need. <br><br>Entering the 3D world, players can manipulate objects, move people, and cast miracles. To assist the player, there also exists a creature with its own intelligence and personality. Both the players and their associated creature will evolve during the course of the game, becoming benevolent beings, cruel tyrants, or somewhere in between. As the player's characters develop, both their creature and the land itself will change, depending on their alignment.  <br><br>Although the main purpose of the game is to work through the five lands of Eden and win the faith of as many of the tribes as possible, the game is somewhat open ended in its aspects of wandering, exploring, and developing the sidekick creature.<br><br>The creatures in the game feature their own artificial intelligence and will grow like a child, both physically and emotionally. They'll learn by example and put together their own moral codes based on what they witness and learn. Players can pet or scold their creature, nurture it, spoil it, or abuse it. In the end, Black & White is part strategy game, part role-playing game, part child rearing simulator, and part self-examination of the player's personality.

Description=Bloxter's basic game concept is similar to Columns. Here you play inside a reactor. Your mission is to combine a certain number of energy cells (how many depends on the level; ranging from two to five) either horizontal or vertical. For this purpose, you will drop a 2x2-energy-block, which can be rotated to all four positions, at the top of your energy cells. When you finally combine a row, the energy cells will react (jumping out of the screen). If there are any same numbered energy cells of a different color adjacent, they will chain-react, even if they aren't horizontal or vertical aligned. Once you got a certain number of reactions, you complete the level and you can proceed to the next one.<br><br>The game offers 5 different Zones with 6 Reactors each. Changing from level to level are the number of energy cell needed for an reaction, the number and the type of the bonus items and cells (like a drill to remove cells or a special block which will generate energy cells on its destruction), and the presence or absence of Vanders, these are enemies, which will try to hinder you. An example for these are leeches, which will drain the energy out of a cell, leaving an empty, non-reactive block.

The story takes you and Blue, star of the paper-cutout-animated television show, to her pre-school classroom, where Miss Marigold assigns a neighborhood adventure to the class. You, Blue, and other members of Blue's class will visit five places and bring back something from each location.<br><br>After you choose a color and level and sign in, clicking on the cloud in the upper left corner of your screen takes you to a "Likes" page - the color, animal, food, song, and sport you choose here will be used somewhere in the game. The Parent's area is also accessible here, showing the curriculum goals for the game, and giving parents suggestions for additional activities connected to each neighborhood location. Gameplay uses the mouse (point, click, and drag) <br>and an optional printer for the printable pictures and games available in Miss Marigold's classroom.<br><br>As you and Blue travel through the neighborhood (escorted by Blue's human friend, Joe, who drops you off at each location), you'll visit these places:<br><br>1. The Music Store - Listen to Purple Kangaroo and play instruments in the same order he does<br>2. The Bakery - Learn how to wait your turn and practice finding shapes and colors<br>3. The Library - Match letters or find the first letter describing a picture as you help shelve some library books - choose a book to read as a reward<br>4. The Present Store - Wait on customers; help them find the gift they can afford and count the money<br>5. The Grocery Store - Find ingredients described by Mrs. Pepper, put them in your cart, then check and bag them<br><br>As you finish each area you'll receive a special shape and the neighborhood location is checked off on Miss Marigold's List, which appears as an icon on the top right. Once all the locations are checked off, return to the preschool classroom to discover what the teacher will do with the items you've collected.<br><br>On it's most basic level, Blue's Clues Preschool introduces the toddler to some of the places in a community and what they're for, using characters the child is most likely already familiar with. While he plays, he's practicing some of these skills: color/shape recognition, auditory memory and discrimination, letter recognition/pre-reading skills, number recognition, counting/addition, spatial and size relationships. A higher difficulty level will change the game somewhat to suit the child's learning progress.

Description=Bob Came in Pieces is a physics-based puzzle game. It stars Bob, a call center employee, who follows the supposedly safe intergalaxy route to travel to work, when his ship is suddenly hit by a meteor. The impact ruins his Hyperdrive 2000 and he plummets towards the nearest planet. He hopes for a Space Depot to get it fixed quickly, but as there are no inhabitants, he will need to pick up the lost parts himself.<br><br>In 14 chapters Bob needs to navigate his ship through different environments to locate portals that transfer him to a new part of the planet. Along the way he can pick up a number of parts, but some of these are optional. There are no hazards or enemies that provide a threat. Instead Bob needs to solve puzzles based on physics to progress or to open up entrances. The ship is shaped as a ball with eight ports for extensions. In the basic setup it consists of four thrusters that allow the ship to travel in any direction. After picking up some parts Bob can enter the Ship Builder at specific locations to customize the ship. There are different tube-like modules with different shapes that can be fitted to any of the eight ports, even on top of each other to form complex constructions. This is needed to solve the puzzles. Modules can also be rotated and after fitting them, one or more can be assigned to specific keys. In the beginning the ship can just crash through walls or use thrust power to set mechanisms in motions, but in later parts specific small entrances need to be accessed, or thrusting needs to be redirected to a specific side. Different ship layouts can be saved and restored for later use.<br><br>There are thrusters of different strength and these affect the handling and power of the ship. Special tools include push and pull beams. Puzzles require Bob to shift weights, push objects around, or carry them to a specific location. Levels have different themes, and the rocket thrusters can for instance be used to burn through bushes or planks. Next to lush jungle sections there are ice levels where the ship needs to reach a high speed to break through ice, or gets directed by the flow of wind. The Ship Builder spots act as checkpoints and because of the customization options, there are different approaches to solving puzzles.

The Hunted follows a lone rabbit as he flees from a hostile, axe-wielding hunter.

Description=BOH is a top-down shooter with retro graphics and sound, somewhat comparable to Alien Breed.<br><br>As a member of the Resistance it is the player's goal to repel an invasion of unknown beings. These beings, ranging from bugs to robots to zombies (and more), will spawn indefinitely until the player finds the "Evil Masters", which have to be defeated to complete the missions. To accomplish this task one can find better weapons, shield recharges, enemy detectors and pieces of equipment, such as automappers, light sources and a 360 visor, which, due to initially limited field of vision and illumination, are essential to navigate the labyrinths which missions take place in. Exploration, indeed, represents the game's core.<br><br>Missions are entirely stand-alone, so, except for secret missions not yet unlocked, the player is allowed to select any mission he/she would like to play from the main menu. Some missions are multi-phase, meaning that the player has to complete in strict sequence the phases they are subdivided into. Each mission has a difficulty rating - the higher the difficulty the more complex its labyrinth(s) will be.<br><br>A notable aspect of the game is the fact that the setting can be completely redefined by means of themes - at the time of writing, there are 6 themes that render sci-fi/alien, medieval, underground and pseudo-vectorial environments.

Description=Braid is a puzzle game disguised as a 2D platformer. The player controls Tim during his search for a princess he has known and lost. Although the objective appears to be rather straightforward at first, the meaning and the motives become much more implicit and are interwoven with the mechanics during the course of the game. From a main hub, Tim can eventually access six worlds that consist of different areas. The start of each world reveals a part of the Tim's background and emotions, rather than progressing a storyline. The second to the sixth world can be entirely explored without solving all the puzzles. Difficult situations can be ignored and revisited later. When all worlds have been completed, the first one becomes available and brings closure to the story.<br><br>The game's concept is entirely based around time manipulation. Tim cannot die permanently as the player can rewind time at any moment and usually for any length, even all the way back when an area was entered. While rewinding, the music is synchronized in a similar fashion. Rather than a gimmick, rewinding is an essential element to solve the puzzles. The different worlds give a spin to the mechanic by introducing clones as the player collaborates in a parallel reality with a past version of himself, time can be affected through the movement direction, and Tim can create a circular area to cause time dilation. Certain items, enemies and parts of the scenery are immune to time manipulation or behave in a very different way. Puzzles require close examination of the environment and the behaviour of different items and enemies. As such, the game is entirely about solving the puzzle theoretically by applying the game mechanics and then using trial and error to executive it and discover possible flaws in the proposed logic. This also brings limited replayability to the game.<br><br>A world is solved by collecting the puzzle pieces. These need to be arranged and eventually show a picture related to the game's story. There is no filler in the level design, meaning that every platform, item or game element (except for a few enemies) has a specific purpose to solve a puzzle. Fast times can be tracked in a separate speedrun mode.<br><br>The later released Windows and Macintosh versions are identical, but come with a level editor.

At level 10 this wins the game and provides a new form, an alien monster pic, and a special badge on the high score list.<br><br>The music syncs with the rhythm, movement and speed of the levels and the graphics are altered accordingly. During levels, the gameplay usually becomes faster, making it harder to dodge objects. To compensate, a button can be used to slow down time to get past obstacles with precision. The game's controls are very straightforward, only steering is needed, using the mouse, a joystick or a gamepad.

Like in some game shows, the name of each entry remains hidden until the object is found and collected. Each collected object gives a number of hearts, that are necessary to complete a level and can be used as currency to buy card games and pay for hints. In some instances, the goal is to accomplish a series of tasks by dragging and dropping scenery objects on top of each other, like dragging a light match to a pile of logs to start a fire.<br><br>The hint system is extensive and progressive, with each succeeding clue being more explicit than the last one.

The player can also find bonuses in four colors. Yellow gives a score bonus, blue gives three way shots, red gives an extra life and green makes the player invincibility. The game also features a suicide button that kills the player. Although it cost the player two lives rather than one, it allows him to keep his power ups and score multiplier. <br><br>When starting out only the arcade mode is available but more modes are unlocked as the player gets further in the game. The arcade mode consists of 50 levels and after completion of the first 20 the extend mode featuring 150 levels is unlocked.

Description=Bullet Candy Perfect is a top-down bullet hell arena shooter. It is a remake of the original Bullet Candy using a 3D engine, but originally it was meant to become an unlockable in the game Irukandji. In the end the developer found it to be good enough to stand on its own and released it separately.<br><br>The game can be controlled using a gamepad or with the combination of a mouse and a keyboard. Players direct a space ship that can be moved around and can fire in any direction, regardless of the movement. The game consists of a series of enclosed, single-screen arenas where the successive waves of enemies and attack patterns become gradually more difficult. Next to a basic laser with an unlimited amount of bullets, the ship can pick up yellow power pods. These lead to new weaponry and higher scores. When half of the pods in a single level are collected, the laser is upgraded to a stronger version. When all of them are collected, a smart bomb is unleashed and it destroys all enemies at once.<br><br>While playing, and especially when destroying enemies, four types of bonus items appear. Red ones provide extra lives, yellow one yield more points, blue ones provide triple shots, and green ones make the ship invincible for a short while. Players are encouraged to survive as long as possible with a single life. Not only because all weapon upgrades are otherwise lost, but also because this resets the score multiplier at the bottom of the screen. In dangerous situations the player can opt to commit suicide instead of being shot, as that preserves the upgrades and multiplier. Committing suicide however costs two lives.<br><br>During attack waves the screen is generally crowded with many different enemies, bullets and bonuses, all in different shapes and colours. All objects need to be evaded successfully to survive and some enemies have complex attack patterns. When dying the ship immediately respawns and the gameplay is continued, without having to replay the entire wave. The game includes a high score list and keeps track of the overall progress. There is a basic tutorial and three difficulty levels. High difficulty levels do not only toughen up the game, they also provide multipliers that are two and three times as large, making them the modes where the highest amount of points can be scored.

He dutifully notified everyone of his new address, including his bank; he went to the bank and filled out a change of address form himself. The man was very happy in his new apartment. <br><br>Then, one day, the man tried to use his credit card but couldn't. He discovered that his bank had invalidated his credit card. Apparently, the bank had sent a new card to his old address. <br><br>For weeks, this man tried to get the bank to acknowledge his change of address form. He talked to many blank officials, and filled out new forms, and tried to get a new credit card issued, but nothing worked. The man had no credit, and the bank behaved like, well, a bank. <br><br>It's a sad story, one that gets replayed every day for millions of people worldwide. Of course, sometimes it's not a bank at fault: sometimes it's the postal service, or an insurance company, or the telephone company, or an airline, or the Government. But all of us, at one time or another, feel persecuted by a bureaucracy. <br><br>You begin in your new house. As per the letter in your package, you will fly to Paris just as soon as you get some money to take you to the airport.

The cook must avoid touching the roaming enemies, anthropomorphic condiments and fried eggs that kill the main character. The foes can be destroyed with power-ups, or squashed by the falling burger pieces.<br><br>There are power-ups and bonus items scattered throughout the levels. The ketchup bottle kills all the enemies on the level, the salt shaker stops their movement for a few seconds, the ice cube makes the chef invulnerable for a few moments and freezes the adversaries, the burning cocktail also makes the cook invulnerable for a short time and burns the approaching foes, the bubble lifts the character directly to an upper level and the energy drink makes the chef temporally faster. Potato chips, ice-cream cones, cups of coffee and tea give bonus points, while French fries give extra lives. A Bonus mini-game appears between levels after collecting the letters that form the name of an ingredient, where the player has to find pairs of food items by uncovering several cooking pots, guide the chef through a maze and complete other similar challenges.<br><br>There are two modes in the computer version: in Story Mode, a plot is developed through cutscenes between levels, where two chefs called Peter Pepper and Sally Salt must help their uncle to save the family's burger diner from Vinny Vinegar, the owner of a competing hot dog franchise.

You get the idea.<br><br>Beginning the game as Hulk Hogan, you jump and run along the scenery. There is no scrolling, the game is composed of rooms that you traverse. Hordes of evil Bush supporters will be attacking you, but you can take them down by shooting horizontally or upwards. Each character also has his own smart bomb-like special attack to wipe the screen clean of any harmful entities.<br><br>At the end of each level, some big strong stupid boss awaits you, jumping and using weapons of mass destruction. These are quite original; for example, you won't see Barbara and George Bush sr. copulating often in a video game, but here you will, with George spitting hot lava rocks and Barbara birthing Junior Bushes at you. You'll also fight Paris Hilton in her flying, bullet-shooting cabriolet or Janet Jackson's giant right boob, controlled by Michael Powell.<br><br>Each time you lose a character, you play the next member of in your sturdy freedom fighter band, as long as you still have one.

You'll learn about some political and economic subjects like the evolution of U.S. surplus/deficit, or the changes to the estate and dividend tax and their effects, and many other interesting tidbits of information about the evil doings of the Bush Administration.

As the game progresses, new technologies become available, which you must allow for.<br><br>It is about people and systems. Each building that you build requires you to hire people; people that you see walking the streets of your town. The marketplace needs saleswomen, and buyers. You see the buyers walk to your granary to buy food, which they then bring back to granary. The sales lady walks up the street selling food to the houses she finds, which allows them to evolve to better housing, which pay higher taxes. The people in this game make the difference. Instead of a police station having a radius of effectiveness, it sends out a police officer who can only fight crime and fires he sees. The need to rely on randomly walking citizens, means placement of buildings is as significant as in Serf City/The Settlers.

Description=Play through the year  with Caillou, the bald-headed little boy - animated star of the PBS series based on books written by Christine l'Heureaux and illustrated by Helene Desputeaux.<br><br>After you sign in and choose a season, Four Seasons of Fun opens on Caillous room, where you help Caillou get dressed to go outside by picking the appropriate clothing for the season  select the long pants for winter, for instance, by clicking on them and dragging them to Caillou to dress him. Some of the options are deceptive; several of the hats and shirts should logically be appropriate for more than one season, but arent allowed. However, there is no penalty for wrong choices, just a gentle suggestion to try again. <br><br>After you have dressed him, Caillou goes outside. Here there are a number of interactive objects and games to play, and you have the opportunity to pick up or win items to place in Caillous Nature Book. There are icons along the bottom of the screen that you can select to go home, view your Nature Book, access help, or exit the game, and as you run your cursor over the icons a character speaks the options aloud in a clear, friendly voice. Arrows that appear at either side of the screen will take you forward to the next screen or bring you back to the previous one  very easy for a young child to understand and use.<br><br>Each season has its own activities as well as some that are available year-round: in the fall you can help Caillou clear a path through the leaves on the playground by clicking on the tiles showing the letter he names. In spring, there is a see-saw game where you can help Caillou balance by choosing a partner for him whose number matches a number on the screen. In winter, help Caillou match his snowman to the one his father built.<br><br>There is a Bouncin Ball game in each season (In winter the ball is actually a snowball.)  you select a word that rhymes with a word Caillou says by  throwing a ball at it, and a Race Along game  (Or skate, or  skateboard, depending on the season), where you have to decide whether to move under, over, or around obstacles in your path.<br>There is a Picture Perfect game; choose the items that dont belong in the picture onscreen. This, like dressing Caillou, can be a little confusing at first when you are unable to remove beach-related things from the lawn in front of a house  however, its the season that is the important factor here!<br><br>Four Seasons of Fun will give the 2-6 year-old child practice in several early-learning areas including decision-making, letter and number recognition, pre-reading skills, and ordering of events.

Each game has it's own instructions page, read aloud by Caillou's Mom and repeatable at will; most games are fairly self-explanatory, but some (like Song & Dance) will probably require a parent's assistance to play. There are 4 separate printable activities, each one branching out into several different parts, giving the child lots to do offline and reinforcing concepts introduced by the game. Among the early-learning skills covered are: phonics, memory skills, listening, musical sequences, colors, pattern recognition, counting, and early reading/spelling.

Description=Call of Combat is a free cross-platform 3D World War II multiplayer combat simulator. The game is made in Java and supports OpenGL. It is based on Chain of Command by 2AM Games, following their bankruptcy. The general interface looks similar, but new campaigns and features such as grenade exchanges have been added.<br><br>Each player joins a German or an American team and then controls four soldiers in a squad. With different squads per team controlled by different human players (up to 30 in a single game), the aim is to kill the soldiers on the other side, or to hold the most points in strategic points at the end of the round. Soldiers start with 5 grenades and basic rifles and on certain maps extra weapons such as machine guns, Thompsons / MP40s, ammo boxes or extra grenades are given to the Commanding Officer to assign. Each side has a Commanding Officer, an experienced player to give orders, manage the weapons and ammunition, and make tactical decisions.<br><br>Teams can then be split to cover different areas. The soldiers can crawl, hide, throw grenades, and there are different fire options. Combat happens in real-time, but is often based on stealth and the use of buildings and the environment for tactical play. Visibility is based on a logical line-of-sight system, and you can only see what your soldiers see.

Description=Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).<br><br>At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.<br><br>Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

Description=Carmageddon II is essentially more of the same.  Whether this is a good or bad thing pretty much depends on how you liked the first.<br><br>In case you need to be told, this game sends the politically-correct-o-meter flying towards absolute zero, perhaps only beaten by Duke Nukem 3D.  The framework is a futuristic race inspired by Deathrace 2000 and The Cars That Ate Paris: The contestants, in sport cars, monster trucks, and other motorized abominations, are placed on a track, a real populated area.  Getting to the finish line first is secondary, and in fact seldom happens; the real winner is the one to trash everyone else, running over pedestrians on the way for extra profit.

Description=On her last adventure, the psychic Cassandra was searching for a lost magical ring with the help of Nostradamus spirit. Now she is asked to use her abilities to find Michael, the missing brother of her friend Violet, that disappeared after meddling with the occult. Once again, the ghost of the ancient astrologer will guide her and help fight an evil and powerful force that wants to destroy the world.<br><br>Like its predecessor, Cassandra's Journey 2: The Fifth Sun of Nostradamus is a hidden object game with a supernatural theme. In this installment, some elements of the adventure genre were added to the simple seek-and-find mechanics of the first title. Most of the time, the main objective still is to find and click on all the items listed at the bottom of the screen, on scenes related to the plot and filled with assorted objects. In some locations, the list displays riddles about the items or silhouettes instead of their names. Entries written in blue are pending tasks, where the player must perform a scenery interaction to complete them.<br><br>Some of the collected items are stored in the inventory, accessible through an option at the bottom interface. They have to be used as in most point-and-click adventures, by dragging and dropping them on logical places of the scenery to perform an action or complete a task.<br><br>The help system is extensive with five types of hints available as buttons at the top-left side. Each hint consumes a variable amount of blue mana, with more explicit hints costing more of it. The mana vial is continuously renewed, slowly refilling after being partially drained. From top to bottom, the pointing hint takes 90% of the mana and shows the exact position of one of the required items; the area hint costs 50% and highlights the approximate location of a random list object; the compass hint consumes 80% and makes the crystal ball at the bottom glow brighter when the cursor is near one of the list items; the photo hint uses 70% and shows a picture of the object; the silhouette hint takes 60% and displays an outline of a selected object on the crystal ball.<br><br>As before, magic tricks and mini-games appear between chapters. They are implementations of classic concepts, like four variations of solitaire, jigsaw puzzles, a block removal challenge with cars on a parking lot, a tile-matching game with Mayan symbols, a Pipe Dream puzzle with electronic circuits, a Mahjong game, and other puzzles that take place on a separate screen, where a mechanism of some sort has to be manipulated directly to solve them. After being completed in the main story, the games can be replayed later from the main menu.

The game is played by rotating colorful chain links to connect them to other links of the same color. When three or more are connected, they are destroyed, and the links from above fall in to fill the space.<br><br>In the Classic Mode, the player has to fill a progress bar before running out of moves. The boards get tougher as the levels progress, but when you complete a stage, you can always start a new game from that point. The Arcade Mode is the same as Classic with the addition of a time limit for each level. In Puzzle Mode the player must clear the board of links in progressively harder layouts. And in Strategy Mode, the player must fill the progress bar, but each time they rotate a link, two more are spawned. If the board fills before the progress bar is filled, the player loses.<br><br>Like the original, the player can earn bonus points by matching links with letters on them and spelling the word CHAINZ. Also, there are new power-ups that help clear links. There is a lightning bolt that removes a complete column and/or row. There is a bomb that destroys links in a radius, and there is the Snowflake, which freezes the board and allows you to make lots of links that collapse all at once for big bonuses. There is, however, the Black Link, which cannot be rotated, and makes for trouble because it takes up valuable space.

Description=Championship Manager 2010 is another seasonal update for the Championship Manager series. As a first in the series the game uses a "pay-what-you-want" business model for its pre-orders, so players can decide for themselves what to pay for the game. Players take on the role of a football club manager and perform tasks like training players, handling transfers, scout for talents and decide on match strategies. Player and team stats and are updated to July 31, but regular patches will update it even further.<br><br>Again the interface has been totally revamped to become more intuitive and much more trimmed. The matches themselves are now shown in real 3D which can be viewed from five different angles.

Description=Championship Manager 4 is the latest addition to the long-running series of soccer management sims. Like its predecessors, the interface still consist mainly of text, menus and clickable boxes, which are all easily navigated using a mouse. For most games this distinct lack of graphics could easily mean its downfall, but as CM4 relies heavily on realism, authenticity and an intuitive interface to attract gamers, it actually works very well.<br><br>Though CM4 is visually very similar to its successors, it does offer a few new additions as well as some enhancements to the series. The most notable of these additions is the 2D pitch viewpoint, which is only available during matches. Basically, it replaces the classic commentaries with a top-down view of the match, where you can watch your players live up to your selected tactics (or watch them stuff up in style). Other additions and enhancements include a totally skinable interface, a revamped tactics engine and an enhanced contract negotiating system.<br><br>As for the actual gameplay, little as changed since the last installment. Being the manager still means you're in charge of almost every aspect of your selected club, from hiring staff to setting up team tactics and so forth. And you still have to live up to that pesky club board's expectations.

The press will now ask you loaded questions based on the team's performance and potential signings, and you must deal with these by choosing the valid answer. Also, players now interact in different ways, and do not always get on with each other, as well as having more potential reasons to be unhappy.

A huge number of preset tactics are available, and each player's individual role can be customised for each area of the field. The transfer system allows you to scout for players all over the world and sign them permanently or on loan, with other clubs trying to do the same, and bidding for your players. You choose training schedules for each player, and watch their performance change as a result.<br><br>As well as updating the player and team data to account for transfers and promotions / relegations, a number of new features are included in the game. The transfer system changes in line with new EU rules limiting the length and binding nature of contracts, you can compare player stats side by side, and send players away for rehabilitation. There's also more interaction with the club's owners and the league officials. An extra challenging option of Attribute Masking is added - this results in obscure information being hidden, and requiring more scouting to discover.

Description=Chaos Overlords is played out on an 8x8 grid, said grid representing city blocks. Each block contains three locations of varying significance (hospitals, research centres, etc) which are randomised for each new game. In fixed positions throughout the city are the headquarters of six organised crime syndicates. As the game begins, the player is in control of one of these HQ buildings, and have one gang of 'Right Hand Men' under player control. The aim of the game varies, from eliminating all rival gangs to capturing all HQ buildings, or merely competing for the highest bank balance or prestige (popularity).<br><br>Gameplay is very like a board game. Each turn, a selection of three gangs is made available to the player. From this pool the player may hire or dismiss one of the gangs. An extensive range of gangs is included, from Disgruntled Postal Workers to Renegade Nuns.  Once hired, gangs are dispensed throughout the city with instructions to seize control of the aforementioned locations (obtaining research bonuses from research centres, accelerated healing from hospitals, etc.), shakedown the public for cash, research new weapons and technology or attack enemy installations.<br><br>Each gang may be outfitted with a weapon (ranged or melee) an item of protective gear and one miscellaneous item (performance-enhancing drugs, smoke bombs and 'cool shades' are a few examples). Getting the right gang and researching the perfect accessories for them is where much of the fun lies.<br><br>Combat, when it occurs (which is often) is automated, this is a strategy game, not a tactical simulation. Action is simultaneous turn-based with an optional time-limit to keep things moving.   Multiplayer is supported through hotseat, modem, LAN or internet (TCP/IP) and is more stable than some current releases (possibly due to low average system specs when it was released).

Description=In Chromatron you have to manipulate one or more laser beams with reflectors, splitter and much more so that the targets are activated in the correct manner.<br><br>For example, a level may have 3 static laser, one with red, one with green and one with blue light. Then there might be a cyan, magenta and yellow target. In this specific level all you have are three reflectors (mirror). Now you have to place them on the grid so that the targets get activated correctly, meaning say the cyan target must be hit by green and blue laser beams. Once all targets are activated, the level is complete and you can start the next one.<br><br>The game offers 50 levels to master, increasing in complexity and difficulty (more lasers, different targets, more manipulation devices, obstacles).

Description=The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena includes two single player campaigns. One is a graphically enhanced version of The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and the other, called Assault on Dark Athena, continues the story almost directly after the end of Escape from Butcher Bay with Richard B. Riddick and Johns in hibernation on board of a ship deep in space. A group of renegade mercenaries finds them and brings them on board of their giant ship called the Dark Athena where they transform people into mindless drones. Of course Johns is a too valuable target to transform so they plan to collect the bounty that is on his head after he freed Riddick from the prison. Riddick on the other hand - well he managed to evade capture and is now really pissed.<br><br>As in the first campaign, the player once again assumes the role of Riddick, controlling him a standard first person shooter fashion through the corridors of the ship. But Riddick isn't one who runs guns blazing through the enemies. Instead the dark is his friend. Hiding in the shadows he uses his special ability to see in the dark, sneak up on enemies and perform an instant melee kill with whatever weapon he has currently equipped. This not only applies to his melee weapons that range from his fists to the newly double-carved blades but called "Ulaks" but also to the bigger stuff he'll find on his journey like assault rifles, a mini-gun and such. If he hasn't a gun available, he can pick up a dead drone and use hers. At one point in the single player campaign he'll even take over the control of a full-blown mech to reek havoc on the ship as he did back in Escape from Butcher Bay. If an enemy manages to actually hit the player, Riddick can use NanoMED health units to replenish his health. Since these only have a limited amount of charges he can refill them with NanoMED Catridges scattered around the levels. The bigger NanoMED health units permanently increase his health. And on his way through the Dark Athena he also finds bounty cards, the equivalent of the cigarette packs Riddick collects in Escape from Butcher Bay, unlocking extra content like artworks or personal profiles. <br><br>Completely new to the game is the multiplayer mode allowing up to 12 players compete against each other in several game modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Arena. Butcher Bay Riot and Pitch Black. While the first three are self-explanatory, Arena puts up to four players in small areas in either one-on-one or two-on-two fights while everyone else is spectating and waiting for their turn. Butch Bay Riot on the other hand puts three teams against each other with each team buying their weapons, ammo and armor before each round. With the goal to bring the power node located in the middle of the map to the enemy base, the guards, prisoners and mercenaries don't really fight each other at once. Instead each group has one specific enemy. So the prisoners go after the guards base while the guards attack the mercs. The last game mode, Pitch Black, puts everyone in a dark area with one player playing Riddick with his dual-blades and his night-vision ability and the others all playing mercs only equipped with their weapons and flashlights hunting him down.

Description=Chuzzle Deluxe is a tile matching puzzle game with 4 different game modes and trophies for special events.<br><br>Basically, you have a 6x6 rows big screen, filled with different colored Chuzzles (some sort of pets). Unlike other tile matching games, you don't move the tile (in this case the Chuzzle), but you actually move the entire row so that you get 3 same colored Chuzzles in a group. They then "explode" and the gap is filled with new Chuzzles. Row moving is possible due to the fact that the rows (both horizontal and vertical) are "round", meaning that moving the outer left Chuzzle one tile to the left will result in appearing of it at the outer right position.<br><br>The four different game modes are: Classic, Speed, Zen and Mind Bender.<br><br>Classic works like explained above, but you will also face mega Chuzzles (2x2 tiles big) which can't move out of the screen and locks, which will lock the two rows where it is located. Locks can be destroyed by making a match (mega Chuzzles by the way too). The game mode is level based. Just score as much points as needed for the level and you proceed with the next one. If you run out of possible matches, you can scramble the screen (basically this equals the lost of a life).<br><br>Speed is like Classic, but you play against the clock. With each match, the counter is set a bit back, but as soon as the counter reaches the top, one Chuzzle will be locked. This goes until no moves are possible. Once you completed the level, the locks are reset.<br><br>Zen is a relaxing mode. No locks and no clock.<br><br>In Mind Bender, you job is to recreate a certain given pattern with your 36 Chuzzles. No clock and no special level order required to play.<br><br>For the first three game modes, if you don't know any further, you can buy a hint (reduction of the score).<br><br>The major feature of the game are the trophies. In the Trophy Room, you see 22 placeholders for trophies, which will be awarded as soon as you met the requirements. Those are for example for seven-step cascades (you make one match, which will trigger six additional matches), beating 10 levels of Classic, making a six tiles long match, or playing a game without using a hint and much much more.

At the end of the 19th century the father of the current generation of Covenants reopens their old but abandoned mansion and thereby uncovers strange standing stones on an nearby island. Possessed by this discovery, he locked himself up in the library and wanted to uncover the meaning of those stones. Out of curiosity, in 1899 his three sons and two daughters stole a book about the stones out of his library, went to the island and conducted a dark and powerful ritual which marked the beginning of the end. During the following 20 years almost every member of the family either turned mad and killed themselves or died from something else. <br><br>Now it is the year 1923 and the very last member of the family, Jeremiah Covenant, lies on his deathbed with cancer in his body but he is not alone in his house. The spirits of his brothers and sisters haunt the house, strange events happen and evil creatures stroll through the mansion. In a final attempt to not only lift the family curse but also to put his fellow ancestors to rest, he calls upon Patrick Galloway. Patrick was part of his squad in the first great war and after a fierce battle against creatures, they had never seen before, he had specialised in abolishing such powers from the earth.<br><br>You take control over Patrick and walk around like in every other first person-shooter through the several locations of the game ranging from the mansion itself over other earthly locations to Oneiros and Eternal autumn, which are other plains of existence. On your way you uncover the mysteries of the family by reading books and papers which lie around the mansion or by talking to the few people still alive on the island.<br><br>Also reading might help you understand what is happening here, it won't help you survive against all the strange creatures that hide in the shadows and attack you without asking. It's also impossible to defeat the ancestral spirits without some serious firepower, so besides your trusty revolver, you'll also find several other weapons during the course of the game like Molotov cocktails, your lovely shotgun or a freeze gun shaped like a dragon head. Since you are fighting the paranormal, you also have access to several spells which allow you to see enemies before they see you, revive the dead or shoot Ectoplasm. Since you hold all your weapons in the left hand and you cast your spells with the right hand, it is possible to use both at any time.<br><br>As the name suggests, Clive Barker, the maker of the Hellraiser movies, had great influence in the making of the whole game. He also wrote the background story.

Description=CLUE: Accusations and Alibis is a "hidden object" adaptation of the classic board game. The objective remains the same as in the original: to find the murderer, crime weapon and room where the crime took place before time runs out. Each of the mansion rooms is a separate hidden object location, where the player must find all the items from a list at the bottom of the screen. The flashlight button highlights the position of one of the required items, but removes some minutes from the timer as a penalty. Any type of clock can be collected for 15 minutes of extra time.<br><br>After clearing one of the rooms, a gossip screen appears to start a rumor about one of the suspects, weapons and rooms. The suspects drop clues about the case based on this rumor, and these hints are automatically stored in a log. Four tabs are available at the top of the screen: game map, checklist, evidence and hint log. The game map shows an overhead view of the mansion with all the rooms visible, where the player can choose where to go next after finishing with one of them. In the checklist, the player can mark the suspects, weapons and rooms to keep track of case developments. When a suspect reveals some crucial information ("the axe was not the murder weapon"), the game automatically crosses the item with a red X. The player can review the items found on each room in the evidence tab, including the coat check tickets showing what kind of clothing the suspects wear at the time of the murder. The last tab is the hint log, listing all the clues received so far in the game.<br><br>The accusation screen comes up after investigating all the rooms, where the player has to make a final statement about who the murderer was, what weapon was used, and in which room the crime took place. The game can be replayed with new items on each room, with some of them showing other viewing angles.

The traps/games are:<br><br>1. Owen's Radical Pizza Race: the villain Fletcher Limburger designed a skateboard course to challenge Owen. The course consists of giant pizzas and the skateboard is a giant sub sandwich with wheels. Dodge or jump the pizza ingredients in your path, except for the anchovies, which can be picked up and used offensively in a later level.<br><br>Leslie's Bookerang Library: Alistair Loveless concocted a special library for Leslie. Little demons drop large books into the room. In the back of the library is a theme, such as 'geometry', 'geography', or 'capital cities'. The dropped books each have a title and Leslie must jump on the books that have titles pertaining to the specified topic. Doing so results in that dropped book becoming permanent. Jumping on another book will crush the book. The goal is to stack enough books to escape. There are also special books that Leslie can pick up and store as weapons in a later stage.<br><br>Santiago's Pinball Predicament: Pericles Lear, who is big on toys, creates several life size pinball tables in which Santiago is the pinball. The pinball is actually a small rocketship that Santiago can rotate and thrust. This is still tricky because of all the other things on a pinball table that can bump the ball. The goal is to light up all of the letters on the board (doing so entails solving some mini-puzzles) and then entering the hole that is Lear's mouth. There are also batteries that Santiago can collect to be used as weapons in a later stage.<br><br>Joni's Last-Chance Labyrinth: Ms. Rose creates this deadly plant-filled cavern to doom Joni.

Description=Collapse! is another entry in the color-matching, block-removing series by GameHouse. This entry has nine gameplay variations, and a new avatar system. The basic mechanics remain unchanged: the player has to click on groups of three or more blocks of the same color to remove piles of them from the field and finish the level. If the blocks accumulate and reach the top of the screen, the game is over.<br><br>In the main adventure mode, the player has to complete a series of levels to move the custom avatar on a map and reach the final area boss. Each level has one of the available gameplay variations, with branching points on the path giving a choice between game types. Coins are received after completing each level, to be spent on special items on the shop like avatar accessories, power-ups and to unlock new games for the Quick Play mode. Extra coins can be earned by playing the arcade slots and pachinko machines, and extra items can be won on the spinning wheel.<br><br>The power-ups are stored in an area besides the gamefield, from where they can be selected and used directly on the blocks to destroy them. The super bomb explodes a large area pulverizing all surrounding blocks, the row-column bomb removes a cross of tiles, the color bomb eliminates all the pieces that share its hue, the rainbow bomb deletes all the squares that share the color of the selected block, the hourglass temporarily stops the continuous addition of new rows to the field, the scrambler shuffles the blocks, the warp bomb sends a series of tiles to another board, the row bomb makes a whole line vanish from the game, the gravity bomb moves all blocks from one end to the other, and the color swap bomb moves all pieces of one color to another board.<br><br>The variations encountered on the Adventure Mode can be accessed later and played directly on the Quick Play Mode. In the Classic game, lines of blocks are continuously added to the bottom of the screen, and the objective is to remove all the tiles to clear the board. In Relapse, the rows are added to the top and the bottom of the field. In Strategy, new blocks are only added after other tiles have been removed from the board. Continuous is an endless variation, where an infinite amount of pieces is added to the field until the player can't keep up and the game is over. In Puzzle, the goal is to carefully remove all the tiles of a drawing made with the blocks, without any new pieces entering the board. The remaining four variations, Double Classic, Double Relapse, Double Strategy and Double Continuous, repeat the previous mechanics but add an extra grid to be managed by the player.

Description=Once again, your mission is to remove a cluster of same colored blocks, at least 3, but the more the better. As soon as these blocks have vanished, the blocks above of them will fall down and filling the gap.<br><br>And while you remove blocks in the level, the game pumps new rows from the bottom in. So you must remove them faster as new rows appear and the blocks stacking up. Once all rows are in the game, you win. If one block reaches the top, you loose.<br><br>The game offers four different game modes: ZigZag, Big, Crunch, and Perplexor.<br><br>Big is the classic Collapse mode. It works like explained above. New rows appearing without doing anything, so waiting too long can be fatal. The speed of new rows increases from the beginning of the level to the end, but also the general speed from level to level. There are two possibilities for new rows: full 28 block rows or 14 block rows with a gap between each block. The gap will change the structure of the blocks in the game (while one vertical row stacks up, the other don't). There are Power-Ups in this game mode, which will help you, but can also hinder.<br>This game mode is identical to Traditional from the predecessor, but is more then double the width, that's why it's called Big.<br><br>ZigZag is a strategy variant, so new rows only appear when you clear a cluster. ZigZag is referring to the playfield, while the blocks in the other three game modes are ordered in a rectangle, this is ZigZag. Means: odd numbered vertical rows are like normal rows, while the even numbered vertical rows are shifted a half block up. For this game mode, you have infinite time for your movement.<br><br>Perplexor is similar to the Puzzle Mode from the predecessor. You have to remove all blocks, if one remains, you loose. You also have so much time as you want. The greatest problem in this game mode is, that you can't use all of the blocks at the beginning. The playfield is divided into two different areas. The bottom area looks like in Big and works like in ZigZag. The upper part is partly hidden, but can't be used at all. Once you clear something in the bottom part, blocks from the upper part will drop down.<br><br>Crunch is the most unique of the four. The playfield has blocks centered at the four edges. In the middle is a big mine, if the blocks hitting the mine, it's Game Over. Instead of putting new lines into the game, now it's just blocks.

Description=One day a meteor fell on Earth, spreading a new substance called Tiberium. This substance was unusual and powerful, yet highly dangerous since it turned anything it touched into Tiberium itself. By 2047, Tiberium has spread and infested most of the Earth's surface, causing an ecological catastrophe. Red Zones are areas rendered inhabitable due to the severe Tiberium infestation and constant Ion storms, covering 20% of the planet's surface. Yellow Zones are areas infested by Tiberium but they hold most of the world's population. These areas are filled with civil unrest and are war-torn and ravaged but cover 50% of the planet's surface. The remaining areas are Blue Zones, areas safe from Tiberium infestation and possibly the only salvation for humanity, covering 20% of the planet's surface.<br><br>The Global Defense Initiative upkeeps the Blue Zones, keeping them defended and using special technology to keep the Tiberium infestation at bay, while the Brotherhood of Nod takes advantage of the chaos and civil unrest in the Yellow Zones to recruit their forces. However, they hadn't been heard of for years, supposedly disappeared... until now. Kane returns, commanding the Brotherhood of Nod once again to launch a serious assault against the Global Defense Initiative and its Blue Zones, starting the Third Tiberium War. Later on an alien race called the Scrin shows up, considering the planet eradicated and looking to harvest the Tiberium, but instead get caught up in the war.<br><br>Following the tradition of the series, Command & Conquer 3 is designed to be a fast-paced game, where players build up their bases to produce a powerful fighting force to destroy their enemies. Being able to play for any of the three sides, they'll have a huge selection of infantry, vehicles and aircraft to fight with, as well as structures to aid with new technologies, upgrades and the all-powerful superweapons. Unlike most games of the genre, players do all their building from a tabbed sidebar, allowing them to create production queues and deploy structures quickly and easily. Maps also have various buildings spread around which can either be garrisoned to provide further protection or captured to give players that extra edge.<br><br>In campaign mode you can fight the war for either of the sides (the third side is only available after playing the other two), playing out the storyline through various missions with high-definition FMVs and popular actors giving you orders, and winning medals based on your performance. You can also play in skirmish against the AI, or in multiplayer (network/online) against human/computer players. Online play has support for rankings, clans, VoIP, and a new feature called BattleCast, enabling players to watch or download replays from battles directly from the website, or even provide commentary like an online sport.<br><br>The Xbox 360 version is fairly identical but altered for the console's controls. The interface has been moved to the bottom left on the screen and the tabs on the right have been replaced by context-sensitive menus players can scroll through using the D-pad. Selecting and building units or constructions is done through the A-button and the triggers. The buildings show processes without having to select them. A tutorial explains the controls and advanced players can also create custom shortcuts. The Xbox 360 version supports the Xbox Live Vision camera.

As the sole inheritor of a series of fairs from a long lost relative, the player has to build attractions and rides on vacant lots to meet the goals of each stage.<br><br>Each stage is a different empty lot, shown as isometric pseudo-3D graphics on the screen. At the top, there are several calendar pages acting as the timer, showing the remaining days before the park closure. A "day" takes only some minutes in game time. Right below the timer, several blue tabs show the stage goal, that usually is to profit a certain amount of cash, to build a number of specific attractions or to achieve or surpass a percentage of popularity.<br><br>To build something, the player has to hire some mechanics by clicking the staff button at the bottom. Nurses, security guards and janitors can also be hired to maintain order in the park. Clicking on the cash register button brings up a series of tabs showing the available attractions to buy, categorized in rides (of three sizes), game stands, food vendors and sideshows.<br><br>Each attraction requires an amount of electric power to run, shown as blue meters along with their fun factor, capacity and pricing options. The electric power available is displayed in a meter at the bottom, alongside a button to purchase more juice to the park's grid. After acquiring one of the attractions, the player has to place it in the lot, moving a transparent version of the building over the terrain with the mouse. Placement can be hindered by space restrictions, and the overlaid terrain becomes red when is not possible to build upon it, and green when there's enough room for the attraction. Construction time depends on the number of mechanics available and the size of the building.<br><br>After constructing one of the attractions, their options can be accessed by right-clicking on them. The player can change prices, purchase upgrades and dismount to make room for new or larger ones. The purchased buildings are still available after being disassembled, and are stored in the menu tabs.<br><br>Random incidents occur in the park: customers getting sick or hurt, rides breaking down, along with acts of vandalism and littering conspire to reduce the fair's popularity. When it happens, circles with crosses, badges and wrenches symbols and advisor notes appear on the screen, and the player has to click the icons to dispatch staff to deal with the problems. Sometimes, municipal officials appear to inspect the current conditions, and if their minimum standards are not met they can issue a fine.

Whilst Artaud's quest is fictional (with some added supernatural events), the setting is quite real, with actual locations visited and use of historic figures.<br><br>Artaud's quest will see his home in Dun-le-Roy wasted in a siege, travel across the Mediterranean to the port of Acre, and eventually to the Holy City of Jerusalem.

Description=Deus Vult is the expansion pack for Crusader Kings, a strategy game based on the EU engine and set in the Middle Ages.<br><br>Changes and additions for Deus Vult include:<br>- While the original game had no ledger, as opposed to all other EU games, the expansion features one, which also includes a much-wanted page to review all potential brides for your ruler.<br><br>- Characters can now gain friends and rivals in the course of their lives. Friends are more likely to help a character, while rivals will actively conspire against him/her. Waging war between rivals is also more likely, as claiming a rival's title costs less Prestige.<br><br>- Characters can also send sons and daughters to another court as fosterlings. While this means a parent will lose control of his/her education, it improves relations between both courts.<br><br>- Children, at birth, have now a value of 0 in all stats, and these develop as the child grows up. Links between parent stats and children stats are thus removed. This means also that the culture of the child will be taken from the home province of the parents, not from the parent's culture itself.<br><br>- Realm-wide, the expansion adds the concept of Relations between courts, similar to other EU games. Stability is the other addition, although it doesn't work like in EU2. Instead, it is modified through events and can influence other events as well.<br><br>- In the original game, Loyalty was an affair between vassal and liege. In Deus Vult, however, courtiers also feature loyalty to their ruler. Low loyalty courtiers are likely to move court or work against their ruler if they are in charge of a court position.<br><br>- Graphics have been reworked and added to make Deus Vult more visually appealing than the original game. Deus Vult has been given also minor overhauls to the interface, such as "back" buttons to some windows.<br><br>- When negotiating peace, is now possible to force the vassalization of the enemy or to pledge allegiance to the victor.<br><br>Other changes to the original game include: the possibility to remove very old claims from a ruler's list, much increased attrition when marching through neutral provinces while at war, tweaks to the combat and siege rules, possibility for revolting provinces to declare independence and give counts and dukes more freedom when deciding to whom pledge allegiance.<br><br>The event scripting engine has been also greatly expanded, being the most relevant feature the possibility to save a target character for use later in the event or in a following event. However, historical events or flag markers as in EU2 were not added.

Description=A mouse-driven game in which the player controls a small, circular spaceship which must travel around the screen collecting crystals. This task is made more difficult by the aliens which constantly swarm out from the portals on both sides of the screen. These can be shot down by the ship's gun (which has unlimited ammo) or eliminated by activating one of the player's limited supply of "smart bombs", which will clear the screen of all current enemies.<br><br>The physics of the game were quite unusual for the time; the ship does not simply follow the mouse's movement like a mouse cursor. Rather, it retains its inertia, and must be carefully guided around so it does not crash into anything. Bullets, when fired, travel in the direction of the ship's movement, requiring the player to actually travel toward enemies in order to shoot them down.<br><br>This was the first color game for the Macintosh, although it was business-as-usual for the IIgs.

Unlike CP, the player can't add anything to each level's arrangement of shapes -- but they can subtract from it, drawing a simulated blade across the screen's surface and cutting away portions of inconvenient blocks -- tipping and tilting everything resting on them in a precarious new direction, boxes sliding around according to a familiar simulated physics.  The player needs to be careful, since gravity is always pulling down and the green target pads are relatively small, but they have as many tries as they like to take on the small handful of levels, and as many cuts as they need to perfect a given level's solution.

Description=Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks.  They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!<br><br>Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him.  Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid.  Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him.  Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map.  In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited.  Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.<br><br>Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision.  Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death.  (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)<br><br>Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon.  Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.

Description=Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble! plays like a vintage boardgame, set in Brigiton, USA, in the 1920s. Players control a queen and her gang of high school girls set out to solve mysteries, flirt with boys, tease their peers with naughty games, and charm or deceive oppressive adults.<br><br>The game cannot be classified under a single genre, as it incorporates and mixes many new and existing elements. At the start of the game, players select the queen of the gang based on four general statistics that play an important role in the game: popularity, rebellion, savvy and glamour. Starting at the school, players are presented with a game board where the pieces mark encounters or event. The queen's first task is to recruit three girls for the gang and they can be won over by playing a mini-game. The gang then sets out to solve a mystery that will take them to different locations, combining adventure gameplay with role-playing elements.<br><br>Even though the general storyline is linear, there are numerous approaches to progress in the game with events that are entirely optional or can take different twists. The girls have conversations with other people, gather items and pry for the game's "currency" - people's secrets. The game has a day and night cycle and certain events only occur on specific moments.<br><br>Most of the progress is achieved through recurring mini-games. Based on the basic abilities, the girls can specialize in a certain game, such as taunt-and-retort where new lines and answers are learned similar to the insult swordfighting from the Monkey Island series. Other ones are Expose, where a secret needs to be decrypted by revealing and guessing words, and FIB as a variant of poker where you need to bluff to have the best hand, or call another player's bluff. Based on the outcome, girls are able to boost their abilities regularly. Events and choices in the branching storyline can also influence general statistics.<br><br>Another way to get the upper hand is by getting them a boyfriend. They can flirt through a game where the girls need to match their interest largely based on intuition. Having a boyfriend boosts stats (when choosing them wisely based on compatibility) and they can also save a girl before leaving when they lose a game. A final game, Gambit, is learned during the course of the game, as it is only played by adults. That one can be considered an advanced version of rock, paper, scissors, with deeper strategy. When a girl loses a game, she will often disappear for a few hours out of embarrassment. <br><br>Girls will often talk to characters based on the information they found, with different dialogue trees. They can also gather together to combine their information and reach new insights. There are many prizes to be won (secrets, items, information) and four full gameboards to explore. The game's retro-like, faded vintage graphics are accompanied by blues and ragtime music from that time.

Description=Deer Avenger is a parody hunting game where a well-armed deer named Bambo assumes the role of protagonist. The deer is out to take down as many humans as he can find who are wandering through his wilderness. The player selects from 3 weapons (an M-16, a bazooka, or a sling-shot) and then selects from among 3 locales (green West Virginia or Connecticut, or snowy Minnesota). The gameplay consists of roving on an overhead forest map and searching for signs of recent hunter activity (such as beer cans, nudie mags, tree carvings, or a name written in the snow with urine). Then the player can hunt from that point which involves scrolling through a 360-degree panorama of the area, waiting for humans to show up. Bambo can also try to encourage humans to show up with assorted calls.<br><br>The emphasis of the game is the comedy aspect. Bambo has a variety of quips and calls that he rotates through during the game depending on the situation. Further, there are other touches such as when you use your binoculars to get a closer look at the region.

Description=Deer Avenger 2 is an obscene parody of the many deer hunter games seen in the PC market.  Only this time...you're the deer.<br><br>One late afternoon, our hero spies a hot-date doe, and he's hoping to get some tail.  But before he can make a move three redneck hunters pop out of nowhere, and mow her down with their truck.  Angry with revenge, the testosterone-laden deer picks up his high-powered tranquilizer gun and follows the tracks back to the city...<br><br>Using your tranquilizer gun, it is up to you to hunt three targets across three different levels.  In order to find your targets, you will have to travel to the local suburbs, an office building, and a shady bar.  But before the hunters will reveal themselves, you have to take down the locals first.  Bikers, neighbors, office workers, and local beer-chugging idiots will stop your every attempt at urban domination.  Deer Avenger 2 features side-scrolling looping levels, where you pivot around one point and aim 360 degrees around you.  Aim your gun with the mouse, and hold shift to take cover.  In case you get into a tight situation, you can also fart to take out enemies around you.  Make sure to shoot pieces of the scenery as well.  You never know if something will contain life-giving salt lick.<br><br>Deer Avenger 2 is a parody and has a silly undertone to it.  All levels and cut scenes are completely 2D and animated, making it feel like a cartoon.  The game pokes fun at "rednecks", who are often the butt of many grotesque jokes the game throws out.  The content and dialog provided also acts as a commentary to the mocking undertone in the game.

The prosecution quickly accuses a local businessman called Elliot Brown of the crime, prompting him to hire the "Defenders of Law" firm to clear his name and find the real culprit.<br><br>Defenders of Law: The Rosendale File is a hidden object game with adventure elements. As one of the lawyers of the law firm, the player has to investigate several places related to the case trying to find evidence to help the client. Most of the time, this involves finding and clicking on all the items from a list at the top of the screen, on scenes filled with objects scattered through out the scenery. At the start of the case, the player can turn the time limit on or off by choosing between the Adventure and Relaxed modes. On the timed mode, wrong clicks reduce by a few minutes the time left to solve the case. The hint button shows the position of one of the required items, but takes several minutes to recharge after use. Although the victim is always the same, details like the guilty party, the weapon and crime scene are randomly selected each time a new game is started.<br><br>As the game progresses, three tools become available at the bottom-left interface that must be used to collect some of the list items. The flashlight creates a spotlight around the cursor that can be moved around darkened rooms to find all the necessary objects. The magnifying glass shows a close-up view of parts of the scenery, disclosing small items. The ultraviolet light has to be used on a dim room to reveal stains, footprints and other hidden evidence.

Description=This open-source, freeware remake of an old puzzle game from 1987 updates the graphics and sounds while recreating the original gameplay. Each level is a puzzle room filled with obstacles and viewed from above, where the objective is to use a series of mirrors to guide a laser beam towards a receiver device and complete the stage. The mirrors are stationary, but can be rotated to deflect the light to several directions, with some turning automatically all the time. The player must configure the mirrors and carefully avoid the mines and walls that reflect the laser back to itself, causing the emitting device to overload and explode. Bomb detonators have to be activated and destroyed to open a passage to the receiver. Other features change the behavior of the laser: the prism bends the light in random 90 angles; the optical fiber nodes act as a portals, transporting the beam to another place of the board; logical doors have internal mirrors that absorb or deflect the laser when hit at the correct orientation.

Description=Sometime during the 2050s, the world is a dangerous place as terrorists, drug czars, and outlaw states rule, using violence and subterfuge as tools in their push for global conquest.  A deadly virus dubbed "gray death" is running rampant throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as "Ambrosia" manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French terrorist organization "Silhouette" bombs the historic symbol of friendship between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, it's mission is to attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service. While JC's brother Paul is already an active agent, JC is beginning his first day of service when the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) suddenly raid a supply of Ambrosia at UNATCO headquarters.<br><br>Deus Ex is a dark cyberpunk RPG in which the player assumes the role of JC Denton, UNATCO anti-terrorist agent.<br>Pitted against an elaborate global conspiracy, he must interact with characters, pick up weapons and complete objectives.  While DC is essentially fixed within the mission-framework of the game, he can be customized with different skills in areas such as weapons, technical skills and physical prowess. The game world is somewhat expansive and fairly open to accommodate different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on he player's preferred style of play. JC can also augment himself using  nanotech to enhance or add extra abilities.<br><br>The game interface is typical of a first person RPG/action-adventure game.  The world is rendered in first-person 3D and camera segues are sometimes interspersed to transition the gameplay or expose new story elements.  Combat takes place in the same interface, mostly in the style of a first person shooter. Deus Ex blends shooter type gameplay with touches of RPG character development, stealth and multiple solutions to many puzzles.

Description=Long ago a secret war raged between Heaven and Hell, each using humanity as its pawns. While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power, they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent them from escaping.<br><br>As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead. Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth, and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram.<br><br>Players start by choosing their avatar's class: either Warrior, Rogue, or Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item's maximum durability. The Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana.<br><br>Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel's shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced spell levels can not be learned if the character's magic stat is too low. Upon destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of the quest.<br><br>Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation. Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other to steal one another's items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area.

Description=This is an adventure/puzzle game intended for 5 - 7 year-olds, following on the heels of Kutoka's earlier Didi and Ditto: Kindergarten.<br><br>After you sign in on the first page and choose a difficulty level  (1, 2, or 3 bugs, for easy, medium, or hard), you are transported to a countryside scene where you listen to short setup story about how the Wolf King has taken over Jakos Valley and placed his purple lieutenants in various places around the map. Didi and Ditto, 2 brave little beavers, decide to put a stop to his rule, and make a bet with him that beavers are smarter than wolves. The king agrees that if one beaver can outsmart all his lieutenants and win all the flags and royal medallions from them, he and his minions will leave the valley forever.<br><br>You have agreed that only one beaver will make the attempt, and you must choose which  Didi, the girl, or Ditto the boy  and then click on a map of the Valley to travel to the area of your choice. After each puzzle, you return to the map to pick your next place to explore.<br><br>Each area of the map holds two puzzles (16 in all)  one to win a flag, and one to win a medallion, both of which you will place in your backpack. The pack stays conveniently off-screen until you run your mouse over the bottom of the picture; then it pops up along with a flower that will exit, and a leaf that will take you back to the map.<br><br>In order to win a flag, you must help a friendly animal out of a tight spot; the puzzles vary from helping to decide on measuring tools/units, to fetching a teddy bear from a mine maze while you block a couple of frogs from the exit. The medallion puzzles entail besting a wolf lieutenant at a game of wits, ranging from selecting letters and punctuation from a typing table to match a short sentence, to finding shapes on a table by following directions (right, left, between, etc.), and than arranging them into a tangram shape. Each puzzle is preceded by a clear explanation and a little tutorial; even so, some of the puzzles may be beyond the capabilities of the first graders the game aims at. In particular, there is one puzzle that involves using the arrow keys in a mine to drop rocks into moving cartsthis was not simple! Another puzzle requires you to catch things falling down a waterfall, according to directions specifying living or non-living  it was fairly difficult to identify the items and move quickly enough to catch them all. Many first-graders may find themselves frustrated, although you can return to any puzzle at any time to complete it.<br><br>This game is designed to reinforce skills the child is learning in school; simple addition, measuring, shapes, letters and reading, punctuation, rhyming, classifying and sorting, and reading maps, among many others. There are also some creativity pages that you can access  - after solving a puzzle involving color mixing you are able to paint your own picture, for instance. After helping a group of turtles practice their music, you are able to select a drumbeat and click on the turtles to make music of your own which can be recorded and played back. At any time you can visit the Activity menu, where you can directly access the educational mini-games; there are four tabs, for Math, Reading, Science, and Creativity. There are also a number of mini animations starring friends of Didi and Ditto that you can watch during the game by clicking on different parts of scenery. In addition, this game includes a Teacher Mode, enabling a teacher or parent to track the child's progress.

Description=Bored with her dreary job in the office, Flo starts up her dream job -- running her very own restaurant. You and Flo build a restaurant empire through 50 levels in five different restaurants of seating customers, taking their orders, serving their food, and cleaning up after them. Speedy service and good atmosphere is needed to keep the customers happy, and keeping them happy is the best way to get huge tips.<br><br>The player must balance service for the five different customer types, each with their own quirks. For example, the business lady is very impatient, but eats very fast and gives very big tips, while the senior citizen is extremely patient, slow to eat, and cheap (he's got to save his retirement money, after all). There are also two chain systems to keep track of, a service chain for doing the same service multiple times in a row, and a seating chain for seating customers of the same color in the same seat.<br><br>The Wii, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions support multiplayer games - cooperative, competitive (with tip wars for instance, where the first player to reach a certain amount of tips, wins), and team based with up to 8 players.

Description=Flo is back, but this time, she is on vacation.  Join Flo as she works as a waitress while on vacation.  Flo was planning on just taking a nice, quiet vacation, but she keeps losing her clothes and needs to work to make money to buy new clothing.<br><br>The gameplay is very similar to the other games in the series.  You play as Flo, who is a waitress.  Your job is to seat and serve customers and to clean up after they leave.  Different customers act differently, with some being very patient, some being loud and annoying, and some being in a hurry.  Also, each person is a certain color and if you can match the person with a seat that is the same color, you can get bonus points.  First, you'll need to seat your customers.  Then, when they are ready to order, you will take their orders and then serve them their food.  When they are done, you can collect their money and clean up their table.  Sometimes, there will be other things to do as well, such as serving drinks or desserts or cleaning up spills.<br><br>There are some notable differences in this game from the previous games in the series.  Some of those differences include sometimes having 2 babies at a table having "love birds" as a customer type.  Also, you are not working at regular restaurants... you're on vacation.  Instead of restaurants, you will serve customers in different locations, such as on a cruise ship or a train.  Sometimes, you will even have to serve customers in the dark, with only a flashlight to guide you.<br><br>During the game, you will unlock new clothing and you will be able to dress Flo up in a variety of different shirts, pants/shorts/skirts, shoes, hats/sunglasses, and aprons.  You can also upgrade each restaurant.  However, unlike in previous games in the series, you can upgrade any part you want to instead of having to only upgrade items in a specific order.  You only have a single upgrade option for each item, though... no choosing different colors or designs.

Description=Dofus is a 2-D Flash-based tactical MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that uses cute manga-inspired graphics.  The humorous fantasy land of The World Of Twelve is like an interactive comic book.  6 dragon eggs named Dofus have disappeared in the province of Amakna and the greed of people to get their hands on the extraordinary powers they emit has resulted in people and cities coming to blows.  There are also strange occurrences such as weird animals appearing and even new lands rising from the sea.  <br><br>Servers exist for different language communities and there's a F2P account with access to the zone of Incarnam for new players and to the city of Astrub and most of its outlying areas.  A P2P account allows access to the whole world of Dofus, plus PVP factional battles and being able to go above level 30 in profession levels.  You control a character avatar from one of twelve classes (including Pandawa's Flask which are only available as P2P)  through the world in isometric view.  Your character gains levels through completing quests and defeating monsters.  Points are awarded to life, characteristic and spell levels.  You can take up a profession, join a group to attack a dungeon, or join a guild. <br><br>It has a PvP + PvE turn-based fighting system which allows for hundreds of tactical possibilities. When you attack a monster, you are transported to a copy map where no-one else can join and take turn using spells to either attack, buff, drain or heal Action Points or Movement Points.  There's 20 class spells plus some common weapon mastery, elemental or mount-taming spells that can be bought, exchanged for or looted from monsters.  Challenges are issued at the start of a  fight to perform certain limited moves and if players complete the challenge their reward is amplified.<br><br>You can learn up to 3 professions (in collecting, crafting or magus fields) and with enough experience you can gain specializations.  Also, you can align yourself with the warring factions of Bonta (City of Angels) or Brakmar (City of Demons) and wear a shield, and access exclusive areas and resources.    Bounties may sometimes be placed by a special NPC on a player of an opposing alignment.  Players who find and kill targets with a bounty get a reward of bonus experience points.  On some servers, players can take out contracts on others for which a mercenary alignment will take on those jobs.  Guilds can also be formed to allow players to speak and coordinate events, mark houses and paddocks with their insignia, and place perceptors on their maps to collect taxes from battles fought there.

The first battleground: the destroyed city at Ostgar where humans and Grey Wardens meet the Dark Spawn to prevent death and destruction before it has even begun. Of course something went wrong and it is up to the player to unite the races of Ferelden and finish off the Arch Demon.<br><br>Dragon Age: Origins is a classic RPG played from the third-person perspective in real-time with the ability to pause the game at any time - at least on the PC. While the console releases are the same in story, multiple-choice-dialogues, items and overall gameplay, they differ from the PC-version in terms of controls and interface and are much more action-oriented. The PC-version on the other hand features extensive tactical options in combat. This includes an editor which allows the players to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Nonetheless the player can also control his party with up to four members one by one, switching between the characters, using their special talents and abilities to overcome the many different enemies.<br><br>During the course of the game, the player will have the opportunity to invite up to nine players to his party. While only four can leave the party camp at any given time, the experience points earned by killing enemies, fulfilling quests or simply opening a chest are granted to each member of the group - no matter where they are, making the player more flexible as every character stays in the same level-range.<br><br>At each level-up a character earns three attribute points and one talent point. The talent point is used to unlock new spells and abilities in the extensive talent tree differing greatly between the three available classes: warrior, rogue and mage. Every three levels the character also earns a skill point allowing him to learn or get better at herbalism or increasing his survival skills. In addition, at level 7 and 14 he earns a specialisation point which allows him to learn two of four class specialisations like shapeshifter and spirit healer for the mage class. These specialisations give instant bonuses to certain attributes and unlock five exclusive talents. But in order to learn such a specialisation, it needs to be unlocked first. This is either done by buying the corresponding book for a good amount of gold from traders or by learning it from another character, may it be an NPC or a party member.<br><br>Of course not everyone is willing from the start to teach the player. Especially the player's party members have to have a certain level of trust and satisfaction. Satisfaction can range from -100 to +100 and is influenced heavily by the decisions the player makes during the game. Talking and giving gifts to the party members also increases their satisfaction. A high level of satisfaction then grants the party member a bonus to specific attributes and unlocks additional quests as they open up and tell their past. In addition it is possible to have a romance with up to two of the party members if the player character is of the right gender and makes the right dialogue choices.<br><br>Although the main part of the game is the same for every character created and will only differ in what the player decides to do first or what choices he makes, the game features six unique origin stories - two for each race (except the humans who share the magi origin story with the elves). They all tell the story how the player's character met Duncan and ended up at the battle at Ostagar and also introduce at least one character that will become very important to the player during the course of the game.

This second part, named Dragon's Lair II: Escape from Singe's Castle completes the game, continuing the adventure of Dirk the Daring after slaying Singe the Dragon.<br><br>Dirk the Daring is controlled by the player, who views Dirk's actions on the screen from third-person. The game is reactive and players must press the right controller direction or action button at the right time to have Dirk avoid traps, defeat monsters and otherwise stay alive.

Description="I wish, I wish, with all my heart<br>to fly with dragons in a land apart" -  Emmy and Max, from the Dragon Tales show<br><br>Cassie, a young dragon from Dragon Land, has volunteered to help three of her siblings earn their Dragon Badges and learn to fly. As she guides them one by one through Dragon Land they each encounter different situations where they need to give assistance. Among them:<br><br>1. Arlo needs to have some junk fitted back into place in his Junkpile - find the right spots for each shape. The items can be dunked in the shrink and grow pools to change their sizes<br>2. Zak and Wheezie, a double-headed dragon pair, can't agree on a toy to play with - choose a toy that meets both of their requirements<br>3. A giant has stumbled outside Mr. Dustfree's house and shaken up all his shelves - each shelf needs to be sorted by finishing patterns. There is also a Swirloscope to re-assemble and play with - place crystals on a lens and spin it to see the intricate patterns that are created.<br>4. The Royal Horseflies have gotten loose and must be re-captured and put into number-defined groups<br>5. Princess Kidoodle is trying to draw, but someone keeps sweeping off the objects she's sketching - the player chooses which item is the missing one<br><br>As each dragon finishes a group of games correctly, he earns a Dragon Badge. Once all three have their badges they can proceed to the training grounds for more mini-games and arcade-style flight lessons.<br><br>All actions are accomplished with mouse-clicks; most of the time the cursor is a yellow star that throws off sparkles when there is something to click on, but in some activities it takes on a special shape, such as a net, or an arrow. On the lower left of the screen is a back arrow, and on the right, a character who will help by explaining the current game. At some points there will be a rainbow-hued shape on the left that allows the player to exit or start a new game, and a house icon on the right that takes him back to Cassie's house. This game explores a lot of pre-school skills, most of them precursors to math learning. Skills include counting, number recognition, logic, patterns and sequencing, shapes and sizes, matching, memory, and classifying.<br><br>Dragon Tales: Learn &amp; Fly With Dragons is based on the Dragon Tales Public Television series created by Nina Elias-Bamberger, which is in turn based on original characters created by Ron Rodecker.

Born with a magical power that brings drawings to life, only this little girl can save the kingdom from the dark rule of a tyrant. The only hope rests on three beacons of light that must be set ablaze on distant points, to ward off the shadows that took over the land.<br><br>Like its predecessor, Drawn: Dark Flight is a traditional first-person, point-and-click adventure game with simple puzzles created for casual players. As in most games of this type, the main objective is to collect a series of objects and use them on logical places to solve puzzles. The items are stored in the inventory at the bottom, from where they can be dragged and dropped on appropriate portions of the scenery. A padlock at the lower right corner can be used to lock the interface in place, or to make it disappear when the cursor is away to shown more of the elaborate background graphics.<br><br>The cursor is context-sensitive, changing into a hand when touching an object that can be collected, transforming into a jigsaw piece when placed over a hotspot that needs one of the inventory items, morphing into a magnifying glass when resting over a scene portion with a zoom view, becoming a speech balloon when floating over a speaking character and twisting into a pair of bent arrows when hovering over a piece that can be turned around. Certain places on the scenery shimmer to indicate interactive hotspots, sparkling until their related tasks are complete.<br><br>Some mini-games and puzzles take place on a separate screen, where pieces or mechanisms of some sort have to be manipulated directly to solve them. The hint button is the portrait of Franklin, a ghostly figure that initially gives vague clues about the objectives when activated, with hints becoming more explicit after each successive click.

According to the legend, she is the one that will bring the light back to the world. This isn't liked by the King and his evil Chancellor who has put a curse on the village.<br><br>The game starts with the player arriving at the entrance to the tower. The young girl, Iris, writes a message on her scarf and throws it to the player. She asks the player for help and to free her from the prison that the top of the tower has become. Once inside the tower the player meets Franklin, the girl's servant who has been turned to stone who tells the player what needs to be done. All the doors in the tower are locked by magic and the player has to find a way to open them so that he can get to the top and save Iris.<br><br>Drawn: The Painted Tower is a first person point and click adventure game targeted towards casual audiences. As the player moves around the tower, the player will find many different objects to interact with by clicking on them. Some of these can be picked up and added to the player's inventory, while others will open up a puzzle or pop up a new close-up image of the object. Objects that have been picked up can then be used to interact with the world. <br><br>Iris has a special magical gift. She can create paintings that act as magical doors to enchanted worlds. The problem is that most of these painting have been marred by the curse, and one of the major features of the game is to restore these paintings and travel to the different worlds. This is done in a number of ways, for example finding the missing canvas pieces and then using these on the painting. Also, everything that Iris draws becomes real. For example, to enter the tower in the first place the player gets a drawing of a handle that can be used as a real handle.<br><br>Franklin the servant, who the player meets early in the game, serves as the game's hint system.

Another resemblance Dream Chronicles shares with Myst is its presentation, which is the same pre-rendered 3D stills viewed from the first person perspective.<br><br>However, due to its casual nature the game incorporated a number of limitations to the formula of classic adventure. All of the game puzzles must be solved within the limits of one screen and player is not allowed to move any further, before solving the puzzles for a present chapter. Previously completed chapters cannot be revisited either, and all the jewels left in them are gone for good.<br><br>Dream Chronicles boasts a fairy-tale approach to its artwork and music, trying to create an interesting and gripping story through the series of visions, diary entries and various comments on the events by the game's protagonist.

The objective of each level is to destroy all the enemy robots to activate a teleporter and exit to the next stage.<br><br>The main characteristic taken from those earlier games is the ability to connect the robots to one of the roaming foes, effectively taking control of the other machine and adding it to the army. The number of transfer points available is displayed at the bottom-right corner, with new ones received at every 1000 points. Larger robots require more transfer points to be transformed into a friendly unit, with the cost displayed on top of the machine when attempting a transfer. The robots recruited this way are carried from level to level, and the units can be upgraded with power-ups, new armor and more powerful weapons. The player can switch between any of the available robots with a button.<br><br>After reaching the limit of eight robots, new units acquired start to replace the older ones in the roster.

Description=DropTeam: Mechanized Combat in the Far Future is a multiplayer-focused action game set in the future. Every player takes control of a tank and participates in a civil war in the Rim galaxy. The tanks are simple to control with a keyboard/mouse-combination but in other aspects, e.g. damage and weapon range, the game tries to be as realistic as possible.<br><br>The game features several different maps and mission goals but the basic principle is that a match has a fixed time frame, typically between 30 and 60 minutes, where the players battle each other and solve tasks like capturing the enemy flag or conquering a point on the map. Every successful action rewards points and in the end the team with the most points win. When a player dies he can set his respawn point. One player per team can play as commander and gives orders on the tactical map. The Ogre playing mode is a bit different because there one team consists of just one player who controls a giant tank.<br><br>The maps and objectives offer several different tactical approaches. One aspect of this are the various different tank models which can be chosen, For single players there are the possibilities to play single matches against bots in 20 scenarios and a campaign with ten missions in a linear order. The core gameplay doesn't change for these missions.

Description=A bunch of university kids at MIT (soon to be the guiding lights behind Infocom) played the pioneering cave-crawling treasure-hunting text adventure ADVENTURE and thought "Hey, we can improve on that!"  Around June of 1977 they pooled their collected creative juices and cranked out a sassy successor in MDL on a PDP-10.  It didn't have a name, so they just used a hacker nonsense word in place of one temporarily -- "Zork."<br><br>This game presented the next in a long line of treasure-hunting protagonists with a vast Great Underground Empire to explore -- provided their lantern didn't run out of juice -- and whimsical obstacles among the Flatheadian ruins forced players to employ lateral thinking to collect wondrous treasures worth thousands of zorkmids... and deposit them in the trophy case back aboveground.  If this sounds familiar, it's no coincidence -- Zork/Dungeon is the primordial clay from which the first three games of the Zork series were fashioned, following some extensive refitting of set pieces -- due to the game's enormous size of one megabyte, making it commercially available for home microcomputers, with their limited memory and storage capabilities, was not considered a viable plan in 1979... until they came up with the idea of segmenting the giant dungeon up.<br><br>(Ports of this game also exist for VMS, the Acorn Archimedes, and the Z-code, TADS and GLK software platforms.)

So Edna has to find a way out of the asylum and discover why Dr. Marcel, the leader of the institute, keeps her there against her will.<br><br>Edna Bricht Aus is a classic 2D point-and-click adventure comparable to titles like Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle.

The player has four commands available ("look", "take", "talk" and "use") through which he can command Edna to interact with the environment. It allows Edna to pick up, combine and use items, talk to other people with dialogue trees and ultimately solve the many riddles that stand between her and her escape from the asylum.<br><br>Harvey also plays a very important role in everything. Since he is, as he says himself, a projection of Edna's consciousness, he not only has a funny comment on almost everything in the current location, he also helps Edna to remember doing specific things. In a process called "Tempomorphing", he can lead Edna back into the past to a situation where she learned a particular skill that is very useful in the present. In these visits to the past the player can control both Edna and Harvey, but only Edna can interact with the environment. Harvey instead scouts the proximity and examines various items. Since he can't use these items, he only acquires a topic from it. When the player then uses such a topic on Edna, she will be inspired to do stuff with that particular item or just say what she remembers about it. By doing so Harvey will ultimately inspire Edna to remember and use the skills she needs in the present. When the travel to the past ends, the game returns to the asylum and Harvey becomes uncontrollable again.

Or you could just enjoy the view.<br><br>The graphics run in a higher resolution than the original BBC version, and the wireframe graphics can be swapped for filled polygons and even more advanced 3D effects depending on platform and version. Input devices not thought of when Elite was first written, such as mice, can also be used.<br><br>In 2002, distribution of all versions of Elite TNK was shut down, along with further development, at the request of David Braben.

Description=Emberwind is a fantasy retro platformer inspired by the 8-bit era of games. It is set in the land of Dalriada where the human Kingdom of Grendale has ruled from many years. Its people were watched over by the guardians of the earth from Elderwood: gnomes, brownies and fairies. When king Gyro is crowned, he introduces industrial inventions, putting down roads and installing street lights, and the need for protection by the earth spirits diminishes. Satisfied with the progress the king calls for a big celebration, but he disappears on that very night. The gnome Kindle is warned and decides to investigate.<br><br>Players control Kindle as he travels through the country to find out what is happening. While searching for the king, his most important goal becomes freeing the villagers from the invading gremlins. He usually has to locate about six homes per level and light the fireplace to save the villagers and push back the invaders. Levels often have multiple paths, in the clouds, running over the roofs, to sections at different heights and even under the ground. Kindle's most important weapon is a staff. Starting with a basic attack, the first stages feature skill books that open up new moves, such as the barrel roll, cannon ball and multiple combos. There is a complex pattern of movement, including double jumps, wall jumps, a dashing jump with much more height and a rocket jump to reach very high areas. Kindle can also hide for enemies and use his cover to remain almost invincible for a short time. Much of the game is spent exploring and using a quick succession of jumps to reach new or hidden areas.<br><br>Levels are filled with items such as donguri, jewels and coins. These build up a score that provides Kindle with additional life points at set intervals. Donguri can also be used at wishing well to receive a large amount of loot. Secret passages often contain chests and enemies also leave behind items. There are many different opponents and they often come in large numbers. Using the different moves they can be juggled in the air for a long time to build up combos or chain attacks, unleashing fireworks or special attacks that hurt all enemies on the screen. Next to an endless steam of gremlins, there are flying creatures, cannons and moving towers, along with other hazards.<br><br>Scattered around the level are brownies. These companions need to be located, can be swapped, and provide additional power along the regular attacks. They release magic dust that puts enemies to sleep, shoot donguri, release tornadoes, capture opponents in floating bubbles, or launch an explosive fireball. Kindle can mark checkpoints by lighting lanterns. When dying (there is an unlimited amount of continues) the game starts from there, but without the acquired brownie. Regular health can usually be refilled by saving villagers and gathering food in their houses. The rarest of items are the fairy stones with the flamesprite. They are well hidden and collecting three of these, divided over different levels, provides a melee damage attack upgrade. Kindle is always guided by three fireflies and they often reveal the location of hidden caves.<br><br>Level progress is shown on a general map screen. At any time players can return to an earlier level to pick up missed items or get a better score. Between levels Kindle is carried by his companion Wick, a giant snow owl. Wick also receives his own bonus levels. After completing a boss battle, a bonus stage opens up where Wick can fight in the skies against the army of the cloud king, much like a side-scrolling shooter.

Description=After they had fought out their civil war on their homeworld called Stroggos, the Strogg ventured out into space to conquer other planets and study other races to integrate them into their own. In 2060 they enter space above their next target: Earth. The Global Defense Force (GDF) is completely overwhelmed by the attack of this highly advanced force but they don't give up and fight for their survival. Ultimately Earth will fall into the hands of the Strogg and the events which lead to the beginning of Quake II will unfold but until then, you'll be an important part of this last battle for control over the planet!<br><br>As a successor of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory focuses on objective driven gameplay rather than just capturing flags like you do in the Battlefield Series. This means that on every map one team needs to fulfill an objective while the other needs to guard it. For example on the map "Valley" the GDF needs to build a bridge, then drive a MCP over the bridge to a nearby outpost, hack a Strogg-shield so that the MCP can fire a missile into the Strogg base so that the GDF can enter it and destroy a generator.<br><br>To make it even more complex, most objectives need to be completed by a specific class. On each side are five classes and each class has special abilities. The engineer for example can build the bridge on Valley, repair damaged vehicles or deploy identities while the Field Ops supports his teammates by handing out weapons and deploying artillery systems. Since the maps are all pretty big, you also have access to several kinds of vehicles ranging from little quadbikes to helicopters.<br><br>Unlike most multiplayer-games, the teams in Enemy Territory: Quake Wars don't just have a different skin but are actually completely asymmetrical balanced from classes over weapons to vehicles. This means that while both teams have a medic, they both function differently. The GDF medic for example behaves like every other medic by instant reviving his teammates but the Strogg technician needs a few seconds before his dead companion is alive again. To balance this out, the Strogg technician can turn dead GDF soldiers into spawn hosts. So if he dies, he respawns at such a host (if it hasn't been destroyed).

In some levels, Knobby has to rescue trapped creatures, or collect an item before the exit portal starts working.<br><br>Hitting the space bar or the right mouse button erases the lines and makes Knobby stop. Hitting them again makes the character resume his movement. There are three bars at the top of the screen, one for the amount of ink left (it replenishes automatically when not drawing), other for creative power and a last one for health.

The default tolerance values for these groups can only be changed by National Ideas and the new Decisions.<br><br>"Rebels with a cause" have been introduced. The game now differentiates between a number of different types, such as nationalist, colonial and noble revolts, all with different behaviors. Heretics might convert your provinces to heretical beliefs, nationalists are likely to defect or declare independence, and so on. If you are unable to defeat the rebels you can sometimes also surrender to their demands, resulting in loss of prestige, policy slider changes, and other rebel type specific demands.<br><br>Decisions is another important addition, which comes in three kinds: Religious, country, and province decisions. Decisions are somewhat like the normal events in EU3, but are are "on-demand" and can be enacted at any time, as long as you meet the requirements. There are both generic and country specific "flavor" decisions, letting you institute the Spanish Inquisition or the Russian Patriarchate, or the forming of Great Britain or Spain.<br><br>And the list goes on. For example: the naval game, Papacy, Holy Roman Empire, diplomacy have all undergone various changes. There are more advisor types, an option to use scorched earth-tactics, elections and parliaments have been added to republics, a new mission system, and the AI and Interface has received a number of additional tweaks.

Description=This expansion, as its name suggests, adds to the timeline of the original game that ended in 1789 to encompass the Napoleonic wars, up to 1820 along with new events and event chains, such as revolutions, changing the location of one's capital and the dismantling of the Holy Roman Empire.<br><br>Trade: One common player complaint about EU3 was the requirement to micro manage the sending of merchants to various Centers of Trade (CoT). Napoleon's Ambition allows the player to auto-send merchants to the CoT's of his/her choice, along with three levels of precedence deciding which CoT's to send to first. CoT's outside of a country's original area now start out as closed, so after discovering new trade centers in the east or the new world, one needs to use either diplomacy or war to gain access to the new markets. There is now also the possibility of opening new trade centers.<br><br>Colonization: The race for colonization was generally regarded as happening too early in the game, so the concept of Colonial Range has been introduced. It is based on one's level of naval technology, and prevents you from colonizing too far from an established city.<br><br>Interface: Several new ledger pages makes have been added to make it easier to choose where to build what and and to give easier access to information. The trade overlay map that previously only showed the coverage of the CoT's now also shows which goods are produced where, allowing for less random clicking when deciding on where to place manufactories.<br><br>Additional options have been added to customize gameplay. Players will now have options for "No Inflation", "Free Colonisation", "AI Aggressiveness", "Historical Monarchs", etc.

Description=Europa Universalis: Rome is a stand alone game based on the foundations of Europa Universalis III, taking you further back in time and allowing you to play from any date from around 280 B.C. to near the birth of Christ. Conquer the 'known world' as Rome or one of the other major states of the period or simply survive these growing empires as one of the smaller groups of people. <br><br>EU:Rome features an enhanced graphical engine over its predecessor, a smaller scope, and a number of tweaks specific for the time period. It is a grand strategy game that runs in "continuous time" (like most Paradox games), where the clock ticks away at the user's discretion, from paused to the passing of days within seconds. You control the overall guiding spirit of your chosen faction, developing your economy, military, infrastructure, and technology. War is handled on an operational level, with little direct involvement aside from making sure your armies are as large and prepared as necessary and your generals are the best choices for their situations. Games can be won on diplomacy, deception, and/or war, with the best results coming from balancing those actions and doing what's best for one's nation. <br><br>Taking a page from Crusader Kings, another Paradox game, EU:Rome incorporates some role playing elements as your nobles, politicians, and leaders are represented with detailed characters, each with their own histories and traits. They are born, seek fame and power, get married, win and lose battles, develop vices, and die. While you don't babysit a dynastic family as in Crusader Kings, you do get to watch and control as these various individuals develop friendships or hatred between them and, along with their various traits, these relationships can either make your country stronger or lead to an eventual civil war.

Description=EVE Online is an online RPG which is set in a futuristic galaxy. The main focus of the game is open-ended space travel with combat, territorial control, trade, and politics. In the beginning of the game, you create your character, choosing one of the available empires and races (EVE has no classes, anyone can learn any skill), and customizing the way the character looks. Then you are given a space ship with which you can begin the exploration of the game world. One of your main goals in the game will be to upgrade your ship in order to be able to defeat space pirates and other players. Most items in the galaxy are player-made, and there is a robust economy. With the money you obtain from mining, exterminating NPCs, or cunning market trading you can also increase your character's skills (for example, Mining, Survey, Refining, Drone operation, weapons skills, and many, many others). Unlike most other RPGs, leveling up does not depend on the amount of foes you have defeated, but requires you to train for a time period dependent on your stats.  Training continues even while logged off.

Only the most courageous ones dare to dwell on the surface, forming communities and building new cities. Many people live in Vaults, huge underground dwellings. You play the role of an inhabitant of Vault 13. Recently, the water purification controller chip was broken. Without clean water, the people of the Vault cannot survive. You are sent to retrieve a chip from another Vault. And you venture outside, to face a dangerous world and to find your place in it.<br><br>Fallout is a RPG that utilizes a character development system called S.P.E.C.I.A.L.

You can specialize in various types of weapons, become proficient in conversations with people, etc. The game world offers a non-linear exploration: you can either follow the main story or perform one of the many sub-quests, visiting the game's locations in your preferred order. The game utilizes a turn-based combat system. Your party members (if you recruit any) are controlled by the computer AI. Each action (movement, attack, using a healing item, etc.) costs you action points; once they are depleted, your turn ends.

Description=This collection is a set of four "retro games" based on fondly remembered titles from the 1980's. <br><br>BOT<br>Your mission is to prevent the Mother CPU from completing its military conquest of the planet. To succeed you'll need to pass through 5 levels of BOT soldiers shooting them at will, including a larger BOT boss at the end of every level. Try to pick up extra grenades, armor protection, and more powerful weaponry along the way to assist you in accomplishing this task. Finding the experimental lightning gun is especially helpful, since it inflicts twice as much damage on enemies as your normal gun.<br><br>BUBBLE TROUBLE<br>You control a spaceship which you must use to clear the starlanes of subspace vortices (which look like terrestrial water bubbles). You must avoid contact with these vortices and shots by your own weapons, or your energy will slowly drain away. Your ship is armed with two weapons: guns, which are weak but use up little energy; and penetrators, which are strong but use up much more energy. Ship energy is used for thrusting, subspace jumping, and conducting repairs. Shields are used for defense only, and you lose shield power when you come in contact with vortices, bullets, penetrators, saucers, or stationary energy barbs.<br><br>FLAK ATTACK<br>A horde of robot commandos are attacking your base from the skies above. You control a single gun which you must aim and fire to stop the invaders, but don't run out of ammunition, or your base will certainly be destroyed. When a robot parachutes to the ground, it will walk towards your base and stand beside it.  When 4 robots gather on one side of the base, they will destroy it, and the game will be over.<br>The enemy ships include satellites, jets, and helicopters.  Satellites fly past at high speeds, but they cannot harm your base directly. Jets fly overhead quickly, and the pilot will eject if you fire enough shots at it. Helicopters drop parachuting robots as they pass. Friendly UN Helicopters will drop extra ammo on your base if you let them fly peacefully overhead. <br><br>MOLE'S QUEST<br>As Monty the Mole, you must rescue your belongings which the miners have scattered throughout the mines after they destroyed your beautiful home. Jump from platform to platform from the left to the right, grab the belonging, and jump back to the left to safely pass each level. Each time you save ten belongings, you will see an animation of Monty taking the rescued belongings to his new home. Since the mines are covered with radioactive ooze, you must limit your exposure to no more than 5 minutes at a time. That should be sufficient time to rescue each of your belongings. Every time you save a belonging, you will be given a password, so you can continue from the level where you stopped, even if you shut off your computer.

Description=Fatale is dubbed an interactive vignette by the authors and tells the story of the biblical character Salome. Young and naive, she is said to have pleased her stepfather with a seductive dance, acting as a proxy for her mother Herodias, to have John the Baptist killed. It is said Herodias bore a grudge against John for claiming her new marriage was unlawful. Salome is granted a favour because of her dance and asks for John's head as per her mother's instructions. Rather than retelling the story directly, this project also uses the loose drama interpretation by Oscar Wilde and presents various aspects of the story in three very different acts, without providing direct or linear answers.<br><br>In the first act, the player controls John the Baptist from a first-person perspective in the cistern where he has been locked up. Through a game mechanic based on veils, his thoughts are made clear and he can also get a hint of Salome's dance. The second act is the largest one and has an unknown protagonist. The player is able to float over and through the terrace where the dance took place. Much like the aftermath of a battle, all clues of the events are present and left for the player to explore, piece by, piece, using a puzzle mechanic. There are a few characters around, but these cannot be interacted with. Instead, the environment is presented as a living painting where the many aspects of the story are hinted at.<br><br>The third act is the least interactive one and requires the player to restart the game. It shows Salome's dance from a distance, with the option to zoom in according to a certain rule. The game is largely controlled through the mouse, along with a number of keys.<br><br>The concept of Fatale is more reminiscent to The Graveyard than Tale of Tales' previous project The Path, which takes much longer to complete. Some stylistic effects are inherited however, such as a dramatic zoom view, whispered words in the soundtrack, graphics with grain, and distorted colour effects.

Some pieces can only be accessed after solving one of the game's puzzles. The assembled objects are stored in the inventory, and they can be dragged and dropped on the scenery to solve puzzles. The inventory can switch places with the list of pieces pictures by clicking an arrow on the top of the tab.<br><br>Each stage has three different historical locations. The player has to go back and forth, assembling objects and using them on their appropriate places. In most screens, when the cursor hovers over an area with a missing object, its silhouette appears for a brief moment as a clue.<br><br>Sometimes when using one of the inventory objects on the correct area, a window opens up containing one of the mini-games. These can be implementations of well-known classic titles, like Breakout, Tic-Tac-Toe, Mastermind, sliding tiles and jigsaw puzzles, or a simple and direct interaction with some scenery object, like a drawer or a safe. These sections can be skipped with a penalty of twenty minutes added to the final score.<br><br>The inventory has a separate section for toolkit items, special objects that don't need assemblage and must be used on specific places. When clicked, these hotspots open up a circle surrounding a scenery object showing icons of the required tools.<br><br>The hint button shows the exact position of one of the missing pieces, but takes about a minute to recharge after use.

Description=Football Manager 2010 is the sixth entry in Sports Interactive's series of football management simulations. The previous game introduced a new 3D match engine and Football Manager 2010 follows down the same path with several updates for the engine. It's been upgraded with 100 new animations, new stadia and crowds, an improved AI, and better lighting and pitch degradations. <br><br>The new match analysis tool allows the player to find strengths and weaknesses for both his own team and the opposition.. With it the player can see where on the pitch shots, passes, crosses, headers, tackles, fouls and interceptions have happened. This can be seen both during and after matches for both teams. <br><br>A new tactical module has been introduced too. It's meant to make it easier for the player to give orders for the team to follow. The new module features thousands new options and allows the player to shout out instructions directly from the touchline. The old tactics system is till in place though for those players that would prefer that. <br><br>The user interface has been redesigned with both aesthetic and navigational changes. The old side menu has been replaced with a tab system which is meant to allow the player to reach the different areas of the game more quickly. <br><br>A new data editor is also introduced. Now it's possible for the player to add new competitions of his own. Not only can he add competitions and extra levels for already existing levels but also completely new competitions and leagues.

Description=Football Manager Live is a online-only managerial soccer simulation where the player is responsible for the financial and athletic success of his club. The main difference to regular games of this genre is that the players don't manage an existing club but create their own. The next important step is to choose the association which represents how much time the player wants to invest in the game, a weekend association for example just plays on the weekend and professional leagues impose a (of course just virtual) fine when a player doesn't show up to matches. Every new club, however, has the same budget for transfer and salary which he uses to choose his players from the database with 330.000 athletes - of course every one can only be employed once per server. This process also can be delegated to the AI.<br><br>There is no tight schedule for matches, just a date when it has to be done. This means the player can freely challenge other players for championship or exhibition matches. If one or both players are not online at the time the AI steps in and the players can watch the game later. The matches itself don't use the new 3D engine from Football Manager 2009 but the old 2D presentation with white and red dots which represent the players.<br><br>Of course there are a lot of settings the player can influence his team with, especially regarding tactics and training. But unlike the main series the player also has full responsibility over the financial aspects, e.g. building a new stadium. But every setting has to be unlocked first. Every manager can learn one new respectively a better level of an ability at the time and than has to wait a certain time until he can use it, e.g. free kick instructions in 15 hours. This is in real-time, this means the player also learns when he is offline.

Description=Foreign Legion: Buckets of Blood is an action-based, stylistic third-person shooter. As the sole surviving member of a Foreign Legion assault team the player is tasked with defending a nameless village from hordes of invading rebels. A particular emphasis is placed throughout on the game's distinctive visual design, which gives the notably bloody nature of the game a lighthearted feel. It's additionally augmented by a dynamic soundtrack, which reacts to in-game events and pace.<br><br>Gameplay is largely action oriented with a distinctive arcade bent; being explicitly designed with short, intermittent playthroughs in mind. The village's civilians have barricaded themselves within the Town Hall and must be protected until the arrival of a rescue helicopter, represented by an ever-present countdown timer. The Legionnaire must fend off successive waves of enemies within the small, defined area surrounding the Hall; each following wave being more numerous and better armed than its predecessor. As more enemies reach the Town Hall they forcibly wear away the barricades and defenses until the civilians are reached, at which point each successful attack will kill some number of them. If all of the villagers are killed, the mission is aborted.<br><br>The player is better armed than his opponents, bearing weapons that range from a pistol to a localized air-ride, despite being outnumbered by a wide-range of different enemies, such as suicide bombers and semi-automatic wielding assault units. Enemies will also opportunistically maneuver against the player depending on the circumstances, climbing over roofs and circling around his sides. For the majority of weapons ammunition is limited, and so at any point the player can rush to a local communications tent in order to call in support via drop ships, which supply additional ammunition and repairs for the Town Hall.<br><br>A general score is kept throughout the game, for entry on a high score board, which is represented visually by a slopping bucket of blood. It's filled by particularly violent achievements, such as successful head shots and pre-maturely detonating enemy bombers with well placed shots. Fortunately a secondary-fire option is featured, viewed directly over the shoulder, which increases the player's accuracy at the cost of movement speed.

Each level has one or several enemy buildings and the goal is to conquer all of them. As in Qix the player can move around the borders of the playfield safely. By moving inwards and leaving the base line the player draws lines. This makes him vulnerable towards the enemies. By connecting his line with the base line the player can conquer land. Any enemy that is encircled will be killed. The monsters of Fortix are different kinds of dragons with different capabilities. The player also has to watch out for towers that shoot pellets whenever the player leaves the base line. These can be taken out with the use of catapults. These are triggered when the player encircles an halberd icon. There is one catapult for each tower on the map. Towers can also be taken out by conquering the land they are on. <br><br>There is different kinds of terrain in the game which impacts the movement speed of the player. Walking on grass is fast while water and swamps are slower to traverse. There is also walls that the player can't move through and has to find a way around. The player will find power ups scattered around the levels which he can pick up by encircling them. These can do many things from increasing the player's speed to freezing the monsters for a short time.

Description=In Maze Madness, Freddi's friend Luther has managed to accidentally scatter Grandma Grouper's kelp seeds throughout a gigantic set of underwater mazes.  You control Freddi Fish, who sets out to find and recover all of the missing kelp seeds.<br>  As she advances through 50 levels (plus bonus rounds), you'll need to solve simple puzzles, avoid pesky critters, and pick up special items which will help her on her way.  After all of the kelp seeds have been picked up in a maze, Freddi will automatically advance to the next round.<br><br>The player controls Freddi by using the mouse or keyboard.<br>The cursor keys move Freddi, while the Enter and Ctrl keys allow Freddi to fire when she has the Bubble-Shooter power-up.  If you choose to use the mouse, simply move the cursor arrow to a target location for Freddi, click the left mouse button, and she'll attempt to swim toward the target - Freddi will be able to navigate corners, but only one at a time, so if she's unable to swim to the target, try breaking the trip up into shorter pieces.<br>  If Freddi has the Bubble-Shooter powerup, she'll fire bubbles if she is directly facing the target, and if the mouse button is held down briefly.<br>The game allows multiple people to play the game with their progress recorded under their own name. The game allows you to save or exit the game after each level is finished, and previously finished levels can be re-played.<br><br>The game also comes with a level editor, that is icon-based rather than text-based so non-readers can use it.

Description=Set in the American West of the 1880s, Freddy Pharkas was one of the fastest guns in the west. However in one particular gunfight with an outlaw named Kenny he was outgunned and Freddy had his ear shot off. This traumatic experience caused Freddy to give up his pistols and enroll in the school of pharmacology. Blocking out the memories of his past, Freddy arrives in the town of Corsegold with the dream to own and run his own pharmacy. Working with the town's doctor, Freddy is able to fill prescriptions, mix concoctions and diagnose simple symptoms. Business among the townsfolk is brisk however, the good times are not to last as suddenly townsfolk are run out of town and businesses are being foreclosed and boarded up. Freddy must deal with the town's problems, and discover the larger plot, or risk having a fancy shop in an empty town and losing all his customers.<br><br>Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist is a humorous point-and-click side-scrolling adventure game from Al Lowe. As such it has many similarities to other Sierra adventure games including Leisure Suit Larry (Al Lowe's previous work) and King's Quest. Players use the action bar at the top of the screen to choose an action type that is used on locations and objects visible to the player. Freddy can walk to new locations, look at particular objects, attempt to use objects, talk to people and enter his inventory to access items that have been picked up. Like other sierra games, successful actions add to the player's score, judging the player on 1000 points.

The game comes with different modpacks that incorporate the rules of the different Civilization games as well as the popular settings of Freeciv players.

The main objective still is to colonize and conquer the American continent, by exporting goods back to Europe and importing colonists to establish new colonies and expand the dominance in the territory. The player must fight or make alliances with other European nations, and deal with the native population by means of force or peace. Finally, when a new nation is fully developed, the ultimate challenge is to declare independence and survive a war with the royal army and loyalist forces.

Even a cursory glance at the screenshot will make you wonder: What kind of game is that?<br><br>The objective is simple and conventional: The Frequons are invading! Destroy them before they reach the bottom, by moving the mouse onto the frequon. Sounds easy enough, huh?<br><br>Well, the game is complicated as it doesn't display the frequons directly, but in a "two dimensional fourier space": All you see is a colourful band of waves, which change according to the relative position of the frequon to the mouse. When you get close to the frequon, you'll see dark bands appear, if you get even closer, the dark bands widen until the frequon itself is revealed as a dark spot. Move the mouse on it to make it explode.<br><br>The game is so abstract that, as the author states it, "unless you dream in complex exponentials, you may be quite flustered the first time you play." A configurable training mode exists to help you develop an intuition to detect the frequon's positions. The training mode can also be used just for fun to create interesting wave patterns!<br><br>While the first levels are quite easy, later levels are made harder by having more frequons at the same time, resulting in more complicated wave patterns, or by damaging your radar, thus limiting the displayed information, like showing the only magnitude of wavelength, or only some primary colors.<br><br>As in Space Invaders, you can never win this game; all you can do is destroy as many frequons as possible before they get you. Your best performances are recorded in a high score table. Sound is limited to some blibs when a frequon appears or is destroyed.

Description=Funny Faces' game concept is simple. You have a 8x8 big playfield, filled with different kind of balls and of course the funny faces. You job is now to select a group of at least 3 balls of the same kind, which then vanish and balls/faces from the top falling down, filling the gap. 3 balls of course is the minimum and therefore awards only a few points, but you can remove a dozen balls at once if you can.<br><br>So what's up with the funny faces? All those balls are static, you can remove them, but you can't change their positions (i.e. to create bigger groups). But that's what the funny faces (human, monkey, bull, and rabbit) can do. Click on one, and all adjacent balls and faces move one cycle counter-clockwise. If you get two funny faces of a kind together, you get a combo and many points. The more combos you get in a row, the more extra points you earn.<br><br>The game offers four game modes: Classic, Timed, Clear the Board, and Relax.<br><br>Relax is just like explained above. You have all the time you want to play as long as you want.<br><br>Time works like Relax, but you have only 2 minutes time to gain as much points as possible.<br><br>In Classic, you don't have this at-least-three-of-a-kind rule, so you can also remove single balls if you like. This game mode works level based. As soon as you earned a certain amount of points, you advance one level. The difficulty here is that you have to remove a certain amount of balls per group per level. In level one, the average amount of balls per group must be at least 1, in level 5 its 5, and so on (level 10 is max). As this is level based, you have a level meter, showing you progress. But you also have an overload meter, which is climbing too. When the overload meter reaches the end before the level progress meter reached it, its game over. To make sure it does not, simply remove the certain amounts of ball per group as stated.<br><br>Clear the Board works also without the 3-of-a-kind rule, but it is like the first two game modes without levels. You job here is to remove all balls from the board. Note that no new balls dropping in like in the other game modes. You also have only four funny faces, one of each kind.

Description=Games That Didn't Make It is a compilation of eight previously unreleased Epic Banana games. Several of the games are unfinished and a number of them stretch the definition of what one could reasonably term a game.<br><br>1. Flying Face - Less a game than an interactive experiment in<br>Pascal. A face flies across the screen, bouncing whenever it comes in contact either with the sides of the window or the user's mouse.<br><br>2. Kung-Fou - In essence a fairly small screen saver. A fellow is<br>attacked by two men wearing ski-masks and proceeds to beat them within an inch of their life until you quit.<br><br>3. Old Extreme Prejudice - A top-down shooter wherein you play as a special forces operative infiltrating a number of suspect<br>organizations. Sometime in it's development it was superseded by an experiment in platforming, which ultimately became the Extreme Prejudice that was eventually released. Due to it's unfinished nature the game is<br>fairly short and has very few of it's features actually integrated<br>within the game. There is a small, player versus player multiplayer component. <br><br>4. Plah - You run around in a small, sparse world alongside two<br>brown blob monsters. You're capable of firing small red pellets but<br>they do absolutely nothing. You cannot otherwise interact with your<br>environment and the game has no objectives.<br><br>5. Stan the Swordsman - A simple side-scrolling medieval platformer. Travel through two levels combating the forces of evil, such as spiders, with your trusty sword.<br><br>6. Terrorism - A text-based action game featuring three different<br>scenarios based around combating the Dark Sun Clan, a terrorist<br>organization. The game relies on randomization in order to make such an uncommon genre crossover functional. As it's unfinished it contains a number of not so subtle issues, one of the three scenarios even being incompletable.<br><br>7. Vamp - Play as a vampire that walks around an incredibly small<br>town murdering men in their pajamas. You have no hostile adversaries and you can neither win nor lose.<br><br>8. Xai - Drive a car across a featureless plane dropping tacks. When the harmless scribble men pass over the tacks they die and disappear. The game has no objectives or threats to the player. At the center of the level is a large character, for which the game is named, that has no bearing on the goings on around him and exists simply to scratch himself.

Description=Gardenscapes is a hidden object game with a landscaping theme. As the sole inheritor of a mansion with a ruined garden, the player has to sell household items to raise the money necessary to refurbish the place. The sale takes place in the various rooms of the mansion, each represented by a screen showing the available items scattered over the scenery. At the left side, a clock shows the remaining time to finish the sale, with portraits of customers and their orders displayed beneath it. The objective is to find and click on all the required items before time runs out. Each patron has a patience meter, a series of hearts that start to vanish if the order takes too long to be fulfilled, making them pay less when finally receiving their objects. As in most time management games, the customers leave their payment as stacks of coins, that have to be quickly collected to make the slot available for the next patron.<br><br>The game incorporates some of the hint system ideas found on the Little Shop series, as extra items that can be collected on each location. The thermometers make all the visible portraits frosty or glowing red with heat when the cursor is far away or close to the required object. The cameras turn most of the screen white with their flash lights, with the exception of some of the requested items. ? marks can be collected for extra uses for the hint button at the bottom, that replaces the order entries with pictures of the objects. Coins can also be found concealed on each scene, to be clicked and automatically added to the funds.<br><br>The money received has to be spent on a separate screen showing a top view of a garden section, with the butler Austin roaming around it and giving advice and clues. Parts of the ruined scenery can be clicked, bringing the available purchase options. As the garden is reformed, letters and telephone calls move the plot forwards.

Description=Gardyloo Golf is a brief, top-down golf game with a number of unique twists. Due to the limitations of the engine used to power the game a stylized pixel-based art-style is used which focuses more on conveying visual information than modeling any sense of reality.<br><br>Gameplay is fairly archetypal of the sport, the overarching goal being to guide a ball around various obstacles and into a corresponding hole, repeating the action over the course of several variant levels. The player may hit the ball with an amount of force ranging from one to five, dictating the distance that it will travel. The game is, however, grid-based in nature. As such hitting the ball with some number of force will cause the ball to travel an equivalent number of spaces in the direction that it was hit. No score is kept, nor are there any opponents to compete with, thus the game is entirely non-competitive.<br><br>A clear emphasis is placed throughout the game on exploring and interacting with the environment, even over the more overt objective of golfing, despite these interactions being somewhat limited in scope. A pepper salesman also exists in a majority of the levels, allowing the player to breathe fire by consuming his notably spicy wares. While a curiosity that allows superficial aspects of the field to be altered the ability has no effect on the rest of the game.<br><br>A number of hazards exist to impede progress, such as buildings and alligators, however as the number of additional golf balls is unlimited their effects are merely temporary; the game comes to an end purely by guiding the player from course to course, there existing no way to win or lose in a traditional sense.

Description=A simulation so spare it can barely be called a game, this game puts the player in charge of a gas station, controlling three factors: whether to buy bulk gas today (at today's wholesale rate, which may fluctuate tomorrow), whether to purchase an additional gasoline storage tank, and what to set today's gasoline prices at.  The goal is to amass $30 thousand -- seemingly trivial, given that the player begins two thirds of the way there!  Ah, but then the price wars begin with the other station across the street and to remain competitive a player is driven to sell gas, temporarily, at a price below that which it was bought for.  Observing only the factors of the daily price of wholesale gas, the competitor's price yesterday, and both stations' gallons sold yesterday, the player need devise a gradual strategy to slowly but steadily turn black gold into conventional lucre.  Customers are canny, and will happily shut out a gas station entirely if its prices are too far out of line with its competition, but a price-slashing race to the bottom impoverishes both the player and the computer opponent.  Compounding things, when prices escalate at the pump, wholesale rates rise!  Real gas prices are informed by such complicated factors as geological exploration, seasonal storms, heavy industry and armed insurrection; however, often it can seem as logical as a monkey throwing a dart blindfolded.  This game simulates all that fun -- and more!

They remain engaged for the rest of their lives, occasionally mating to generate offspring. The child inherits some characteristics from the parents, like job preferences and skills. The very young can't take adult duties, but can be used to collect items like herbs, bugs and zodiac plates.

The research points can be spent on the science menu, that can be accessed using the button illustrated with a graduation cap and diploma at the bottom interface. There are six types of technologies, with three levels each. Farming allows new ways of generating food for the society, like harvesting, fishing, bee-keeping and related activities. Construction makes new building sites automatically appear on the locations, from where the builders can erect useful structures like new houses to increase the population limit, and buildings to process resources. Medicine expands the life expectancy and birthrate of the community, and adds new potions to the laboratory. Handicraft makes new tools available to be built, their cost being a combination of resources. Knowledge makes scientists more efficient and gives linguistic skills to talk with specific characters. Astrology gives access to any structure related to the teleporter and other esoteric sites.<br><br>Like in other similar titles, when starting the game reads the computer clock to calculate the time elapsed between gaming sessions, readjusting the situation as if the game was kept running, and the virtual people kept working away on the background.

Description=The Gemstone Warrior is part action game, part adventure game.  Players work their way through an underground catacomb, doing three things at once.  First they need to find five pieces of a gemstone, spread throughout the maze.  Second they need to avoid getting killed by the guardians of the catacomb.  Finally they need to map the game, because the place is so large that it is easy to get lost.  Once the Gemstone Warrior has collected the five gemstone pieces, he needs to move back to the point where he began the game.<br><br>The hero has to go underground because of demons.  They stole the gemstone from humans, because they were jealous of the good magic it brought to humankind.  They broke it up and spread it throughout their dungeon, to hide it.<br><br>This game is not just a shoot-em-up.  It has many of the features of that style of game, but also gives players time to think.  It includes a pause which helps one map and also to freeze a room, to see what is running toward the Gemstone Warrior.   The game also has a save feature, which is useful just before entering a new room: if the Gemstone Warrior is ambushed, players can give him another chance.<br><br>After killing opponents, the Gemstone Warrior has the opportunity to search the bodies for treasure.  Monsters carry arrows, and also "magic bolts."  The last are interesting, as they destroy treasure too, as well as the Gemstone Warrior, should he be too close to the explosion.  Magic items abound, and help the warrior make it through the caverns.  Some magic items are traps too; there is a healing potion bottle that is similar to a poison bottle.  Other magic items include effects to freeze opponents, turn the warrior invisible, hide him among monsters with an illusion, annihilate all opponents in the current cavern, and cure disease.

In other instances the viewer finds a complete object, and the player has to find and click on its scattered pieces on the scenery.<br><br>The inventory is accessible at the bottom of the screen, and the stored objects have to be dragged and dropped from it to logical places of the scenery. A key, for example, can be used on a lock to open it. Fairies can also be found amongst the hidden items, giving extra hints when collected.

Each species various in the way they play the game and have vastly different types of attacks available to them.<br><br>Giants is a action/real-time-strategy game that emphasizes action. While there is base-building and resource management for most of the races, it is a done through a simple to control interface and one or two keystrokes. The majority of the game will be spent in a third person view (first person mode is available) jet-packing/warping/leaping about the well rendered 3D landscape. Single player sessions consist of missions with specific goals, such as resucing Smarties or recovering lost items. Multiplayer options include standard deathmatch, capture the Smartie (flag), the above with basebuilding as an option.<br><br>Other creatures also inhabit the islands. From the meek Smarties (who are employed to build your bases or eaten as a primary source of protein, depending on your species), to the cow-like vimps to the deadly rippers, the fauna of the planet will either try to kill you or avoid being killed/eaten/captured. While not so energetic, the floral of the islands can be crushed, knocked over, or burned in careless combat (or by Kabuto not paying attention). <br><br>Game controls are similar to Shiny's MDK and can best be described a simplified shooter interface. You can run, jump, turn, shoot, and strafe. Beyond that, a half-dozen keystrokes are all you need to play (and some, like Kabuto's howls, are for fun and show). <br><br>Trying to break away from the dark and moody nature of many recent games, Planet Moon made this alien world bright and full of vibrant colors. A great number of graphic options are available, most of them only will work on high-end video cards. In addition, the game tries to maintain a humorous streak. The single player game has goofy dialogue and a few jokes spread along its story line and even the multiplayer is lighthearted, with Smarties cheering you on as you carry them on your back, among other little sounds and nuances.

Pressing P makes Giddy jump, and the SPACE bar brings up the inventory (a cloud with descriptive text pops up on the screen). Q and W cycle through the collected paraphernalia, and pressing the SPACE bar makes an attempt to use the selected object. When a light bulb lights up (when Giddy walks over certain spots), pressing ENTER displays a hint about one of the puzzles.<br><br>One of the main differences of this installment compared to the previous ones is the addition of side-scrolling instead of the traditional flip-screen.

Description=Global Conflicts: Palestine is a serious game about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where you play the role of a reporter researching stories in and around Jerusalem. <br><br>The game has six different chapters, each representing one news story, and for each story you decide whether to write for an Israeli, a Palestinian, or a European newspaper. This choice, along with the many dialog choices you make during the game, influences your status with the different sides in the conflict, which again determines what sources, angles and information become available to you. <br><br>The game is set in 3D, where you navigate the city and surrounding areas to meet and interview sources. Using wit, reason and diplomacy to build trust in the journalistic interviews, your goal is to gather enough interesting statements for a front-page article. At the end of each chapter, the player assembles a story from the collected statements, and its newsworthiness and bias is calculated. <br><br>The educational goal of the game is to educate players ages 13-19 about aspects of the conflict.

Description=Following Balance of Power, designer Chris Crawford stuck to the big-picture approach but shifted the focus from power politics to macroeconomics. In a grassroots simulation of industrial production and allocation, players balance a countrys military and social spending to survive in an environment of fictitious nations competing for land and resources.<br><br>Key element in the turn-based The Global Dilemma is a basic tree of industries such as coal mines, lumber mills or gunpowder factories. The entire production chain culminates in only two results: an increase in either military strength or population. Guns or butter. <br><br>The careful balancing and channelling of the industrial production, stripped down to the most basic mechanics, is The Global Dilemmas fundamental challenge. A growing worker population is vital for the economy. A strong military is vital for conquering neighboring provinces, their resources and population. <br><br>At the same time, rivalling countries threaten the borders, and troops must be deployed to the vulnerable spots on the map. Superiority in numbers wins the abstract clashes of armies. The expert difficulty level adds a diplomacy system in which nations form short-term economic alliances.<br><br>The Global Dilemma sees Crawford refine his particular brand of socio-global simulations, reducing complex issues to basic cause-and-effects chains that have a distinctly educative edge. As usual, a well-written manual details the games mechanics. Crawford continued with Balance of the Planet (1990).

A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn, the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends: Camelot, Land's End and Fisher King. After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.<br><br>In Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole.<br><br>In the second table called Land's End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and "myst" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on "CASTLE", and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the "ERRANTRY" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically.<br><br>In the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the "LONGINUS" spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the "BEAST" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the "HOLY GRAIL" letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot.

Description=As with Jason Rohrer's previous game Passage, Gravitation is an autobiographical game and it has a similar visual style. No explanation of the goal or the game mechanics is given and just like Rob Humble's art games a large part of the appeal is in discovering the gameplay. As such, the rest of the description below can be considered a spoiler and should not be read before first playing the game.<br><br>Gravitation is played as a metaphor of how the protagonist's moods and creative endeavors affect his family and vice versa. The player controls a bitmapped character in an environment that can only be explored vertically. The only other character is a small boy, Rohrer's son Mez. A single gameplay session consists of eight minutes with a clock counting down the seconds. By climbing platforms, the player collects blue stars (prizes) that drop down to the lowest level. As soon as they hit the ground, a number appears on them, counting down from nine to one. To collect the points, the blocks need to be pushed into a fireplace, but if the player stacks too many before coming back down, it becomes hard to move them around. Collecting the stars is not a goal by itself, the player can choose to play with Mez all the time and not achieve anything else, or go for the stars with the chance of having Mez disappear.<br><br>Mez is on the lowest level and he throws a ball the protagonist can return. This clears up the sky (and the character's mind) and allows the main character to jump and reach higher areas. At the same time, the frame size grows. When staying up the higher levels too long, Mez will disappear, leaving behind the red ball, most likely as an affirmation of the player's greed or neglect. It is not possible to collect all stars at once, grab all of them, or reach the top of the level. After a while, the frame size shrinks again, the environment turns cold and the main character can barely jump. This can be restored by returning to the lowest level, pushing stars into the fire or by playing with Mez. The entire sky also clears up when flames come out of the player's head, possibly referring to a manic or mad state, providing a short burst of motivation before eventually returning to depression.

Description=Green Moon is a traditional first-person, point-and-click adventure game following the standards of Myst and other classics of the genre, but with simpler puzzles aimed at the casual market. The player assumes the role of the sole inheritor of an abandoned house, a place containing a spell book left by ancient magicians. The tome has clear instructions about what tasks have to be accomplished, and can be accessed at any time from the top-right corner of the screen. The objects found on each room have to be dragged and dropped on the inventory slots at the bottom, from where they can be used on parts of the scenery or combined with other items to perform an action or complete a task. The inventory space is limited, but it is possible to left objects on most scenes and pick them up again later.<br><br>The cursor is context-sensitive, changing from the default pointing finger to a grabbing hand when over one of the objects, morphing into a magnifying glass when hovering over a part of the scenery with a zoom view, and transforming into walking shoes when near one of the exit spots. The player moves between rooms by clicking on the exit hotspots, usually positioned over obvious places like doors and other openings, or by pressing one of the four interface arrows surrounding the central image. The main character can wear clothes and consume food and beverages by selecting an item with the left button, and pressing the right button.<br><br>The locations have hints written on pieces of paper, or visual clues on various photographs and other notes scattered around the scenery. As the tasks are gradually completed on the spell book, new types of magic become available at the bottom-right generator, allowing time-travel, teleportation, healing, invisibility and other special abilities. Later in the game, the navigator becomes available at the bottom-left to explore the moon, showing a top view of the lunar landscape peppered with several travel locations and other reference points.

Description=Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is considered an expansion of Guitar Hero III and it is the first title in the series primarily focused on a single band. The gameplay concept is similar to the game it is based on. About 60% of the included tracks are by Aerosmith, while the others have influenced or have opened for the band (Run-D.M.C., The Kings, Lenny Kravitz, ...).

The majority of the tracks consists of master recordings.<br><br>The prominent game segment is the career mode where players go through the band's history, from the earlier seventies to 2001. Times of internal issues are not touched upon. Players initially start as Joe Perry but can later also unlock the other band members Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton. The career has been divided into six tiers with five tracks, each based on a period in the band's history. There are also encores when a tier has been completed, and two opening acts playing as another band. After each tier, bonus material is shown such as trivia or video sequences and interviews.<br><br>Songs are unlocked gradually and become available in the other modes, identical to Guitar Hero III (Quickplay, Cooperative, Competitive + Battle modes). Only the cooperative career mode is absent. The menus have been redesigned and there are new venues, based on historical performances. There are 41 songs in total, of which 31 can be unlocked in the career mode and an additional 10 in the vault.<br><br>The game is available in a bundle with a custom guitar or as a single game release.

Description=Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the third full game in the Guitar Hero series and fourth game overall. The gameplay remains similar to the previous games: using a guitar-shaped controller, you need to coordinate pressing the five fret buttons and strumming to the scrolling notes on screen. Missing notes will cause your performance meter to drop; if the meter drops too low then the performance is a failure and you will need to try again. This edition of the game features 71 new songs to play from various artists including Cream, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Santana, Sonic Youth, Weezer, and many more. In addition to the available songs the game also features &quot;boss battles&quot; against famous guitarists such as Slash, Tom Morello and Lou the Devil. Several game modes are available including career mode, co-op mode, and multiplayer mode. In addition to the main game modes, training and practice modes are available to aid in learning the game or figuring out a tricky passage in a song.<br><br>In career mode you play the part of a wanna-be rock star. Beginning with easier songs in small venues, you need to successfully complete tracks to make your way up to a superstar. Each venue you play requires a certain number of songs to be performed before you can move on to the next larger venue. Successful completion of songs also earns money which can be used to unlock characters, outfits, new guitars, and other bonuses.<br><br>The co-op career mode is similar to the single player variation, except two players work together (one on lead guitar, the other on bass or rhythm guitar) to complete songs. <br><br>The multiplayer game modes allow two players to compete against each other. In the Face-Off variation, two players take turns performing a song. The Pro Face-Off variation allows two players to compete at the same time playing the exact same note chart. Finally, in the battle mode each player can earn power ups by performing well which can be used to disrupt the other player.

Description=Guitar Hero: World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.<br><br>While playing, a rock meter keeps track of successive notes hit (one for each player), which leads to score multipliers. When the meter becomes too low, other players can make up for this on a shared, general performance meter. In the same vein players share a star power meter, built up by playing through certain sections successfully, that any player can access.<br><br>There are four difficulty levels and a new beginner mode where notes are made as easy as possible to introduce the concept to new players. Most of the game content is centered around a Career mode (both Solo and Band) where players start a new band, choose an avatar an instrument, and then play different gigs unlocking new songs along the way. Completing tracks earns money that can be spent on outfits or instruments. There are once again encore songs and "boss challenges" where the lead guitar enters a duel. This is similar to the battles in Guitar Hero III, but without the power-ups. Instead it returns to a call-and-response mechanic similar to the Face-Off mode. Bands consists of offline players but online members can join as well. Complete bands can take on others online through the Battle of the Bands mode.<br><br>Through the Music Studio editor new songs can be composed and shared using the GHTunes service (not for the PS2). In this edition avatars can be customized with more detail using the Create-a-Rocker mode. Major artists have licensed their appearance in the game. The Wii version contains a Mii Freestyle mode where players can use their Mii characters in-game and compose songs through motions of the Wii remote and the Nunchuk controller.<br><br>There are several bundles for the game, based on the amount of instruments included, but also a stand-alone version as most of the versions are compatible with the controllers of previous games and even some of Rock Band.

You awaken a number of years after the original game on a train to City 17, an Eastern European city which is reminiscent of the World War II ghettos. And the people kept in City 17 are the remains of humanity, left at the will of the Combine, a mysterious alien group who retains totalitarian control of Earth.<br><br>You are soon brought into a resistance group, and make an attempt to bring down the Combine and liberate Earth. Why you? You saved it the last time. Or did you?<br><br>The player guides Gordon through the City 17 and the wilderness that surrounds it. On his way, he'll encounter a lot of friendly characters, but also fight dangerous foes and solve puzzles to progress. As Half-Life 2 features a realistic physics system, Gordon can pick up objects and toss them freely, and many of the puzzles are physics-based - for example, at one point the player has to weigh down a seesaw with bricks at one end to turn it into a ramp. <br><br>Gordon's enemies, apart from alien wildlife which found its way to Earth, are mainly Combine forces, which utilize a variety of firearms, gadgets and vehicles. Policemen and foot soldiers work along with helicopters, gunships and gigantic walking machines to hunt you down. To defend himself, Gordon has a range of weapons available: from the iconic crowbar for close-quarter fighting, through pistols and rifles, up to grenades and a rocket launcher. Most notable weapon is the "gravity gun", with which one can pick up objects, hold them in the gun's antigravity field, then hurl them at the enemy with great force. <br><br>Also with Half-Life 2 is Counter-Strike: Source, a version of Counter-Strike made with the new Source engine which powers Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, an online multiplayer game featuring the same physics and weapons as the single player game.

The great unanswered question of "How could Alyx have survived that explosion" is answered, as are the fates of many of the other supporting characters from Half-Life 2.<br><br>Episode One is the first of what has been promised will be a three episode trilogy which, when completed, could be considered Half-Life 3.  Since it follows the episodic format, it has only four to six hours of gameplay.  One feature which extends overall game life, however, is the inclusion of a "Commentary" mode, which enables hotspots on each map where the player can listen to developer commentary explaining how or why certain things were done.<br><br>Players of Half-Life 2 will find the gameplay very familiar.  No new weapons were added to Episode One, although all the weapons from Half-Life 2 have been carried over.  Enemies, too are familiar, with only one new enemy, a new zombie variant.  The most intriguing new gameplay element is the behavior of Alyx, who fights along Gordon's side for virtually the entire game.

You hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol make a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.<br><br>Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.<br><br>Only two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on back-up.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.<br><br>Your life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item than is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.<br><br>One of most significant features is vehicles.

Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.<br><br>Halo also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types.

Description=Harpooned, the Japanese cetacean research simulator, is a satirical game where players control a research vessel to do scientific investigation on whales. This is just a cover however, as the game carries an environmental message and aims to capture the hypocrisy of the Japanese whaling program. Shown from a top-down perspective using vertically-scrolling gameplay, players shoot whales with harpoons for points and collect the meat. Killing multiple whales in a row leads to ultra-scientific bonuses. At the end of each phase, the meat is loaded onto a larger research vessel for "further study", showing how it is processed into cat food and whale burgers.<br><br>The player needs to avoid icebergs, while steering away of protesters' ships, helicopters and other vessels that try to get in the way. Sinking them leads to legal fees. The ship can also be damaged, mainly through the icebergs. The gameplay is interspersed with sarcastic messages:<br>Whale numbers seem to be decreasing in this region.<br>We must kill more whales to determine the cause of the decrease.<br>An update (as well as the first Macintosh version) was released in January 2009. It adds the ability to capture protesters and kidnap them when they get too close to the research vessel and there are also online leaderboards to compete for the rank of top scientist with other players from all over the world.

If the player does not want to walk and search around, they have two ways to cut a corner: portraits, which are unlocked during the course of the game, can be used to teleport instantly to another place. Harry can also call a ghost which shows him the fastest way to the next mission. Exploration has mostly one goal: finding the 150 (more or less) hidden crests which unlock achievements and trophies. Because Harry lost his ability to jump and climb, he has to use spells to reach them.<br><br>Mini Games<br>The player will spend most of his time in three mini games: magic duels, brewing potions, and quidditch. The duels are used to learn new spells respectively improve the already known. Harry basically faces other magicians and uses his spells to defeat them, e.g. by paralyzing them or by parrying their spells. To perform a spell the player has to use his input device to recreate a certain movement.<br><br>Quidditch is a reaction test. Harry's broom flies automatically and the player can only slightly move it to fly through rings or avoid obstacles. While brewing potions Harry faces a bowl, ingredients and a time limit. Now he simply needs to recreate the receipt by using the ingredients in the correct on the bowl. Sometimes he needs to heat up the bowl or stir the brew up with his input device. If he makes a mistake there is smoke which costs time.

You are marked with a God Symbol (a mark some people have from birth that marks them as possibly able to become a mage) and are a female Inquisitor mage.  You were sent to destroy the GodSlayer sword, but when you arrive, it has been stolen.  So begins your main quest... to capture and destroy the sword.<br><br>The game is a typical isometric RPG, but with many features not seen in other games of this genre.  Every equipable item has an attunement.  If you use the item long enough, you will learn that attunement.  Attunements can be magical abilities, or skills.  In order to learn all the attunements, you will need to use all the items you find.  This makes it important to actually use everything you find rather than sticking to a single weapon/armor combination.<br><br>Your character has a limited number of attunement slots that can be active at one time.  As you gain levels, this number will increase somewhat.  It will be up to you to decide what attunements you want to have active at any one time.  For example, if you plan to use a Fire-imbued sword, you will want to use an attunement to add fire damage to your sword.  Having an active attunement to add lightning damage (air magic) to your weapon will not help as the magic types are different.<br><br>One of the most important features of the game is the Dreamworld.  This alternate world can only be accessed for short periods of time (unless you are using the Dreamform attunement).  In this world, you will find bonuses that will help your stats, as well as dangers.  Ghosts are found in this world, as are werewolves and other creatures.  Most creatures and people can only be seen in either the real world or the dreamworld, and not both.  This can make switching between the worlds a way to escape danger.<br><br>As you gain experience, you will want to improve your main skills (melee, range attack, magic, etc).  These skills start out at an F (think school grades), and can be improved from there for every 100 improvement points.  You will have the opportunity to improve 800 points worth when you create your character.<br><br>One final unique feature to mention is that healing items never disappear.  However, you will lose maximum HP every time you use them.  The maximum HP will remain lost until you rest at a campfire, inn, or your house (if you bought it).<br><br>Expect your actions to have consequences as the game reacts to your actions.  Choose the path of good or evil and expect to have different reactions from others.  Your path will determine the ending to the game, from 6 different endings.<br><br>The gameplay is similar to other games of this genre.  You will need to explore the world around you, talk to NPCs, improve your stats and skills, and battle enemies in real time.

Description=Hind is a simulation of the Soviet Mi-24 helicopter (codenamed "Hind" by NATO and nicknamed "Flying Tank" by Soviet troops), and the followup to Apache. It features the most of the same options, including the ability to change between realistic or more arcade-ish controls by reducing roll, adding unlimited ammo or make the Hind indestructible. Gameplay was changed to fit the differences between the fast and maneuverable Apache and the slow and rock-solid Hind - Instead of relying on speed, Hind pilots must be prepared to take all openings possible to attack and focus on avoiding missile fire (as the hull can take machine gun and even cannon rounds happily). Several viewpoints are available, from pilot or gunner to several external views.<br><br>There are three campaigns, Kazakhstan (where you face a similarly-equipped enemy, pro-independence rebels), Afghanistan (the Mujaheddin, mostly foot soldiers armed with machine guns, rockets and the odd AAA but in a very hilly terrain) and Korea, where you can skirmish against American equipment. Campaign missions range from fixed target destruction (such as a bunker or a fuel depot), troop deployment (or evacuation), attack enemy positions or even lasing a target for the MiGs. There are day, night and foggy missions, where you have to rely just on instruments for navigation, making pre-mission planning (you can edit the flight plan to include more waypoints, or move them to go round or over a mountain, for instance) more important. <br><br>Each campaign include 10 scenarios that can be played by their own, along several training missions (which are crucial to get the most of the helicopter). Netplay is included, and given the similarities between Hind and Apache, owners of each game can go head to head together.

Patients have heart gauges over them, indicating their health/patience. If all hearts expire, the patients leave the hospital. Installing decorative upgrades will hamper their heart decrease rate, like plants, television, water dispensers, or food stations. Like in real life, some people reach their limits quicker than others, so you'll have to be vigilant. If a patient is running low on health, his/her face pops up in the corner of the screen as a warning.<br><br>To begin a treatment, take the patient to the diagnostics counter (click, drag and drop). Once diagnosed, the patient will sport a balloon indicating the next treatment in order, above them. This means utilizing more medical stations. There is also the need to bring the patient's chart to the respective treatment station before treatment can begin. All treatments take time, and some require additional actions, like making up beds, or providing medication.<br><br>After a while, treatment stations will break down and require repairs, which can be done by using the wrench available on the main counter. An original addition, is the ability to send patients to other medical centers by putting them into an ambulance parked outside, when unable to treat them.<br><br>At the beginning of each level, you enter the workshop, where you buy, sell, and position equipment, thus customizing your workplace. In the expenses tab, you can adjust the amount of funds invested in special costs like salaries. Increasing salaries speeds up doctors (of course), and increasing pharmacy costs speeds up delivery of prescriptions and charts. The coffee bar increases the coffee power up availability, which speeds your action. Increasing the maintenance bar decreases the chance of apparel break downs. You can also change the color of your work attire, which has no purpose but to look different.

Description=Hush is a short sociopolitical game inspired by the Rwandan Genocide in 1994, the darkest period of the Rwandan Civil War. It was created by two MFA students from the University of Southern California Interactive Media Division, for their fall 2007 Intermediate Game Design and Development course. Unlike the broad strategy setting of Darfur is Dying by a student from the same course, Hush has the player relive the historical events through a personal experience - helping the Tutsi mother Liliane with her lullaby to keep her child silent and thus hide it from the Hutu.<br><br>Liliane is prominently shown on the right side of the screen. The story is told through a view through a window on the left side, along with music and sound detailing the events. The player needs to type in the letters of words spelled out on the screen (hush, brave, child, sleep, young, rest, ...), in a timely fashion - when they light up bright. This will keep the lullaby in tune and the baby will grow silent. Pressing the keys too early or too late will grow the baby restless and a soldier patrolling outside will draw closer. Successful matches, with a response time much longer than similar games, will keep the story going. When the crying becomes too loud and soldier gets too close, the entire screen fades to red and a gunshot is heard.<br><br>As a game, it is best described as an aesthetic, visual and auditory experience, or a vignette - a brief and subtle description to give a trenchant impression about the character and the situation.

Tiles with shattered ice can only support the slab if it stands up, otherwise they break. The slab can stand or lay on tiles with tricky snow, but when standing on them they turn into shattered ice ones. Thin ice tiles can only be crossed once. Some tiles have switches that activate bridges when the slab stands or lays on them.<br><br>Between the levels the witch challenges the player to a mini-game, where each opponent must push pucks (that slide like in table hockey) off the table.

The Iggles come in four colours and need to be delivered at the transportation point with the corresponding colour. The colour of the trail can be in any order, but identically coloured Iggles forming a single line provide more points, leading to combos. The enemy Zoogs come in different flavours and try to trap the player's character. Some simply walk around, while others have fixed patterns or shoot bubbles. When they touch the trail, it is cut off, sending the Iggles loose or trapping them again. To complete a level, the player has to free all Iggles.<br><br>New techniques and features are introduced gradually through short tutorial sessions with doctor Iggle between the missions. The main Iggle can collect letters to earn extra lives, walk with the correct number of Iggles in the trail through a chain bonus pad to unlock diamonds, walk into a pad to sort the colours, freeze enemies, shortly activate electricity to hunt the Zoogs, and more. He can also get a short burst of speed, but this needs to be recharged.

Whenever battle is initiated with an opponent, however, the option is given to the player either to have the battle be automated by the computer or controlled directly by themselves. If the player chooses the latter then they must arrange and direct their army against the opponent in a real-time battle on a self-contained battlefield relevant to that sector of the world. This applies equally to naval combat.<br><br>Diplomacy is also a key aspect, allowing you to make defensive treaties with other countries, form a coalition against an unfriendly nation, and improve foreign relations, among other options. Commercial routes can also be established with other countries, providing you with the finances either to form a wealthy, commercial entity or establish a militaristic empire.<br><br>The game has two main gameplay options, each with its own specific set of objectives. The first, Score Victory, requires that the player gain more points than any of his opponents to win, collecting them through military operations, economic success, and diplomatic achievements. The second, Total Victory, is much simpler, tasking the player with conquering Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa in order to win. An option also exists to play one of four historic battles of the period as a brief, real-time scenario.

Description=Incoming aliens! Incoming aliens! They've already attacked the international moonbase, and they may already have a base in the Arctic! Earth is building a huge tracking station as first part of the counterattack, but now you detect incoming aliens and they don't look friendly! Defend your base against the initial incursion by manning turret, tank, helicopter, harrier jet, and even captured alien fighter as you battle the aliens in various continents, and eventually lead the counterattack on the moon! <br><br>Incoming is a 3D shooter with plenty of action. In arcade mode, you can play it as a straight shooter. Some missions have you manning an immobile turret where you simply aim at the sky and engage incoming bogeys. Other missions can have you control a ground hovertank engaging enemy ground threats. Yet other missions will have you control a helicopter, a Harrier jumpjet, and even a captured alien fighter. There are also an "action" mode and "action-tactics" mode, where you are given some limited control of other friendly units.

Description=This game involves puzzle solving, while creating wacky machines.  Each level of the game contains a machine designed to do a specific task.  The only problem is, there are parts missing, and it is your job to figure out where to put what in order to get the machine to work.  The game features many wacky machine parts, including cats, super balls, lava lamps, flashlights, can openers, monkeys on treadmills, and many more wacky parts to get your machine working.  The game also comes with an editor to let you design your own unique machines from scratch.  These can either be for fun, or you can set it so that the person playing has to fill in the missing parts, just like in the campaign.

Although the people living in the town of Lucasio are friendly, others such as Nazis, desperados and dangerous creatures are not so much. Indiana must use his skills to accomplish his objectives and retreive treasured objects.<br><br>Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures is an action/adventure game, seen in top-down view. Players control Indiana Jones as he collects items, attempts to solve all the puzzles and defeat his enemies in order to complete the mission. Indiana primarily uses his whip, but may also pick up a pistol or other weapons to use against foes. Indiana has a health meter on screen and will die if it drops to zero.<br><br>The design of Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures is meant to be "casual gaming" and is simplified to give the player quick experiences. Upon beginning a game, the player chooses the size of the game world (and indirectly the length of time it will take to complete). The game world, all the characters, items and Indiana's mission are then randomly generated. Individual locations, such as the town of Lucasio may remain the same, however the path to and from those areas may change considerably.

Description=Released by Scholastic in the Fall of 1999, I Spy Junior is the 3rd game in the I Spy series, following on the heels of the original edition of I Spy Spooky Mansion and intended for a younger market of 3 to 5 year-olds. All of the games in the series are based on books written and photographed by Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick.<br><br>This I Spy game diverges from the pattern set by previous ones by offering more than find-hidden-object puzzles - you will also find Oops Hoops, where you sort items into hoops containing similar things. Some hoops intersect, or require you to sort by three definitions instead of two, and the puzzles become a little more difficult as you finish each set. In Pattern Place, you must complete patterns by dragging and releasing objects - each pattern is accompanied by an auditory pattern as well. You are encouraged to express your creativity in the Make Your Own I Spy section - you are given a blank screen with a scrollable bin full of objects beneath it, a choice of backgrounds, and a few tools: an eraser and open, save, and print buttons. <br><br>Each window is accompanied on the left by four icons, for the Main Menu, Help, Exit, and Back (If applicable). You also have an arrow on the bottom right to go forward, and an ear icon in the bottom window that will replay the spoken riddle if you want to hear it again. If you allow a puzzle to sit for a while, you'll hear a gentle spoken suggestion: "If you need help, click the question mark"!<br><br>This I Spy game is primarily meant for the preschooler, with puzzles designed for early childhood development and focusing on logical thinking skills, creativity, early math and reading.

Description=The basic idea here comes from Bejeweled / Diamond Mine - you are presented with a grid of blocks. Forming rows of three is done by swapping pairs of tiles which are next to each other, and the rows of 3 disappear, with other blocks falling Tetris-style to take their place.<br><br>Jewel Match has its own victory criterion though. On each level, a selection of squares have gold backings. Matches must be created over each of these to clear the level.<br><br>The level layouts are not simple 8x8 squares in this implementation; instead they can be as big as 14x14 and have gaps and shaped areas, so pieces do not simply fall vertically but also can fall diagonally.<br><br>On later levels other features make things harder. Silver squares hide gold ones, so they represent squares which need to be part of a match twice. Some squares are fitted with locks - these can't be moved until a match is made using them; often there are empty spaces below these, which are only made available after a lock is 'picked'.<br><br>A succession of hammers are unlocked once you have scored a certain amount of points. The first removes a particular block, the second not only removes the block but also any effects (gold or silver) on the square, and the final one removes all tiles of that colour.

Using your mouse, swap two jewels so there is a row of three or more of the same. You must make swaps over the gold tiles. When all the gold tiles are clear, you then make swaps to make a medallion get to the bottom of the puzzle. This will then clear the level. After you clear the level, you will have the opportunity to upgrade your castle, if you have enough jewels.  You also can collect coins in the puzzles. These can be used to purchase things in the shop, like spells. One such is the fire spell. When used, it destroys jewels seven cells wide by seven cells high, in a plus sign shape. After making enough matches, you can power up the hammer. This can be powered to different levels, depending on how long you go. At it's lowest, it will destroy one jewel. At it's highest, it will destroy one jewel, the gold or silver plate it is on, if any, and all the others of the same color.<br><br>In later levels, you will encounter boxes. These are destroyed by simply making a match next to them. You will also find silver plates. These must have a match made over them to turn them gold. Some jewels will be locked.

Description=In the past, the protagonist was on a treasure hunt for the fabled Tonatiuh, The Temple of the Fifth Sun. To reach the location, he had to conquer portals by realigning relics according to an ancient description. He wrote his progress into his Jewel Quest Journal.<br><br>Today, while arranging manuscripts for the university, he stumbled across his old journey and now he wants to try it again. Or better say, you will try it again.<br><br>Each level represents one dot on the treasure map, leading from the airplane take down point to the location of the temple. You have to play all levels to reach the treasure. However, you have the opportunity to skip a level, if it is to difficult, but you loose one life (out of five) when you do so.<br><br>Your job in a level is to do exactly what the ancient script tells you, "Align the relics you can see, across or down in groups of three. Turn all squares to solid gold, the path to riches will soon unfold.".<br><br>So, for example, at the start of level 1-1 (first level in the first group), you have a 7x7 playfield, each block is filled with one of four different items (relics). Now you have to exchange adjacent items so, that a line of three or up to five items will be created (more than five are possible, but you can't do this manually). You cannot exchange items when no full line is possible, so creating a line from scratch is not possible. Those items will vanish and the ground will change from beige to gold, the spaces will fill with the items from above, and new items are falling in from the top of the playfield. Once all blocks are gold, you have completed the level. When the time runs out, you have lost a life.<br><br>While the level progress, you will have either bigger playfields or more complex ones. Complex means that they are not always in square or rectangle form, but, for example, they can also have a zigzag side, where either horizontal or vertical alignments aren't possible. Of course, the farther you go, the more relics are in the playfield, and also the time will be shorter.

To exit the level, a blue sign needs to be touched. There is an unlimited amount of tries per level and progress is saved automatically.<br><br>Next to the main game there is also a playground to toy around, and a full level editor.

Description=Jump Raven is the second title released by Cyberflix. The game is set in New York in an undefined period in the 21st century. All wildlife appears to be extinct as man has scorched the entire earth with war. Before it was too late, all animals' genetic code has been stored in biodiversity pods to bring them back safely when the ecosystem has recovered. However, a gang steals the pods and the Environmental Security Agency (ESA) brings in bounty hunter Raven to return them and preserve the animals' future.<br><br>Building on the technology of Lunicus, in Jump Raven the character Raven uses a hovercraft to move around the city. The game starts in a command center where the player can read up on the events that led to the global disaster, outfit the vehicle with different types of weapons, and interview candidates for the position of co-pilot in the hovercraft (Nikki, Chablis, Limbaugh, Thrash, Lark or Dogstar). Their in-game comments bring a different atmosphere to the gameplay.<br><br>While flying, there are three boroughs to search for pods: The Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The hovercraft can be moved around, it can switch between a hover and a fly mode, and players need to aim and fire weapons. As that is too much for the player to handle, tasks can be delegated to the AI co-pilot. When the pods have been found, a boss character guarding the exit needs to be taken out.<br><br>While playing, the game area takes up only half of the screen. The rest is reserved for incoming video messages (including taunting opponents), general options, weapon selection, a radar, a compass, and basic statistics about ammo, fuel, shields, the pods and cash. While searching the cities, targets such as jets, sleds, helicopters, tanks and armoured cars need to be engaged. When low on fuel, shield power or weapons, the fuel truck, weapons lady (in a helicopter) and the repair bay can be visited.

When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared!  Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears.  He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it.  Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides.  Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.<br><br>King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface.  Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands.  To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag.  By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area.  Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at".  The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects.  The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too).  Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors.  Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag.  By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has.  In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.<br><br>As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die.  Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise.  The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.

After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.<br><br>For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him.

There are fifteen stages in total, including the already mentioned plus Dunedin, Queenstown, Mount Cook, Punakaiki, Kaikoura, Taniwha, Cook Strait, Taranaki, Taupo, Mount Ruapehu, Waimoto Caves and Tokoroa. At each stage, Nik has to search for his abducted friends in a platform perspective, with the help of a minimap this time. They are caged and Nik has to find them, while using a crossbow and arrows to defeat creatures such as snails, pukekos, hedgehogs, sheep, bats, kiwifruit monsters, sharks and stingrays. Some creatures ride flying vehicles, and as in the previous game, Nik can fly them if killing the enemies without destroying the vehicle. The vehicles available are the balloon, the airplane (faster horizontally, used by pukekos) and the helicopter (faster vertically, used by sheep). Sheep also drop SPNKR (Sheep Powered Nuclear Killer Rocket) Rocket Launchers, which can be equipped by Nik, lasting until the end of the stage.<br><br>After defeated, the creatures drop characteristic New Zealand items such as greenstones, buzzy bees, L&P bottles, rugby balls, tomato sauce bottles, jandals and Lord of the Rings Oscars. Collecting 50 of those grant the player an extra life. Also scattered along the stages are letters. Spelling AOTEAROA (New Zealand's Maori name) grants an extra life and a short period of invincibility. The game also has more New Zealand references, as Tui Billboards and AA Road Signs.<br><br>Some levels are bonus ones, in which Kit has to try to stay alive for 60 seconds while creatures keep coming at him at a fast pace.

Description=KrissX is a crosswords puzzle game, where the player has to unscramble lines and columns of crossed letter tiles to reassemble words. In the main quest mode, tutorials appear every time that a new gameplay variation is introduced. When hovering the cursor over one of the words, a short hint is displayed inside a thought balloon, usually showing a synonym. This behavior can be turned off for extra challenge.<br><br>Various bonus tokens fall from the tiles after completing the words, activating several special powers that help solving the puzzle. Score tokens give extra points, tip tokens recharge the hint button at the bottom-right, freeze tokens lock correct letters in place, time tokens give extra seconds in Time Attack Mode and cascade tokens automatically swap letters on all the incomplete words. Some words are on fire, and if the player manages to reassemble them while they are ablaze, all the lines and columns connected to it receive a letter swap.<br><br>Three new features are unlocked while playing the quest mode. In the Time Attack Mode, the goal is to unscramble the words as fast as possible before time runs out. Time tokens drop from the finished words, adding ten seconds to the remaining time when collected. The special puzzles are groups of crosswords with words corresponding to a specific theme, like "countries of the world" and other trivia items. With the puzzle creator, the player can build custom levels that can be shared via e-mail, or posted on-line.

Description=Described by the developer as a "third-chick shooter", Kumoon is a freeware puzzle game with 3D graphics made for the 2005 edition of Assembly, a coding competition in Finland, where it won the first prize. The player controls a small chick holding a gun, using the traditional WSDA keys for movement and the mouse for aiming. There are three weapons available: a revolver, a shotgun and a grenade launcher, each with different characteristics and bullets of variable mass.<br><br>Being a physics-based game at its core, the main objective is to knock down piles of red and green boxes while keeping a score of zero or more to finish each level. After the first free shot with any of the weapons, the next discharges incur point penalties that lower the score. This must be remedied by tumbling the cubes to raise it back to above or equal to zero. The score is also subtracted if the chick touches any of the red/green boxes.<br><br>The way to solve most levels is to bounce the bullets from the walls or the ceiling to increase the points received when they finally bump into the cubes. The points are multiplied by each bounce before the projectiles hit the target boxes. The mass of each bullet is an important factor, with the revolver shooting a compact sphere that knocks down most piles, the shotgun spraying lots of small pebbles and the grenade launcher exploding a shower of projectiles on all directions.

Instead of fighting mainly in the dark, most content of the five campaigns takes place both out in the open and in daylight. This also plays into the hands of a new feature: weather effects. The second part of the third campaign is even completely build around the theme of a heavy storm hitting a small town on the outskirts.<br><br>Heavy rain is not the only new enemy for the survivors. The zombie horde also grew through the addition of three new special infected called Charger (a smaller version of the tank), Jockey (he jumps onto a team mate and moves him away from the group), Spitter (spits deadly acid in front of the player's feet) and a new class of common infected: the uncommon common infected. They have the same basic attributes as normal zombies but have a special ability. The clown for example attracts a horde of zombies, while the riot police man is immune to damage from the front.<br><br>To take on new and old enemies the weaponry has been greatly expanded. Besides new rifles, pistols and shotguns, melee weapons such a a chainsaw, a guitar and a baseball bat have been introduced to the game. Also new is a laser sight that can be used to increase the accuracy of a weapon as well as two types of special ammunition. In addition the Boomer Bile is now available to launch at enemies and turn the raging horde against them.<br><br>Multiplayer once again consists of several different modes. Besides playing through the campaigns cooperatively and playing both the survivors and special infected in the Versus mode, the players can play choose the Survival, Scavenge and Realism Mode. Survival pits the players against wave after wave of enemies with the only goal being to survive as long as possible. Scavenge requires the players to collect fuel canisters to fill up a generator while the other team, playing as special infected, tries to stop them. Realism Mode is a variation of coop-play for hardcore zombieslayers. The stakes are much higher there. The zombies can only be killed with a headshot, the witch has changed into a one-hit-one-kill-weapon, and a downed player is dead unless he is revived with the shock paddles.

But at least you're alive, and with a full bag of tricks. Take a few neccessary things from the nearby garbage, and visit Kyrandia again. Have fun!

Description=Continuing the tradition of adapting known franchises such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones with visuals based on LEGO, this game takes on the Batman universe. The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth. <br><br>It is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles.<br><br>Both characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode.<br><br>In the second part of the game players take control of the different villains such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush, Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though they can die, they immediately respawn.<br><br>Multi player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions allow drop in/drop out co-op. The PSP release fares worst of all and does not contain any kind of multiplayer option.

Description=Little Caesars Fractions Pizza is an educational designed game to teach children about fractions using pizza (Little Caesars pizza) due to pizza's inherent fractional properties. The learning action begins in a futuristic, time-traveling pizza delivery operation run by dinosaurs. You are hired after a brief screening process that includes identifying which pizza out of a selection represents a particular fraction. From there, you can elect to deliver pizza to one of four time periods: Dukedom, Amazing Mozart, Triassic Park, and Studio 50. Each time period corresponds to a different song, lesson and minigame dealing with fractions. For example, in the Triassic Park period, you must use a sling shot to hit all of the creatures carrying a fraction that fits a certain specification, i.e., greater than or less than a particular fraction. <br><br>You earn tip money by successfully completing these minigames (not necessarily for delivering the pizza). These tip coins can be used in a fractions-themed Nibbles-type arcade called Tails game back in the restaurant.

Well, the inevitable happens - he crashes into a tree, scattering tricycle parts everywhere!  Even though he'd like to blame it on the tree, deep down he knows it's all his fault. Being a little worried about consequences, however, he needs help deciding whether or not he should lie to Eddy Bear. After all, Eddy's going to be really  mad...<br><br>Thus begins the first of several such decisions the player must help Little Raven make in this game; weighing questions about whether to help out a friend even though he's &quot;too busy&quot;, whether to stop and refill a bug jar he knocked over, whether to share his cookies, even though that means there will be less for him, and others. The player is asked to make a yes or no choice in each instance, and if he makes a &quot;bad&quot; one, Little Raven is sent immediately to the Time-Out Cave - a hollowed out tree where he must sit and reconsider the choices. A good decision at this point will bring him right back into the game.<br><br>The player's goal now is to collect all the parts to Eddy Bear's tricycle by visiting Raven's friends, some of whom are not entirely willing to give up their precious finds and will require some form of assistance or encouragement by way of mini-games:<br><br>1. Shell Game - in order to win the horn back from Mole the player must correctly find the shell without the cookie underneath it.<br><br>2. Weights - The player must drag and drop parts to make weights for Wild Boar, so he'll give up the tricycle wheels he's currently using.<br><br>3. Beetles - Rabbit is willing to give up the seat he's about to make into a skateboard, but first the player has to round up a jarful of beetles Little Raven has knocked over.<br><br>4. Glasses - The player must pick Owl's glasses out of a heap of like-patterned things, then drag them over a blurry window to see the tricycle pedals.<br><br>5. Memory Game - Badger will help find the handlebars if Little Raven will explain how to play concentration; the player demonstrates.<br><br>6. Flag - Sheep will give up the foxtail decoration if the player finds him a very specific flag to replace it.<br><br>7. Cheese - Mouse has the tail lights, and will turn them over in exchange for some help pushing a big chunk of cheese into his larder.<br><br>Actions are performed with the mouse - point, click, and drag. In some games the cursor becomes a grasping paw - to collect beetles and to make the weights. The cheese-pushing game is played using the four arrow keys to move the miniature Raven.<br><br>When all the parts are collected and the tricycle reassembled, there is a final racing game where the player can speed up or slow down using the mouse buttons, as well as move side to side to avoid bushes.<br> <br>This game is suggested for 3 years old and up - the questions it poses are universal, dealing with honesty, generosity, consequences and peer relations.

The main objective is to carry a large, round bomb and drop it on the alien installation, by traveling across the landscape with either the jets or the lunar rover. The vehicle can't jump over gaps of terrain, and any crater or other feature has to be bridged with a special metal kit deployed by the hero. Both pieces of equipment have limited amounts of fuel available, displayed as two meters at the top of the screen. The jetpack is automatically refueled when the main character enters the rover.<br><br>The moon is inhabited with roaming alien creatures moving on random patterns, killing the protagonist when touching him. Jetman is protected from danger when driving the rover, but exposed when flying around to accomplish the mission.

Teleporters can be found on certain sections, instantaneously transporting the hero to distant places. A cannon can be collected and mounted on the back of the rover, to provide artillery support while searching for the base. If the player takes too long to explode the base, two missiles are launched from it targeting the rover and Earth. As they appear crossing the screen, Jetman has a last chance to intercept and destroy them. If he fails, the game is over.

Description=Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure set in a mechanical world where the player controls a small robot that has been kicked out of the city. He has to return and confront the Black Cap Brotherhood who terrorizes his kind and took away his girlfriend. The game consists of a number of static, non-scrolling screens the player gets to explore. This is done by clicking on objects in the environment to manipulate them, gathering them in an inventory and solving a wide array of puzzles, ranging from simple item combinations to more complex pattern analysis. The player's robot can scale his height to solve a number of problems, and communication is often presented graphically through speech bubbles that describe a scene using animated images, rather than words.<br><br>It is not possible to die, and when stuck, the player can opt to use a single hint (one per screen) or consult a walkthrough book. Pages in this book show the full solution to the level in the form of concept art panels, but to reach it a short side-scrolling shooter mini-game needs to be played. Therefore, the player cannot access it right away. In the beginning progress is done screen by screen, but after a while the world opens up more with many locations available at the same time.

Units can be moved over the map to attack enemy units and structures. Special units are required to gather resources which are required to build units and structures.<br><br>In Machines at War all units leave track marks which allows players to track units back to the enemy base. Other tactical elements exist in bodies of water which can only be crossed by building bridges and forest which give units additional cover.<br><br>Aside from buildings that produce units or allow for research there are also defensive structures such as walls, gates and turrets which can be used to further defend the base.<br><br>Units include a variety of tanks, jeeps, trucks, jets, helicopters and VTOLs.

Description=Madballs in Babo: Invasion is a game based on a toy-line of rubber balls of the same name, originally started in the mid-1980s and revived at the end of 2007. It is a mostly top-down shooter where the player controls one of these armed balls in a series of maze-like levels with slightly different paths leading to the same level goal.<br><br>It is set on the planet Babolon where balls of rock and goo evolved quickly into intelligent beings when the planet was hit by a streak of green light. The race was quickly divided into two factions, B*D*I and Scorched, both in search for the artifact that crashed on the planet, while a third faction was already trying to solve the mystery as well.<br><br>The singleplayer portion consists of a Campaign mode, Level Attack and Boot Camp (training). In the main mode players choose one of the two available factions to play an identical set of levels. Each faction also consists of five different classes based on health, speed, certain resistances and weaknesses, and specific abilities. The available classes are Assault, Heavy, Support, Flyer and Runner. They need to be unlocked gradually and it is encouraged to replay levels as certain functions and weapons only become available after a while.<br><br>The ball needs to traverse the levels, take out enemies with ranged weapons such as lasers or grenades and collect items, health, and solve small puzzles. Often there is an option to change the weapon, access terminals for additional information, or change the main character to a different class using a transmogrifier. All weapons generally have two shooting options and other special abilities (a spinning attack, bursts of speed) are tied to specific classes and factions. In later levels, the balls meet opponents with specific weaknesses that need to be taken advantage of using the appropriate weapon.<br><br>Even though most areas are maze-like and cramped, there are many different ways to approach them, using bridges, hidden passageways and jump pads. The gameplay is mostly action-based, but there are also some minor puzzle elements; often a number of glowing levels need to be touched to open up forcefields.<br><br>The multiplayer potion of the game offers online co-op with up to four players for individual levels or an Endure mode for the entire campaign, and regular match-ups with 21 maps and up to sixteen players.

Description=The Magical Flying Pink Pony Game is a first-person turret shooter set in a colorful, candyland world which the player attempts to deprive of its magical, pony populace. A macabre contrast, between the carefree environment and the bloody destruction that the player brings on it, is a running theme throughout the game.<br><br>By means of a stationary turret the player attempts to blast as many flying ponies out of the sky as they possibly can, gaining a number of points for each successful kill. The game possesses depth of field, and so ponies nearer the turret will collide with a fired missile sooner than ponies farther out in the field, requiring that the player fire in expectation of where a pony will be, rather then where they are. If ten ponies manage to make it from one side of the screen to the other alive, the game ends in a "Game Over", and the player must start again.<br><br>Particularly tricky shots, such as head or wing shots, provide the player with bonus points based on the difficulty of the shot. Each time the player manages several successive shots of any kind they are given a point multiplier; 2x for two in a row, 3x for three, etc. If the player misses, the multiplier is reset. As the player's score increases more difficult enemies appear, such as ponies which weave across the screen and green ponies, which take three shots to kill.<br><br>Noteworthy achievements, such as killing particularly large numbers of ponies or making a number of difficult kills, are tracked using a system of visual rank indicators at the lower end of the screen. The awards are broken up into three categories: stars, wedges, and bars. Stars are contingent on the number of score bonuses the player achieves, wedges on the number of kills, and bars on the player's raw score. Once the player achieves three advances of any of the three ranks they receive some form of reward in the shape of a better weapon, a brief bonus round, etc.<br><br>The game is available both as a stand-alone application and as a slightly less featured Dashboard widget, which has fewer display options. At the end of each play-through the player is given an opportunity to log their score on an online high score board and compare their achievements with those of other players.

The chests are unlocked using a combination of different keys, shown as the wand cursors hovers over them. They contain new spells, extra hints and new cursor wands. The repel spell removes any distracting animations from the screen, like flying books and other odd occurrences.<br><br>At the end of the first chapters, a separate screen appears split with two similar images, the top one in sepia tones and the bottom one in full colors. The goal is to replace the missing objects from the color image, using the complete sepia one as a reference, by dragging and dropping the items from the bottom of the screen. After completing it, a new spell is received and learned to be used on puzzles in the adventure sections. The fire spell sets stuff ablaze, the wind spell blows leaves and other debris to reveal concealed items, the petrify puzzle turns objects to stone, the heal spell brings dead things back to life and the detect spell reveals hidden objects.<br><br>The reveal spell acts as the hint button, showing the exact position of one of the required objects.

Description=You are a security guard who accompanied a group of space colonists on their trip on the huge space ship, the Marathon. Suddenly, aliens who call themselves Pfhor attack the ship and massacre the colonists. What's worse, the aliens damage the omniscient super-computers on Marathon. One of them is heavily damaged, and the other becomes insane! Caught in the midst of the battle between the two AIs, trying to stay alive in the onslaught of the Pfhor, you begin the desperate fight for survival...<br><br>In this first-person shooter, you have a variety of weapons that serve you in your battle against your enemies. Different types of enemies (organic or mechanical) take different amounts of damage depending on the weapon. You can also fire from two weapons (such as pistols) simultaneously. Shooting enemies is not the only thing you will do in "Marathon". It is possible to communicate with the damaged AIs of the ship by looking at messages they send you via computers. The story is unraveled primarily through those messages.

Description=Following the events of the original game, the Pfhor aliens have been defeated and the A.I. known as Durandral has been freed from it's containment. 17 years have passed and Durandral has assembled his own army from the colonists of Tau Ceti, including the Security Officer. Traveling across the galaxy, Durandral finds the home world of the S'pht, a Pfhor slave race, who Durandal liberates and who now worship Durandral as their Messiah. Durandal is searching for the location of a legendary lost tribe of S'pht who may hold the key to his mad quest for... well, whatever he's madly questing for. Unfortunately, the Pfhor dislike Durandral's presence and begin attacking his army. <br><br>Marathon 2: Durandal is the sequel to the first Marathon. Although the engine is similar to Doom in most respects (2.5D maps, bitmap sprites instead of polygons, etc.), Marathon 2 distinguishes itself with such features such as: a rudimentary inventory system, ambient sound, multiple fire modes for each weapon, allies who aid the player, enemies belonging to different factions which will attack each other, a more developed plot (gradually narrated to the player at various computer terminals scattered throughout the levels (much like System Shock's e-mail transmissions)).<br><br>The game's engine has gained a number of improvements over the original Marathon.  It now displays in a much larger portion of the screen, supports maps with four times the complexity and adds support for liquids and swimming.  All liquids use oxygen when the player is submerged and some also do damage.  Many levels have mechanisms allowing  areas to be flooded or drained, changing the depth of the liquid.<br><br>The other major new feature is a bunch of new multiplayer modes.  The entire single-player portion can be played cooperatively with up to eight players and the game adjusts weapon and monster placement accordingly.  In addition to "Every Man for Himself" mode (essentially deathmatch), it now includes "Kill of the Hill" where the object is to occupy a designated spot on the map more than anyone else, and "Kill the Guy with the Ball" where the object is to hold a skull the longest, the player holding it being unable to fire weapons.

Description=The long-awaited follow up to the "spaceploitation" strategy classics Master of Orion and Master of Orion 2, MOO 3 attempts to combine unprecedented depth with user-friendliness in one ultimate "4X" gaming eXperience.  The basic game formula is the same, though: start out with one planet, eXplore the galaxy, eXpand by founding new colonies and bases, eXploit resources, and then eXterminate your opponents--or at least show them who is boss!<br><br>Many years in the MOO timeline have passed since the last installment of the series.  The Antarans have triumphed and imposed their rule on the Orion sector, even dubbing themselves the "New Orions" in their pretentiousness.  Most of the old alien species have been defeated and nearly exterminated by the New Orions, but a few remnants of their civilizations still remain as non-playable races, so you will occasionally come across the odd colony of the Darlok, Bulrathi, Alkari, Mrrshan, Elerian, or Gnolam variety.   The 16 playable races that have survived the wrath of the Antarans include the insectoid Klackons and Tachidi; the reptilian Raas, Sakkra, and Grendarl; the fishlike Trilarian and Nommo; the robotic Cynoid and Meklar; the humanoid Human, Evon, and Psilon; the crystalline Silicoids; the ethereal Imsaeis and Eoladi; and the genetically-engineered harvesters, the Ithkul. <br><br>Management is handled primarily at the imperial level through general plans and policy decrees, with a system of AI viceroys assigned to doing most of the grunt work in managing the various regions of your colonized planets.  Up to four great leaders at a time may come forward and join your empire, adding bonuses (and perhaps also penalties) to your base racial abilities.  Research is divided into six schools: economics, energy, biological sciences, social sciences, physical sciences, and mathematics; some 380 technological advances are available overall, and not all will be available to your chosen race.<br><br>Ship and ground combat have both changed from previous MOO games.  Naval battles are played out in real time, with orders being given to ships assigned to the various task forces you organize before any battles take place.  The player now has more tactical options in commanding ground forces in planetary assaults.  Espionage is still available for implementing a variety of dirty tricks on opposing empires, and diplomacy is expanded so that you can now negotiate not only on an inter-empire basis, but also through the Orion Senate.  With enough votes, laws can be passed by the Senate which have galaxy-wide effects, thus making it possible for the clever diplomat to change the rules of the game to his own advantage.<br><br>Victory is yours if you can accomplish one of three things: eliminate all opponents and become Sole Survivor, garner enough votes through diplomacy to become President of the Senate, or recover the five mysterious alien artifacts--the "Antaran Xs"--scattered across the galaxy.   Just be prepared for a tough fight, because powerful Guardians will once again stand between you and total mastery of Orion.

Description=Max Payne has nothing to lose. His wife and son are gone, killed by Valkyr junkies. His DEA partner Alex is gone, killed by forces unknown, and Max is blamed for Alex's death. The mob is out to get him. The police are out to get him. The only way out is with guns blazing...<br><br>Max Payne is a 3rd person action shooter with a twist... Instead of just running around and shoot like Lara Croft, Max has a trick called Bullet-Time (tm). First seen in "The Matrix" movie, Bullet-Time slows the action WAY DOWN so you can shoot the bad guys full of holes before they take three steps... But your amount of bullet time is limited. <br><br>Perform rolls and leaps like those you see in action movies and perform bullet-time runs or shot-dodging. Take on all comers armed anywhere from baseball bats to Ingram sub-machine guns, even grenades and Molotov cocktails. Salvage ammo, weapons, and painkillers from this hellhole version of New York to keep your fighting edge. See plot develop in graphic novel-style panels. Will Max Payne see his revenge?

Description=Max & the Magic Marker is a physics based 2D puzzle platformer where the player needs to solve puzzles by drawing into the environment, forming physical objects that can be used to overcome puzzles. The game's protagonist is Max, a young boy who receives an envelope with a marker inside. He draws a monster, Mustacho, but suddenly the character comes to life and disappears into Max' drawings. Max chases after him and needs to travel through different worlds to halt the villain.<br><br>Max is able to run around, jump, push and pull objects, and climb up or slide down. At the same time the player controls a large marker on the screen. To use it, it needs to be filled with ink, which is collected through bubbles scattered around the level. At certain passages Mustacho often appears to vacuum all the ink out of the marker. Using the orange marker the player can draw lines and shapes into the environment to form objects. The possibilities are determined based on the amount of ink available and quick swipes use less ink compared to drawing slowly. Using the marker the player can draw steps, bridges and platforms to help out Max. More complex shapes are also possible, include shields, objects to drop down on enemies or to use seesaw mechanics; offering different possibilities to solve puzzles. Different objects can exist next to each other and independent lines can be connected to form complex shapes. At any time the used ink can be reclaimed to start over. When the objects are out of view the marker can be shaken to retrieve all of it.<br><br>There are different worlds to explore, each with a unique theme, and every world consists of multiple levels with checkpoints. At any time the player can swap between Max' imagination and the original drawings. In the original drawing mode the graphics change and time is halted. The latter is also used as a game mechanism to pause the game and draw objects without time constraints. Next to the ink each level also holds a number of secret items and gel bubbles. Max is vulnerable against most dangers, such as enemies and especially water or rain.<br><br>Collected objects open up additional play modes and secrets.

Description=This freeware, open-source remake of the platform game from 1987 replaces the limited graphics and sounds of the 8-bit original with several custom-built new sets. The gameplay remains the same, where the player controls the knight Popolon and his wife Aphrodite, on a quest to rescue the spirit of their unborn son Pamperses. The evil wizard Galious used his dark powers to ascend to the heavens and kidnap the baby's soul, and lock it away inside a prison in the labyrinth of rooms of his castle. The couple must transverse the maze-like building and travel to ten worlds, fighting against hordes of walking skeletons, vampire bats, and other bizarre creatures to finally reach Galious himself and kill him to liberate Pamperses' ghost.<br><br>Shrines appear on certain rooms, containing an oracle that helps the player in some way, by giving advice and hints, selling new weapons and tools, or saving progress with the password system. The 45-characters password can be noted down and entered manually like in the original, or saved and loaded from the disk. The graphics and sounds sets can also be changed on the fly with keyboard keys.

The player moves with the arrow keys and shoots his bottomless firearm (optionally strafing) while exploring the gridly confines of the maze and dispersing its fog of war while trying to avoid being shot by opponents not-yet-seen, off-screen.  The view is very close-up so as to better implement the game's experimental concept, rendering simple pixel-art sprites and scenery in organically-patterned textures, furthering creative visual ideas explored earlier in the author's Sticky Notes Shooter.<br><br>Players gain levels after slaying enough enemies, and gain abilities from new equipment they find -- from the more-damaging banana gun to the dodge-enhancing propeller hat.  Successful players will not only accumulate money (score) and XP (and hence, levels) but will also literally ascend through different (randomly-generated, again) levels of the cosmic labyrinth upon locating staircases.

The combat occurs on a separate screen, showing at each side two columns containing portraits of the fighters' avatars and a list of the acquired skills, with a grid filled with assorted tiles occupying most of the screen at the center. Two meters frame each portrait, one for loyalty and the other for stamina. The objective is to either fill the enemy loyalty gauge, or empty the stamina one.<br><br>Each combatant takes turns swapping adjacent tiles, trying to make matches of three or more of the same type. The tiles have specific uses. The whip takes away some of the enemy's stamina. The heart fills a portion of the loyalty meter. The other tiles fill four buttons at the top of the skill list. Each skill requires a number of points from one of these buttons. Special tiles, like the wild card that matches any sequence of tiles, or the chameleon that duplicates adjacent tiles, appear randomly on the board. A new skill is available after every four levels.<br><br>After the battle, the game shows a map of the high school with the avatar figure superimposed walking over it. Two icons at the bottom, a ? and a !, give access to lists of pending quests and sub-quests, respectively. Clicking on the list entries makes the avatar move towards the quest location. At the top right, a portrait shows how the character is developing. Depending on how each battle is won, the character can lean towards good or evil, affecting the game's ending.

Money can be used to enhance your cinema.

Description=Flight Simulator for the Apple Macintosh became the third port of FS to a Motorola 68000 platform, following the Amiga and Atari ST.  However, Microsoft, rather than subLOGIC, published the Mac version.  While the first Mac release was dubbed "Version 1.0", it was in fact released four years after Version 1.0 for the PC, and thus was much different in nature.  The graphics engine was much closer to Flight Simulator II for the Amiga and Atari ST.  Naturally, the Mac edition was monochrome only, but at a higher resolution.  The mouse was used for the throttle, yoke, and brakes, while the keyboard controlled the rest.  Like FS II and MSFS 3.0, FS1 for the Mac featured pull-down menus and multiple view windows for the cockpit, spot plane, map, and control tower.<br><br>MSFS for Mac could run on any classic Mac down to the 128k, although at that level, the "war game", sound, and situation library were disabled.

Description=In Might and Magic, the player controls a party of adventurers in a medieval world called Varn. Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Your task is to find the real king and ultimately to stop the alien invasion into Varn.<br><br>This is the first game in the  Might and Magic series, and one of the prototypes of role-playing games in general. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. The player creates a party of six adventurers, with traditional classes to choose from (fighter, cleric, etc.). The player also specifies the gender and the age of the characters - they grow old and will eventually die of natural causes. As in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world, performing quests, and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The turn-based battles typically take place against six monsters, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain.

At each stop Millie meets various tree-dwelling denizens and the player learns the facts about life inside and around a tree and all the processes that maintain it. <br><br>Actions in this game are all accomplished with the mouse, by pointing, clicking, or dragging. The cursor changes into Millie's little copter when it passes over a clickable spot, and there are lots of them; nearly every object has an explanation or an animation attached to it. In the tray at the bottom of the main screen are icons for accessing mini-games, keeping track of photos taken, adjusting volume, language selection, and exiting the game. During mini-games, you'll also have icons for help, back, and starting a new round; the printing icon, available from Millie's Tricktionary and the drawing page, takes the form of a rubber stamp.<br><br>On the right side of the main screen there is a narrow panel showing the oak tree, with an inset picture of whatever area you are in/character you are speaking to at the time.

Two games are arcade-style and allow for two levels of difficulty - these are &quot;Catch the Acorn&quot; and &quot; The Earthworm Labyrinth&quot;. Three games test the player's knowledge of a tree's ecosystem, but are easily answered after playing the main game - these are &quot;True or False?&quot;, &quot;Who's That Singing?&quot;, and &quot;Who Lives Where?&quot;. The last is a picture game that allows you to choose pictures to enlarge or minimize, turn, and arrange on a printable page. Also available after completing the game is Millie's Tricktionary, a book of science experiments with printable pages.

Description=Little Millie Meter, also appearing in Millie Meter and Her Adventure in the Oak Tree, hears a mysterious sneeze and some ominous rumbling as shes out walking, and discovers a Giant family hidden in the rocks. All of them are feeling a little poorly, especially Bulk, the youngest, and Millie volunteers to take a look inside his body to hunt down the reason for his stomach distress. She hops into the space capsule, Bulk yawns widely, and off she goes into the cave of his mouth on an adventure through all the parts of the digestive system. In each location, she will find a game and win one piece of the Golden Pyramid. Only when the Golden Pyramid is fully assembled will Millie understand what is wrong with the giants. <br><br>Players may be reminded of Pajama Sam 3: You Are What You Eat From Your Head To Your Feet as this game also illustrates the importance of good nutrition, but there the resemblance ends. The hand-drawn look is typical of Tivola's games with BVM (see also Oscar the Balloonist and the Secrets of the Forest), and like Millie Meter and Her Adventure in the Oak Tree, this adventure is entirely mouse-controlled.  <br><br>At the bottom of each page are the option icons - at the far left is the pyramid, which shows how many pieces are still missing. The blue refrigerator holds games and the Tricktionary; Bulk's face is the volume control (move the tongue left or right for less or more volume); click on the flag to change languages; or on Millie to exit the game. <br><br>On the right is a panel showing the figure of Bulk and a round x-ray viewer. The player can move this up and down to advance from area to area or travel by clicking on doors in the main screen. Millie begins her adventure in the mouth, proceeds down into the esophagus and then the stomach. From there she goes to the small intestine, takes a side trip to the liver, and finishes up in the large intestine where the, um, exit is. Characters manning various stations along the way provide explanations of the processes of digestion, and there are six mini-games that reinforce some of the concepts covered. <br><br>1. The Pipeline Game - flip, turn, cork, and place the pipe sections so that liquid flows unimpeded from the top left to the bottom right<br>2. Flying Food - try to get all the flying food into the right spot by clicking the up &amp; down arrows as it moves across the screen<br>3.

The Fruit and Veg Workshop - an art page, where the player can drag pictures onto the page,  resize/reorient them and print it<br>5. The Fruit and Vegetable Jigsaw - just what it says, a jigsaw puzzle of a whimsical picture<br>6. True or False? - Chloe makes a statement, and the player must decide if it is true or false<br><br>Once all six games have been completed, the player also gains access to Millie's Tricktionary, a book of science experiments centered around nutrition; pages from this may be printed out.

The words can be input with the keyboard or by clicking on the alphabet at the bottom of the screen with the mouse.<br><br>The game starts with a elimination stage, where the player competes against a human or CPU-controlled contestant in four rounds, switching celebrities halfway through. The celebrity clues are listed at the top-right, and the player has to make a guess after receiving each one. The hidden words, or passwords as the game calls them, can be skipped to be solved later, if there's enough time left. The objective is to guess five words, with a unlimited amount of clues allowed. The contestant with the highest score moves to the next stage.<br><br>In the million dollar stage, the player has to guess five words on each of the six rounds, and words can only have three clues.

If they lose, the money is lost as well.<br><br>Mini-games appear between the rounds, giving extra time when successfully completed. The crossword puzzle works like its newspaper counterpart, where the player has to complete the grid based on a list of clues at the left side. In the word search, the player has to click and drag over words corresponding to the clues, on a grid filled with letters. In the word association game, the goal is link two related words, by selecting them from two columns with the mouse.

Description=Minecraft is a game which mixes elements of sandbox, survival horror and construction game. It is an evolved version of Minecraft Classic<br><br>As in Minecraft Classic the player is dropped in a randomly generated world made out of cubes. Unlike the classic version where the player can add and remove blocks at will, in this version all blocks the player wants to place must first be "mined" elsewhere. Some materials require special equipment to be mined. Stone requires a wooden pick axe to be mined; gold requires an iron pick axe and obsidian requires a diamond pick axe. The player can also create shovels and normal axes to mine sand, dirt and wood faster. Mining is no longer instant but requires the player to hit the block a couple times, tools reduce the time.<br><br>Some blocks can not be found in nature but require crafting. Clay, for example, can be split into clay balls, which when baked turn into bricks which can be combined to form brick wall blocks. Baking happens in a stone oven, which requires a steady supply of coal and the oven itself needs to be crafted at a workbench, which needs to be constructed first.<br><br>This time the player(s) are not alone. During the day pigs, chickens, cows and sheep roam the land. Some of them, when killed or struck, will drop valuable items such as leather required for protective clothing or pork chops which when baked can heal the player. But at night and in the dark randomly generated caverns monsters rule the land. There are various different monsters, including the zombie, a skeleton archer, an exploding creeper, deadly spiders and gelatinous cubes. Aside from randomly spawning in dark areas, they also spawn in so-called "mob spawners" which spawn enemies indefinitely until properly illuminated or destroyed. To defend himself against enemies the player can craft weapons such as a sword and bow, and protective clothing to reduce damage. When the player dies his items are dropped at the place of his death, but the player respawns at his original spawn point. Items can be recovered if the player reaches them within five minutes (unless they fell into lava).<br><br>The randomly generated worlds are structured in such a fashion that more valuable resources are either rare or only spawn in deep caverns far below the ground.<br><br>Aside from building blocks the game also, unlike its previous versions, offers more complex building. The player can create railway systems and ride mine carts, row in a small boat, and build pressure plates, switches, doors and electrical circuits to power various contraptions.<br><br>The game features no pre-set goals and advocates exploration and construction.

Description=MMORPG Tycoon is a strategy game with glowing vector graphics developed for the TIGSource Procedural Generation competition. The player becomes the new owner of ShadiSoft Software, a development studio that went bust when their MMORPG failed to attract the public's attention. Taking command of the designers and programmers, the game's goal is to make the MMORPG successful again and destroy the competition.<br><br>The player has a futuristic, top-down overview of the game world, with extensive zoom options to view as close as a single player. Tasks for instance include planning the location of towns where players rest and pick up quests. Towns can have different levels and highly-skilled players will soon start looking for new places to stay. To avoid frustration, starting and respawn points need to be strategically planned, nearby towns and in low-level areas to avoid meetings with powerful players. They can be guided further by placing roads that lead to safe havens so they do not get lost. Without respawn points, players go offline and most likely cancel their account.<br><br>Progress is made based on the amount of subscriptions, as those bring in the money. Players need different locations to visit and the server cannot be too overloaded. Other accidents include extra players dropping offline when more than one hundred of them are inside a single area (sloppy ShadiSoft Software programming). Occasionally, this even crashes the entire region server. Overcrowded areas are marked in red on the map. Other information about progress is provided through different reports.<br><br>Players can manage zoning, build different kinds of objects and change the general design such as classes, the monster density and their statistics, the amount of experience, and keep track of the general cash flow, loans, subscriptions, the amount of employees, the competitors and more. Subscribers will often complain about overloaded servers, or the game being too easy or too hard. It is even possible to view the division of the different classes used in the game and general satisfaction. The forums also show the general buzz in comments, both negative and positive.<br><br>Aside from the regions, every single user can be tracked with the inspect tool. It shows information such as their name, class, level and experience. The game can be paused at any time to plan a next move without having time move on.

The Minis promptly steal the secret M&Ms formulas and cause havoc at the factory. It is up to the yellow candy to set the situation right.<br><br>The gameplay has been described as being similar to the Crash Bandicoot series. The action in the game takes place over 8 levels. The first 7 levels involve some kind of math skill (configurable at various skill levels to cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The first level depicts the yellow candy frantically driving back to the candy factory. Along the way are math formulas on the side of the road, followed closely by 3 crates on the road, each with a number. Striking the crate with the correct answer for the previous formula will allow passage, while the 2 wrong answers are steel crates that will end your vehicle. The same action is repeated in a later level involving a forklift.<br><br>Another type of level has the yellow candy jumping from number platform to number platform according to the math formulas that a disembodied female voice calls out. Another type of level is a 3D running/jumping action level in which the yellow candy will run down a hallway while observing clues about math formulas along the way. At the end of the hallway will be 3 doors, each with a possible answer. Choose wisely.<br><br>All along the way are M&Ms candies to be collected in large quantities. Every 100 M&Ms candies earns the player an extra life.<br><br>The PlayStation version is basically the same game but minus the Math mode.

The title makes use of a facetious-horror design that provides a sense of levity in an otherwise murky setting.<br><br>Gameplay is founded on the simplicity and plainness of the board game checkers, with each unit being identical to another in terms of function but of varying degrees of strength, which is dictated by the size of the monster. At the beginning of each turn players move one of their respective monster balls up to two spaces in any direction across the game board. If the monster ball lands on a space already occupied by an opponent then they battle, with the larger of the two swallowing the smaller and growing in proportion to the size of the devoured enemy. In the event that a monster grows too large it explodes, thereby depriving the player of one of their pieces.<br><br>As an additional factor there are numerous special tiles, such as rocket launchers and fortresses, strewn across the board, which are activated when landed on. Also present are 'mystery' tiles, whose effects vary widely, from indiscriminate rocket launcher attacks to a functionless shimmer of sparkles. Depending on the type of tile that is used it will either have only one use, disappearing afterward, or it will remain on the board for the entirety of the game; new special tiles occasionally appearing at random on the board to replace those used.<br><br>The game is presented as an assortment of unrelated scenarios, rather than a cohesive campaign, each with their own theme or play style. Each of the scenarios has a uniquely sized board and one of two victory conditions; obliterating all of the enemy monsters or instead capturing their flag. Additional scenarios can be downloaded within the game to add to those included with it.<br><br>A system of trophy rewards is supported within the game which rewards the player with either a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum award based on their accomplishments. Among the available trophies that players can gain are "Killing Spree", "Rocketeer", and "Death or Glory".

As moshers pass Melvin they will lash out at him with one of their many limbs, depleting the player's vitality meter and subtracting points from their overall score. Melvin, in turn, can flail out against the other moshers by punching or kicking them, which causes him to gain points. Melvin, alternatively, can mosh non-violently, in the form of headbanging, which slowly accrues him points but leaves him vulnerable to other moshers. As moshers are knocked senseless to the ground by Melvin's onslaught they will be slowly replaced by new arrivals, similarly inspired by Silent Static's aural offensive. As such the game ends only after Melvin is knocked unconscious or after the player retreats through an exit positioned off to the side, thereafter being presented with their final score and the option to play again. The end result is identical, regardless of how the player chooses to end the game, having no effect on either the resulting screen or score.<br><br>The game does not posses a high-score board, nor does it keep track of any of the scores the player has achieved. Instead, the Read Me encourages players to take a screenshot of the score screen using the Macintosh's built-in screen capture tool and email the resulting shot to the developer.

Description=Have you ever wanted to try running your own movies studio? <br><br>The Movies gives you that opportunity by putting you in the shoes of an aspiring movie mogul starting in 1920s Hollywood. Hire directors and actors for your films, ensuring they get enough acting/directing practice to ensure they'll give their best performances. Be careful not to stress them too much though or next thing you'll know, they'll be drowning their sorrows with alcohol (or food). Don't forget to recruit builders, janitors, film crew, scientists, scriptwriters and personal assistants too, they're also just as important to ensuring the success of your studio. <br><br>Once you've hired the actors, directors and ancillary staff you require to make movies, you'll also need to construct places for them to work and relax. A majority of your studio lot will be occupied by sets of one of five genres (Action, Sci-Fi, Horror, Romance and Comedy) which you can research and then build to be used for filming your movies. While your scriptwriters are making the final touches to that 5-star film script, you can get your directors and actors to practice their roles on the set. <br><br>Eventually the script is complete and you must then decide which actors and directors would make the best fit for the film as the game takes into account not only how much experience the actors/directors have, but how good-looking they are (important for actors) and how well they get along with the rest of the crew. Filming then starts and it's your job to make sure that the actors and directors don't throw tantrums on the set or this could adversely affect the quality of the movie (not to mention prove expensive due to delays). Usually you would do so by making sure they pay a visit to the bar or restaurant beforehand (but don't make this too often or else they may get addicted and a visit to the Rehab Centre is in order)!<br><br>When the last scene is finally shot, your movie is then ready to be released to the world! Keep an eye on movie critic reviews to gauge what can be improved next time you make a film if you want to ensure your studio isn't making B-grade movies indefinitely!

Description=Mummy Maze Deluxe is an electronic adaptation of the pencil-and-paper maze puzzle Theseus and the Minotaur by Robert Abbott, first published in 1962. It is based on the concept of logic mazes where an exit needs to be found, but with a number of rules that restrict or modify the possible movement. Locating the exit does not consist of travelling towards it directly, the introduced limitations can be based on arrows restricting directions, opened or closed doors, or the amount of spaces each move is permitted to be. The name of the maze is based on the Greek legend of Theseus who needs to outsmart the stronger and faster minotaur in his own labyrinth.<br><br>In PopCap's take on the concept, the setting is moved to Egypt where the player controls an explorer in search of treasure. Instead of minotaurs, the explorer encounters different types of mummies and scorpions. The level lay-out of the mazes is seemingly simple, but usually a large number of steps is needed to enter the exit. Played in turns, mummies can move two steps at a time, while the explorer is limited to one. To outsmart enemies, they need to be lured away. Enemies do not react to the player directly, but to a specific logic of vertical and horizontal movement. Once discovered, this can be exploited by the player. For instance, when on a tile surrounded by walls on three sides, the mummy will not leave his position when his logic anticipating the player's movement prevents him from moving into the direction of the exit. Further rules are added through a number of traps, multiple mummies (who get into a fight where one is killed when the explorer lures them towards each other), a key that opens or closes a gate, and the specific position of walls. Although most levels seem to resemble each other, the solution is always different.<br><br>The game's main mode is called Adventure. It consists of fifteen pyramids, with fifteen levels each, that need to be unlocked gradually. After finishing a pyramid, a treasure is provided and in the final pyramid the valuable riches of Pharaoh Tutankhamen await the player. The Classic mode has similar gameplay, but there the mazes are randomly generated with an increasing difficulty. The Adventure mode only keeps track of the player's completion time, but in the Classic mode points are awarded based on how quickly the maze is solved. The game also contains a tutorial where the basic game mechanics are explained in three sessions.<br><br>After completing a level, progress is saved automatically. During gameplay the player can also undo as many moves as needed or reset the entire maze. An ankh near the left side of the screen turns red when the explorer is moved into a position where he can no longer solve the maze. The explorer is controlled through the cursor keys or the mouse. Sometimes, it is also need to perform a "wait" action, where the player skips his turn, used to lure an enemy into a specific position or movement pattern.

Some levels have piles of resources laying around, that can be collected directly by one of the workers. The resources can also be produced by the workers, or by a specialized building. For example, a serf can fell trees to produce wood, or a sawmill can be constructed to produce lumber stacks.<br><br>A bonus meter fills slowly at the bottom of the screen, helping the player after being activated by providing temporary extra serfs, more speed to the workers and freezing the timer for ten seconds. The tasks vary from level to level: in the first levels the objectives are fairly simple, gradually introducing the basic gameplay mechanics to the player. The path has to be unblocked by cutting away overgrowth and tree stumps, sections of swamp have to be converted into paved roads and specific buildings have to be built before time runs out. The time meter has a marker indicating the start of the night. If the player is able to finish everything before nightfall, the castle receives an upgrade.

Description=MyMan is a text graphic remake of Pacman. Gameplay is simply the same as Pacman; you go around a maze eating all the dots, while avoiding ghosts. The maze has four flashing dots that make the ghosts edible when you eat them.  During the first levels the ghosts stay edible longer, but when the levels continue on, they are edible for a shorter amount of time. As you progress through a level, their will be a bonus fruit somewhere in the maze; every new level, the fruit is worth more than it was the previous level.<br><br>The characters in the game are made of letters.  For example, MyMan is a C, the ghosts are A's is enemy mode and m's in edible mode, and the fruits are made up as %, v, etc. When you lose all your lives you get a game over, and the game closes automatically, and there is no highscore.

In the Piano room at Greveholm the duke is trying to play "The old castle song," but his sheet of music with the song is missing.<br>The culprit is Jean, who has painted portraits of the duke on the back of the sheet of music, which were sent to different parts of Sweden to show how handsome the duke is and to find him a wife. Jean is punished for his mistake and the princess decides to help him and locate all the portraits. To start she will need the help of Sprak, who will provide her with useful items for her quest.<br>Unlike the sequel, this installment uses a similar interface as the original game.

Description=An ancient Celtic artifact was uncovered in the isolated hamlet of Dire Grove, in the United Kingdom. A group of American graduate researchers travels to the location to find the truth about the legends of the region, but are never heard or seen again. After successfully solving the mysteries of the haunted Ravenhearst state, an investigator is hired to search for the missing students, finding a video camera and tapes shot by them scattered around the desolate, frozen landscape surrounding the abandoned hotel that was their campsite.<br><br>Mystery Case Files: Dire Grove is the most ambitious entry in the Mystery Cases series by Big Fish Games so far. Instead of being a pure hidden object game like the first titles, the game follows the recent trend of inserting hidden object screens within a classic point-and-click adventure design, with a drag-and-drop inventory and simple puzzles tailored for the casual market. One big addition from the preceding Ravenhearst game is the inclusion of full-motion video clips with live actors that take almost half of the screen. They can be found as VHS tapes laying around the many locations of the game, and played on the crime computer to develop the plot further.<br><br>The scenes are presented as a series of mostly static screens with snowfall and other short animations added as atmospheric effects. The player navigates through the locations by placing the cursor on the edges or on obvious openings like holes and doors, where the cursor becomes a golden arrow that can be clicked to move to the next room. Some portions of the scenery shimmer to indicate the existence of one of the hidden object screens on a particular spot.<br><br>The hidden object sections take place on separate screens, where the objective is to find and click on all the items listed at the bottom. The hint button at the bottom-right shows the position of one of the required objects when activated, but takes some time to recharge after use. After collecting all the list entries, one of the objects is stored inside the inventory to be used later when solving puzzles.<br><br>The inventory can be accessed directly, by moving the cursor to the bottom of the screen to make a series of slots appear, that can be scrolled left or right with the interface arrows. Like in most adventure games, the objects have to be dragged and dropped on logical places of the scenery to solve puzzles and perform actions. For example, a key can be used on a lock open a door. A journal keeps track of any information needed to solve some of the puzzles, acting as general guide to the game. Some of the puzzles take place on self-contained screens, where a mechanism of some sort has to be manipulated directly to solve them.

Description=Mystery Island II is a first-person puzzle-based adventure game in which the player takes the role of Lt. Steven Bushell, a U.S. Navy Seal onboard the USS Volarus. While on patrol the Volarus is destroyed under unusual circumstances by an unidentified vessel, assumed to be a Russian warship. As the only survivor of the blast the player washes up on the shores of an uninhabited tropical island. As he explores his temporary home he uncovers that the island houses technology and structures unfamiliar to him, and subsequently uncovers a secret which may threaten the fate of mankind.<br><br>The locations that the player explores within the game are presented as static, pre-rendered images to be surveyed and interacted with, giving a somewhat surreal impression of the game world. The player navigates the world by rotating the protagonist left or right and clicking specific sections of the screen to advance ahead to that area, rather than simply clicking forward to advance forward.<br><br>Gameplay is largely based on exploration of the various locations within the game, to the point that many puzzles may be solved simply by gathering and making use of disparate information scattered within the game world. In keeping with this the player's mouse cursor is unchanging, giving no indication of whether an object is takable, capable of being interacted with, or simply observable. As such if an object is clicked on the default response is for it to be described, interaction only taking place in cases where it would be logical and objects being taken only where necessary. The inventory system has been equally optimized to support this play style. If the player happens to click on an object in their possession it will be described or commented on by Lt. Bushell via text string unless they happen to be in a location where the item can be used, in which case it will be used without requiring more specific prompting from the player. This emphasis on information over objects makes the oft used adventure game approach of 'brute forcing' the game by trial and error virtually impossible.

Description=Mystery of Shark Island is a hidden object game where the player must find shells and pieces of artifacts, half-buried in the beach sands of an archipelago. The plot is told through a series of sketch drawings with text that pop up on certain points in the game. The main character wakes up on a island, washed ashore with a broken arm besides a magic box that exchanges shells for keys.<br><br>The main game screen is divided in two, the top portion showing the island shore covered with beach sand, shells and assorted flotsam and jetsam. The bottom portion is dedicated to the interface, showing the box and its strange cravings. At the start of each stage, a wave washes the beach and two sliding doors open up revealing the required items to complete the level. Most objects are shells and the occasional piece of bass relief, that must be found and clicked on the beach before the next wave comes.<br><br>The objective of each level is to reach a set amount of points, shown at the left side of the box. Several correct clicks fill a conch-shaped streak meter that multiplies the points, while wrong clicks reset it. A blue meter shows the time remaining before the next wave. Picking objects of the same type in a row gives extra points. Some objects are covered with a layer of sand that must be brushed aside before they can be collected.<br><br>Some power-ups coins appear randomly on the beach. The wind coin blows all useless objects from the screen. The super brush coin cleans all the sand covered objects of the beach. The strength coin makes lifting heavy rocks easier.

The hourglass coin increases the time before the next wave.<br><br>At the end of each stage, the box reveals and stores a key on slots at the top. These keys are used after the final level, to rotate the segments of a circular jigsaw puzzle.

Description=Madison travels to Brazil to find her sister Abby, that was stationed on the region working for National Geographic before mysteriously disappearing. While searching for clues, she stumbles upon ancient artifacts leading to the legendary Lost City of Z.<br><br>Lost City of Z is a hidden object game with adventure elements and an archaeological theme. Like Herod's Lost Tomb by the same developers, this game is based on a National Geographic documentary, with some footage from the special being used on cutscenes between chapters. The screen shows a location with several objects scattered throughout the scenery, and the main objective is to find and click on all the items listed on a film strip at the bottom. Some portions of the scene can be clicked to open a zoom view window, often containing some of the required objects. Some of the items are stored in the inventory for later use, or inside one of four pocket pouches to be used as tools.<br><br>The first tool is a camera that has to be used to take a picture of an animal. The name of the creature is written in yellow on the list. Once selected, the player has to center the lens viewfinder on the subject and click to snap the photo. The pictures are added to the main character diary, as illustrations to entries about the fauna. They can also be accessed from the main menu and set as the desktop wallpaper. Other tools include a knife, useful to cut through thick foliage, and a flashlight to illuminate dark caves and other dimly lit locations.<br><br>Mini-games appear occasionally on separate screens, where a mechanism of some sort has to be manipulated directly. The list is usually replaced by the inventory in these sections, from where the stored objects can be dragged and dropped on logical portions of the scenery to solve puzzles. In the course of the game, the player will follow coordinates to place pins on a map and find a route, organize a series of stones on a grid, unlock a stone door with the correct sequence of keys and encounter other similar challenges.<br><br>The hint system is a GPS device that places a radar circle near one of the required objects, but takes a few minutes to recharge after use. It also shows pictures of any list entry.

Description=The 2006 game in the Need for Speed series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.<br><br>Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.<br><br>The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.<br><br>The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.

The game remains the same basic strategy title, where the goal is to build lots of autonomous robots to destroy the opponent's machines and resources. The player controls a hovering aircraft that acts as a cursor, moving it around the map to show all the available installations and buildings, where machines are constructed and raw materials are harvested. Construction buildings have landing pads that open up menus with options.<br><br>A mini-map at the bottom shows the whole extension of the map, with blinking dots pinpointing the relative positions of the ship and the robots. When placing the aircraft on a factory, the construction menu appears where robots can be assembled from several different pieces, to give them singular abilities and weapons. The robots can be ordered about by landing on their heads, and choosing one of the options from a list of commands. The main objective is to send the robot army to take over the factories of the enemy and eliminate the opposing units. Besides recreating the default map, several new ones are included as well, some much more complex than the old, primitive original.

Unlike most add-ons, this expansion doesn't extend the first game. It is an entirely new campaign in which players can start a brand new character or load up a previously saved NWN character.<br><br>The story begins in Master Drogan's School for Heroes amidst the snowy mountains in the northern portion of the Forgotten Realms. Your studies finished, you and several other adventurers are just about to graduate. As you walk toward the main hall, havoc ensues as a band of kobolds attacks, stealing four magical artifacts and seriously injuring Master Drogan, who is unconscious. You are sent out into the world to find a special healing potion for Drogan and to recover the stolen artifacts. Your travels will take you deep into the Nether Mountains, the Anauroch Desert with a caravan of halfling gypsies, and high above the earth inside the flying city of Undrentide. <br><br>The game is divided into 3 Sections comprised of Chapter 1, the Interlude and Chapter 2, and gameplay does not differ from the original game with the same engine and interface throughout. But there is more interaction with your "henchmen" companions in this expansion.<br><br>At first, you can choose between 2 companions to accompany you: the self-righteous, half-orc sorcerer Xanos or Dorna Trapspringer, a dwarven rogue-cleric. Later on you can choose Deekin, a kobold Bard. Each one has a unique personality, attributes and abilities which you can access by talking to them or selecting it. For instance, talk to Dorna and ask her to cast one of her cleric spells. If they have double classes (as is the case with Dorna), you can tell them to "train up" in just one or both of them as they increase in levels. <br><br>The ability to view and manipulate your henchman's inventory is new, allowing you to equip them and load them down with objects as you see fit.<br><br>When you have advanced higher in experience, you can choose one of the 5 new Prestige classes, or continue on with your current class. The new Prestige Classes are:<br><br>1. Assassin (Stealthy, back-stabbing attacker)<br>2. Arcane Archer (Spell-casting Ranger with special ranged attack abilities)<br>3. Blackguard (Evil Warrior, absolute opposite of a Paladin)<br>4. Harper Scout (Stealthy Rogue/Ranger)<br>5. Shadow Dancer (Evasive and stealthy Magic user)<br><br>Your character can be played in the single-player game as well as in the multiplayer online world. If you are into making MODs or being a Virtual Dungeon Master, Shadows of Undrentide adds more goodies to play with. The winter, ruins, and desert tile sets give module creators more variety, as do the new classes, monsters, skills, and feats.

Description=In the best tradition of pyramid exploration, you start this contemplative first-person adventure game trapped, with no way to go but deeper into the ancient Egyptian tomb.  As a journeyman archaeologist banned from the Kirdaza site, you're not even supposed to be there.  The dig is closed, oil company property, and no one will come looking for you.  Your crackpot notions of a three thousand-year history for the vast tomb, possibly hiding secrets to the origin of life, have made your colleagues eager to forget you, while the earthquake and aftershocks are guaranteeing they will.<br><br>As you probe deeper, opening one new passage after another, carefully navigating the remarkable engineering of the tomb, you find you are following in the footsteps of another outcast archaeologist.  One hundred seventy years before you, when the tomb was first discovered by modern science, someone else trod this path into its heart, leaving notes along the way.  They provide clues and warnings, but the most valuable map comes from your own notes on the mythical passage of the sun god, Re, into the underworld.  The secrets of the tomb run deep into the earth, and neither fire nor water -- nor even gravity -- behave as they should.<br><br>Ambient, stereo sound and simple exploration mechanics give the game an immersive atmosphere.  There are no sudden turns or steps forward; all movement is smooth, executed by clicking and holding on the direction you wish to turn or move.  Motion stops when you release the mouse button.  In this way, you can slowly spin 360 degrees in the horizontal, while at the same letting your gaze wander from floor to ceiling.  Similarly, you move objects by clicking and dragging.  You can carry a small inventory, and a map and compass take some of the guesswork out of finding your way around.  Nonetheless, the size of the tomb makes getting lost a part of game play.  The puzzles are closely focused on ancient Egyptian culture, and by the time you complete your journey through the tomb, you will be well-versed in the narrative of the Re's boat passage, which was central to ancient Egyptian funerary rites.

Until, that is, he goes to sleep one night and dreams up the Number Devil! Each night for 10 nights after that, The Number Devil takes Robert on a tour of math concepts, bringing them to life in funny and imaginative ways.<br><br>You're invited to sit back and listen as the Number Devil explains mathematical ideas to Robert, and then step in and participate by using the mouse and the keyboard to help Robert solve math problems. At the end of each lesson there is a game that reinforces that night's concept. <br><br>Most of the action is point and click, although you can use the keyboard to enter numbers for blackboard problems, and the arrow keys are necessary for some of the chapter-ending games, such as the "Sleigh Ride in Owl's Wood".

The Table of Contents is broken up into two parts - The Contents list, and the Seek and Ye Shall Find list. Click on a listing on the Contents page and you'll get an explanation of everything that was discussed on that night, and each part of the explanation is a link to the section of the game where that part was covered. The Seek list is an index of everything covered - clicking on a word will bring up a link to the part of the game where it is explained; these are particularly useful options for finding the mathematical concepts you need to review.<br><br>The concepts range from fairly simple (the discovery and importance of zero) to quite sophisticated (The Golden section; planes, knots and lines), making the game playable from the suggested 8-year-old level all the way through high school and beyond.<br><br>Some of the games at the end of each chapter are purposely reminiscent of some well-known titles; there is a Pac-Man type maze and a Tetris-inspired game, for example.

When one of the three actions can be used, a prompt lights up at the bottom of the screen, informing the player. Many individual items that the player finds in the course of the game require a separate, unique action to be used, which is explained in-game for each individual object that the player comes across.<br><br>Whether Tom is an efficient, helpful intern or a destructive liability will be noticed by his co-workers, represented by a reputation meter at the bottom of the screen. Based on the level of the reputation meter, certain areas of the game will become accessible to the player that were previously off limits. If Tom becomes so beloved or despised that the reputation meter is either filled or emptied the game ends in a way that reflects the player's handiwork, whether constructive or catastrophic.

Description=It's 2032. The planet is now ruled by the World Coalition Government which annexed 80% of the countries, with the remaining quickly dragged into the WCG. While their official goal was to solve humankind's problems, it was about money. Massive spending bankrupted poorer countries, and soon all traces of individual government disappeared. For those who were poor, the situation didn't improved one bit, and for the richer, maintaining the status was done at the expense of their privacy and personal freedoms. To make things worse, life outside the major cities, far from the atmosphere processors is nearly impossible, as the so-called "Wilderness Preserves" are poisoned, and those who venture into them risk a painful death.<br><br>Konoko, fresh out from TCTF (Technology Crimes Task Force, a secret police to take cyber drugs and weapons from the streets, as well as explore the induced technophobia to operate and investigate on a blank check permission) academy is placed under the command of Terrance Griffin and Dr. Kerr and linked to a SLD - an android - called Shinatama, who is neurally linked to her. However, Konoko knows next to nothing about her past, other that she was orphaned at the age of three and felt "different" to other people while was being brought up under the wing of TCTF. After many years in training, she has finally the chance to prove herself to Griffin and the TCTF, and so, heads for a warehouse rumoured to be under the control of the Syndicate, a criminal organization which grew exponentially after a young man called "Boss Muro" climbed to the top of the organization.<br><br>Inspired by the classic Anime series Ghost in the Shell by Shirow Masamune, gameplay is a mix between generic third-person shooter and a classic beat'em up. While Konoko has at her disposal several hand-to-hand  acrobatic moves (with more unlocked as the player advances), she can also find weapons in the levels, and the decision to go armed or bare-fisted is only up to the player. Each weapon either draws from ballistic or energy cell clips, the number of rounds in each clip depending on the weapon: a Black Adder (a short, one-hand machine gun like an Uzi) can get 30 rounds from a ballistic clip, while a Mercury Bow (a sniper railgun sans scope) only two. Combined with the limited availability of clips, this adds a strategic element to the game, as the player can only carry a weapon at a time, so if a powerful weapons runs out of ammo, the player must choose between keeping the weapon and fight hand to hand with the enemies until Konoko finds fresh ammo clips, or discard it for a lesser gun that uses different ammo. However, if the player runs out of ammo completely when facing a tough challenge, Konoko can "overdose" on hypo sprays (used to heal damage) by using them over her natural health bar, which provides her with faster movement and tougher blows.

Besides the blue hedgehog, there is "Tails", a yellow fox that can fly by rotating his two tails, and Knuckles, a red echidna that can climb walls.

Description=Osmos is a game where the player controls a substance in an enclosed environment, reminiscent of flOw. By touching smaller objects, they can be absorbed, merging to create a larger substance. The substance is controlled through the mouse with a mechanism similar to the classic Asteroids. The mouse is used to choose a direction and gentle clicks, or holding the mouse button, provide acceleration in short bursts, steadily moving the object in a certain direction until touching a border or being slowed down by another object. Moving however causes to leave behind small droplets of fluid, rendering it smaller. When touching an object larger than itself, the player's substance gets absorbed.<br><br>The levels are set in enclosed environments where zooming can be done freely. After a few tutorials levels, different paths are offered based on variations on the concept. Some of them are based on aggressively tracking another organism or surviving in a crowded environment, another set is about an orbital course floating around a large object, and the final one is the slowest where there is very little space and the area needs to be captured with caution. In levels with limited manoeuvrability, time can be speed up or slowed down to prevent losing too much fluid when going slowly. Levels are usually won by capturing a specific organism (there are many, with different abilities) or growing to a certain size. In later levels antimatter is introduced, with the opposite effect or regular organisms.<br><br>The gameplay is supported by soothing, ambient electronic music.

Description=The land of the Obas, a peaceful race of strange multicolored creatures, is devastated by the powerful red wizard Garouba. The inhabitants are imprisoned on cages by the evil sorcerer, and must be liberated to reconstruct their home and bring it back to its former glory.<br><br>Oba: The Great Journey is a tile-matching game, where the objective is to release the Obas by making horizontal or vertical matches of three or more bricks of the same color, within a time limit. In the main game screen, the Oba prisoners stand on top of columns made of multicolored bricks. They can only escape when touching the ground, after the removal of all the columns tiles with matches. The bricks can switch position with adjacent tiles and be moved in this way to any part of the grid. Garouba keeps adding new brick rows every few seconds, pushing the pile upwards. If any Oba dies squished at the top, the game is over.<br><br>Power-up tiles appear randomly in the pile, and are activated by making adjacent matches. The bomb, marked with a radioactive sign, explodes tiles that are touching it. The row bomb, with two arrows pointing to opposite directions, removes six tiles horizontally. The column bomb, showing two arrows pointing up and down, eliminates 6 tiles vertically. The shuffle, indicated by two arrows in a circle, changes the position of all tiles. The rainbow bomb acts as a wildcard and can match any color. The color bomb blows up all tiles that share its color. The flattener reorganizes the pile in straight lines. The freeze tile prevents the addition of new rows for a few seconds. The hammer tile breaks individual blocks. The slow tile decreases Garouba's speed, making him less efficient in putting new tiles to the pile. The Oba shuffle moves all the prisoners to the lower empty columns.

The player controls an owl against a city landscape. The pigeons in the air can be attacked using swoops - dives that hurt the pigeons and cause them to drop down on the humans below (rewarded with an extra life). Swoops need to be recharged and successful attacks or combos are rewarded with points and additional levels. While flying, the owl needs to dodge lampposts that electrify the creature. After levelling up a few times, the owl is able to perform longer to continuous swoops, in circles moving downwards left or right, and powering up to achieve a larger radius of attack.<br><br>The owl starts with five lives.

Description=Passage is an experimental game/art/discussion piece. A large part of the appeal is in discovering exactly what it's about and what it might mean to you.<br><br>Briefly, though, it is a representation of the journey through life. Each game lasts five minutes, during which your character will grow older and finally die. It's up to you how you spend those five minutes. You can explore the endlessly scrolling gameworld alone, or with a partner. You can take an easy route (thereby getting 'further' but perhaps missing out on things along the way) or a less secure option; venturing deep into a maze of tunnels, in the hope of finding treasure. You have a score, which is affected in various ways by the choices you make, but the way you play is entirely up to you.

Description=The Path is an unconventional psychological horror game based on the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood and a French grandmother's tale from the 14th century. Described by the developers as a game about growing up, it consists of three acts that can be played with six different girls. To tell its story, the game uses the first-, second- and thirdperson perspective. As much of the game depends on surprise and exploration, the game's outline as described below can be considered heavy on spoilers.<br><br>The game starts inside a house where a mother can instruct one of her six daughters (Robin, Rose, Ginger, Ruby, Carmen and Scarlet, all aged nine to nineteen) to bring a basket with wine to grandmother's house. Players then control one the sisters as she walks down the path leading to the house. When players follow the road and enter the house, a chapter is completed, but rated poorly. To fully experience the game, the player eventually has to instruct the girls to leave the path and venture into the surrounding woods.<br><br>While exploring the woods, the graphics fade to a dim palette, with haunting sound effects and music (composed by Jarboe, formerly with the band Swans), and graphical patterns appearing as a screen overlay. There are no visible or invisible borders to the endless forest, and the girls need to find key locations (called attractions) and items they can pick up. Scattered around are abandoned objects that all bring about fragments of a story. The forest layout is randomized for each playthrough and sometimes only specific daughters can interact with an object in the environment. At the same time their different experiences are interwoven as they make remarks about past events. Items bring about memories and lines of text that subtly explain the girl's history and desire to leave the path and venture into the woods. The real meaning behind the game is largely left to the player's imagination, but many clues for interpretation are provided. In general, it may be a metaphor for the temptations in different stages in a teenager's girls life. The game sometimes takes over control, adding a black border around the screen, but never to take over decisions for the player or to lead him into a certain action.<br><br>Virtually no clues are provided while exploring the forest, and a map with the walked route only briefly appears after every 100 meters. The daughters are able to walk, and run, but the latter is largely discouraged through an in-game mechanic, making it a slow game in general. Players can also pick up up to 144 flowers that reveal a location for every six collected. It is not possible to fail in The Path, but conscious decisions by the players lead to events that cannot be reversed.<br><br>The game is controlled through the keyboard and the mouse, and actions are performed by letting go of the mouse. The game also uses a behaviour system called Drama Princess where a girl reacts with the environment when the players lets go of the controls, chosen randomly from a pool of possible actions in that scene. While playing, sequences, actions, items or characters also appear as a faded overlay over the left side of the screen. After completing the game once, it can be turned into a cooperative multiplayer game by plugging in a gamepad. There is an inventory, but rather as a reference than as a way to interact with the environment. The game does not contain voiced conversations, everything is conveyed through written text, gestures or actions.

Offering numerous categories and a lot of different questions, Trivia Gems brings this trivia game show to your computer.<br><br>There are 3 game modes to choose from.  The first mode chooses random categories and lets you pick your path to the top of a pyramid of questions.  In this mode, you can choose the difficulty by picking a day of the week, with Monday being the easiest and Friday being the hardest.  The difficulty determines how much money you can earn in a game as well as the difficulty of the questions.  On each level of the pyramid, you need to answer 3 questions within the given amount of time.  You then need to wager on those answers.  To move up to the next level, you need to win more than you lose in your wagers -- you can get 2 questions wrong, but if you wagered well, you could still move up.  During your way to the top, you will come across 2 bonus question "mini-games" where you could increase your winnings even more.  If you make it all of the way to the top, you will play a final 5-question round, where you could double your winnings.  Winning 5 games in a row qualifies you for a Championship game that is played the same way, but has more levels to complete.<br><br>The second mode is a short game version, where you only need to answer and wager on 10 questions.  You are then scored based on your answers and how much you wagered.<br><br>The final mode allows you to play against your friends.  In this mode, you work your way up the pyramid just as in the first mode, but there is only 1 question per level and if you get it right, you move up.  If you get it wrong, you move down.  The first person to the top wins.  If it's a tie, then the person with the most money at the end will win.

It was only released for the Macintosh, and left many waiting for a promised sequel for five years until 1997, when Heliotrope Studios put out Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain (also known as Pax Imperia 2) for both the Mac and Windows platforms (published by THQ and Atari respectively).<br><br>Pax Imperia was particularly beloved for its detail and complexity, in ways reminiscent of Microprose's Master of Orion series, Mare Crisium's Stars!, and Koei's series of empire-building strategy games.  It was also, sight virtually unseen in most such games, playable by up to sixteen human players.<br><br>GAMEPLAY<br><br>Noteworthy elements of gameplay aside from the usual fare for games of its ilk (i.e. starship combat and exploration, colony-building, economics, etc.) included:<br><br>Species customization with such features as specifiable atmosphere type (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon or hydrogen), temperature range and tolerance, and four percentile-rated attributes -- curiosity, efficiency, reproduction and aggression;<br>Detailed ship and ship systems design;<br>Detailed personnel management for your ministers/advisers (including selecting from a pool of candidates with varying attributes, attitudes and loyalty  la Koei's strategy games, such as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series);<br>Separate development and management of up to nine distinct regions of each planet;<br>Planetary surface operations (primarily raids, assaults and even the landing of hostile colonists into specific planetary regions of enemy-controlled planets);<br>Migration between planetary regions (even by another player's colonists, leading to "Migration Wars"!);<br>Five different mineral resources grouped into scientifically-valid categories (Ferrites, Pyrrites, Silicates, Crystals and Radiants) to find, mine and trade with other space civilizations;<br>Starships organized into and moved as fleets, not individual ships;<br>Espionage options that include bribing or assassinating enemy ministers; and<br>Detailed, custom research ("Tech Design") in which individual attributes of developed ship systems can customized (including, for example, a dynamic range/accuracy graph for weapons).<br><br>Anyone who has played later science fiction "4X" games -- and particularly Quicksilver Software's ambitious (and bugridden) Master of Orion III -- is likely to see that many  intriguing and complex aspects of gameplay, some of which may have seemed pioneering in a modern computer game industry environment in which simplicity is the order of the day, had already been seen years earlier in Pax Imperia.

Description=Peggle Nights, the sequel to Peggle, is more of an expansion pack than a full-featured new game. The gameplay remains exactly the same: the player controls a cannon at the top of the screen, that can turn 180 and shoot balls at a series of bricks or pegs that turn brighter when hit. The ball bounces around the screen and eventually falls down, making the touched bricks explode. The player has limited number of balls to clear all the orange pegs. A large bowl keeps moving at the bottom of the screen from one side to the other and, if the ball falls inside, it is saved and added to the remaining ones.<br><br>At the moment before the ball hits the last orange peg, the camera zooms in for a slow-motion close-up and Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" starts playing in the soundtrack. After that, the ball falls in one of the five bowls that cover the bottom of the screen, with bonus points ranging between 10,000 to 100,000 points.<br><br>In the Adventure Mode, the game is divided in 12 stages, each one with 5 levels and a different character. The character changes the power-up released by hitting the green bricks/pegs. For example, in the levels of the squirrel Jimmy Lighting, the power is multi-ball. In the Claude the lobster levels, it is a pair of claws that act like pinball flippers.<br><br>The Challenge Mode has 60 unique levels with specific goals. Five of the Challenge levels are only playable after completing 15 levels in the Adventure mode, while the remaining 55 levels are only accessible after completing it. In Quick Play the player can retry any completed levels, and in the Duel Mode two players can compete in hot-seat.

Some of the songs are used on cutscenes between each chapter. The player assumes the role of a police officer investigating a series of murders in Victorian England.<br><br>The gameplay follows the standards of the point-and-click genre, where the objective is to collect inventory objects scattered around the location, that have to be dragged and dropped on specific portions of the scene to solve puzzles or perform a necessary action. The cursor is context-sensitive, changing into a grabbing hand when over one of the items, a pointing hand when near one of the exit hotspots, a magnifying glass when hovering over a scenery portion with a zoom view, and a set of gears when passing over a place that needs one of the inventory objects. Each location is represented as a series of connected rooms or screens, where the player must move and click on the interactive portions. Some of the most important hotspots are highlighted with sparkles.<br><br>The hidden object sections take place on separate screens cluttered with assorted paraphernalia, where the goal is to find and click on all the items listed at the bottom. The hint lantern shows the position of one of the required objects, but takes some time to recharge after use. After finishing the seek-and-find scene, the player receives a new inventory object. Mini-games appear as well, where the player has to complete jigsaw puzzles, and manipulate mechanisms to solve them. The mini-games can be optionally skipped after a few minutes.

Description=Black Plague is the second major part of what was originally planned as the Penumbra trilogy. The story is picked up right after the events of the first game, where Philip travelled to Greenland to pursue a location the notes of his father describe. The game takes off deep inside the mines, in a complex known as The Shelter, built in the seventies by the Archaic Elevated Castle, an organization in pursuit of ancient knowledge. Philip gets to know more about the Tuurngait virus and the storyline is explained further through the events and notes left behind.<br><br>Gameplay is fairly identical to the original game. Philip has to gain access to different locations mostly by relying on his wit, in a survival horror setting. The environment is very dark and puzzles are more complex than similar games, requiring extensive object manipulation, combined with a realistic physics engine where the mouse is used to open drawers, turn valves on tools and throw or stack objects. As the original game was often criticized for the cumbersome close-combat, the sequel removes almost all offensive means, having the player use the environment to outwit enemies and run from them, and putting the focus almost entirely on the puzzle-solving aspect. Gameplay is also largely based on stealth and hiding in dark corners. The game is shown through a first-person perspective with a regular mode, and an interact mode to explore specific areas.<br><br>Important items are stored in an inventory, with quick slots. The player can take multiple hits and restore health through painkillers. The game uses fixed save points, represented as ancient objects. Where the first game introduced the character Red as a dubious radio sidekick, the second game makes interaction more complex, as Philip is contact with a certain Dr. Amabel Swanson as well as with Clarence, a conflicting voice inside his head as a second personality due to the effects of an infection. Clarence is able to cause effects such as dj vus (playable sequences), distorted reality and a lack of control over vision and movement.<br><br>Playing the first game is not required to follow the story, but many important plot elements are further explained or referenced. New to this game are a gas mask, the use of computer terminals to access information and gain access to new areas, and an additional button to rotate items more easily when holding them.

Description=Penumbra: Overture is a first-person survival horror game. Originally created as a tech demo to showcase the in-house developed HPL engine, the small team soon turned it into a full game, split up into two episodes (originally advertised as three), of which this is the first one.<br><br>Players take on the role of Philip. After his mother's death, he receives a letter of his father, a man he has never seen in his life and presumed dead. Philip is asked to destroy a set of notes, but instead he decides to travel to the wastelands of Greenland following the clues left in the writings. He ends up in an underground complex where he discovers disturbing facts about the past and events hidden from the rest of the world.<br><br>Unlike other survival horror games, Penumbra heavily focuses on adventure elements with physics-based and inventory-based puzzles, exploration, and a few action elements and scripted sequences, with a first-person perspective and mechanics similar to a first-person shooter. Players need to use the environment to operate items and machines, and build structures with items scattered around. Almost any item can be picked up and used as an active game element. Actions need to be performed through an appropriate motion with the mouse: hold and move left or right to swing a weapon, turn valves in a circular motion, pull back to open drawers and doors, etc.<br><br>Key items are stored in an inventory and need to be combined or used with objects to progress in the game. Clues and background information about the events are gathered through notes left behind and one-way conversations with a mysterious man called Red. Puzzles often require a lot of thinking, with both visual and auditive elements, and need thorough investigation of the environment. All notes are stored in a notebook and clues for puzzles and tasks are added a to do list.<br><br>Philip can collect weapons such as a hammer, a broom and a pick axe, but melee fighting is generally discouraged and rarely rewarded. Instead, players need to use the environment to set up inventive traps or avoid fighting altogether by using distractions or stealth to sneak past enemies. By hiding in the shadows, the edge of the screen turns blue and Philip stays hidden for all creatures. The environment is almost completely dark at all times, enhancing the horror experience. Light sources are very important, and Philip only has a flashlight with a limited amount of batteries, a glowstick and flares.<br><br>Next to a constant feeling of desolation, there are many disturbing events and horrifying elements, so the faint of heart need not apply. The game supports OpenAL sound.

The puzzles are all physics based and require the player to examine the environment, manipulate it and usually find a way to power the portal to move on to the next area.

The images of the worlds are made up of 120 screens assembled from 22,000 photographs, and each world features a Gabriel song and the artwork of one of four well-known fine artists, Nils-Udo, Yayoi Kusama, Cathy Monchaux, and Helen Chadwick, which gives each world its own unique look.<br><br>The puzzles are intuitive, the player has to look around and click on stuff to see what happens.  Buildings in each world, such as the Human Relations room and the art galleries, are common to each one and what you find will be determined by what you have interacted with in the scenes. The game has 80 minutes of video and 45 minutes of music to be discovered.<br><br>Many of the interactions are keys to sound loops to collect for three separate IMX (Interactive Musical Xperiences) in EVE  that strip down popular Gabriel tunes like "In Your Eyes," "Come Talk To Me" and "Shaking the Tree" to layers of tracks, riffs and dubs and let you goof around with reassembling them, recording your own mixes and translating them into animated videos. Background (or mood) music loops are like accompanying instruments, and flyins are the lead instruments or vocals. For each song there are 12 background loops and 18-21 flyins. Some are available by default, but many have to be found in the worlds of EVE.

Eeyore needs a little assistance mixing paints<br><br>There are more puzzles as you solve the first ones and look for your soup ingredients; to get the pepper from Owl you first have to put his spices in alphabetical order. To collect the milk, you have to cross a pond by jumping on lily pads and rocks, and once you've gotten Pooh across the Woozle Trap you'll need to put a broken honey pot together for him.

Description=Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.<br><br>Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.<br><br>Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

This game goes where no other has gone before and allows you to create and customize your very own pirate who can adventure and start their own crews from all the other online players in order to conquer the seas. <br><br>After being released from prison at the start by the infamous main protagonist "Captain" Jack Sparrow, he explains to the player that his beloved 18th century Caribbean world is under threat by a dangerous legion of undead pirates led by a new villain simply known as Jolly Roger. The player encounters Roger for the first time after they have been given their own sea chest, which contains all the useful items needed for the journey. Roger lets the player live and serve as a warning to Sparrow, who instead makes them walk the plank. Who knows what tricks this new and sinister villain is up to?<br><br>After the player swims to Port Royal (you don't control this part), this is where the game officially starts off.

Now you have to click on a group of at least three blocks of the same type to get them removed. If you remove more than three at once, you earn more points. But with each click, new items dropping in, filling more and more of the playfield. If you running out of possible combinations, you can redraw the playfield as many times you want, but each time will cost you points already earned.<br><br>On the other hand, it is an adventure game, where you play the pirate Captain Gingerbeard, who is on a quest to find Treasure Island. You will navigate from island to island, disabling enemy ships with your own ship, seize them and fighting the enemy crew on an one-on-one fight, including the enemy captain. You will attack enemy forts, trying to escape mazes, and gamble with the harbour master of neutral islands for replacements of your crew.<br><br>The clue about Pirates of Treasure Island is that you will play both games simultaneously!<br><br>The pirate adventure is the frame story of the game. For controlling your character, your ship, or your cannon, you will use the puzzle game.<br><br>As already said, you have four different types of blocks. So, besides that you actually getting points for the blocks you remove, you will also use them to manipulate the environment accordingly to your current situation.<br><br>In example, attacking enemy ships. You load your cannon by clicking a cannonball from the puzzle playfield. Your crew will then load the cannon for you. Now you have three different possible blocks you can use, one for the middle ship, one for the right ship, and one for the left ship. Your cannon will fire as soon as you click the block group of your choice. The fourth block group in this example will always miss the ships (shot in the water). While you are firing, the enemy ship(s) will firing too. On each second hit you will loose one of your ten crewmen (first shot wounds him only) and a part of your playfield will drop from the screen.<br><br>The problem is now, that the game runs in real-time. So, while you may still try to find a proper block group in the huge puzzle field, the enemy ships will continue firing normally, regardless if you fight or not. Or, on the worst case, when you fighting the enemy captain, you must parry his attacks with a proper block group, or you will instantly loose your crewman, who is fighting for you.

The basic gameplay has similar mechanics to the Build-a-lot series. After selecting one of the buildings or vacant lots, upgrade and build options appear on the interface at the bottom. Most of the screen shows one of the city's districts in isometric graphics, with the goals of each level displayed at the top in the main campaign mode, along with the timer and three meters showing the current level of the mayor's popularity, citizens' satisfaction and environment health. The cost of everything is paid with tax revenues, collected at the end of each "day" (that takes about a minute). Extra electric energy generated by the ecological grid can be sold to increase the funds. Materials have to be purchased for the upgrades and constructions.<br><br>The upgrades change according to the building function, and some are only available after creating one of the district additions, like bicycle tracks and recycling centers. Residences can be upgraded to be more eco-friendly, by converting the lamps to fluorescent ones, installing solar panels, creating a garden, applying thermal insulation paint, constructing a rainwater reclamation system and starting to recycle trash. Other buildings have some of these upgrades and specific ones. Business buildings can start using bicycles as transportation. Farms can adopt more organic and efficient practices.<br><br>Buildings are constructed by selecting a vacant lot, and choosing one of the available blueprints. Some buildings only become available after research, performed in a separate tab. Certain spaces are reserved to district upgrades, and can't be used to build directly. Parks and recreation areas can only be built in terrains full of vegetation. Existing buildings can be demolished, and part of their materials recycled and reclaimed for others.<br><br>In the main campaign mode, the objective is to achieve all goals listed at the top as fast as possible. In the free play mode, there are no goals and the player can continue from the district progress made in the campaign mode, or start from scratch.

Description=Plants vs. Zombies belongs to the "tower defense" sub-genre of casual games, where the objective is to deploy a series of stationary weapons to protect a structure against hordes of enemies. Plants provide the artillery, and can be bought with sun power, the game's currency. The enemies are zombies invading a suburban lawn. At the start of each level, the player starts to plant the available seeds on the lawn in a strategic manner. Zombies slowly begin to appear from the street at the right side, just a few initially, and must be destroyed before they can reach the house on the other side. Sun power icons falls from the sky randomly, and must be collected with the mouse to increase the funds. The sunflower can be planted to generate extra units of sun power, but doesn't have any attack power against the invading undead. Besides their cost, the seed packs take some time to recharge after being used.<br><br>There are several types of offensive plants available. Pea shooters are the basic variety, spitting a projectile forwards every few seconds. Variations appear later in the game, shooting several peas at the same time and freezing the enemies, making them move slower. The carnivorous plant gobbles up a zombie when he gets near its gaping mouth, but takes some time to do so, becoming ineffective while busy digesting the corpse. The cherry bomb explodes after being deployed, carbonizing any of the undead surrounding its landing spot. The potato mine is half-buried with a sensor sticking from the top, and detonates when one of the walking dead steps on it. Plants can be removed with the shovel to make space for new ones.<br><br>Mini-games appear from time to time. There are twenty of them, and most are parodies of well-known casual titles: ZomBotany (1 and 2), Wall-nut Bowling (1 and 2), Slot Machine, It's Raining Seeds, Beghouled, Invisi-ghoul, Seeing Stars, Zombiquarium, Beghouled Twist, Big Trouble Little Zombie, Portal Combat, Column Like You See 'Em, Bobsled Bonanza, Zombie Nimble Zombie Quick, Whack a Zombie, Last Stand, Pogo Party, and Dr. Zomboss's Revenge. After being played once, they become available directly from the main menu.<br><br>The game has three gameplay modes. In the main adventure mode, levels get progressively more difficult, and at the end of each one the player receives a new plant for the arsenal. Puzzle mode has two variations: "Vasebreaker", where the goal is to break the vases scattered on the lawn, to uncover plants or zombies and use the former to fight the latter, and "I, Zombie", where the player controls the zombies against the plants. In survival mode, the zombies attack in turns. After each turn, the player can choose plants from the arsenal. There are three types of survival: normal (one wave per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, hard (two waves per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, and endless (two waves per turn, endless amount of turns) on the pool map.<br><br>The Zen Garden stores all the available plants, where they have to be tended, watered, fertilized, sprayed for bugs and listen to music.

Description=Pocahontas: Princess of the Powhatan is a hidden object game based on the life of the famous XVII century historical figure, a native woman that helped relations between North American tribes and European explorers, and eventually married a British man and moved with her husband to England, living there for the rest of her life. As usual, the objective is to find and click on all the objects listed at the left side of the screen, on locations filled with scattered items. A hint button shows the exact position of one of the required objects, but takes some minutes to recharge after use.<br><br>The plot is shown as cutscenes appearing between the hidden object sessions. No effort was made to achieve any degree of historical accuracy, as anachronistic and modern items can be found on most locations, and the script makes clear deviations from the recorded accounts. Some puzzles appear occasionally on separate screens, where the player has to guide Pocahontas out of a forest labyrinth or assemble jigsaw puzzles.

At the beginning you may select one of two funny looking figures and the game begins. Your "pogo sticker" is entirely mouse-controlled; by moving the mouse to his left or right, you make him pitch into a direction, and pressing the mouse button increases the force of your next jump by a certain amount. Each time you touch the floor you jump off again depending on your pitch and jump force.<br><br>There are two things to take care of: First, you have to keep jumping -- if you have not enough energy, you'll have to restart the level. Second, take care of your head! It can only take a limited amount of damage.<br><br>Your little pogo sticker now has to complete twelve levels as quickly as possible. The levels are colourful and varied, starting out very easy to get used to the controls, but quickly increasing in difficulty, including dangers like low ceilings, steep falls, slippery ice, sandy pits  etc.<br><br>Controlling the pogo sticker turns out to be quite challenging, requiring delicate positioning and good timing. It's easy to overdo it, resulting in the little jumper wildly bouncing around and eventually hitting his head somewhere. <br><br>There is no high score table. Instead, you get lollipops of different colors if you complete a level under a given time.

Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.<br><br>When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.<br><br>But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. <br><br>And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.

Description=Ever have one of those days?<br><br>Postal 2 is the sequel to Postal, the gritty, violent, over-the-top game that was the target of almost every politician's speech about violence in video games.  If they were ticked at that one, wait until this one is on their desk.<br><br>Once again, you take on the role of Postal Dude, a normal (comparatively normal, anyway) guy living in Paradise, Arizona.  The game is composed of a five day week, Monday to Friday, where you must accomplish various errands.  There is no time limit, and errands can be done whenever you feel like it.  Errands range from getting a carton of milk (buying it or stealing it, your choice) to cashing your cheque at the bank (either wait in line or kill everyone, again your choice).<br><br>The game is "as violent as you are", meaning you can go through the majority of the game without killing someone or beating up someone, but you can also go through it killing and decapitating every one you come across.<br><br>For your killing needs, you have a plethora of ways to dispatch people.  You can kick them, urinate on them (making them vomit), shoot them, bash them with a shovel, throw gas on them and set them ablaze, leaving behind a charred corpse, and if you want to be stealthy, you can pick up a cat, and stick your shotgun into's it rear end to use it as a silencer.  Every time you shoot now, fur will go flying.  One of the more novelty, and very over the top weapons, is a decapitated cow's head filled with anthrax, which will cause everyone in the immediate area to gag, throw up, then die.<br><br>Postal 2 uses the Unreal Warfare engine, and comes packed with the Warfare editor, allowing you to create new people, levels, or even entire mods.<br><br>As a special treat, Gary Coleman is in the game, and you must get his autograph as one of your errands.  Of course, you don't have to; you can beat him or kill him instead.  As Gary himself says, "Shoot me, kill me, it's only a game".<br><br>Postal 2 is not recommended for children or those seeking political careers.

Description=Apocalypse Weekend begins on the Saturday following the climactic Apocalypse at the end of Postal 2. As the shiftless Postal Dude bounces from one deadbeat mission-based job to another in order to earn enough money to buy back his repossessed dog and trailer home, he finds that his self-inflicted gunshot head-wound is causing him to have periodic visions of a bizarre, grotesque parallel universe where the walls are made of flesh and blood and where he comes under constant attack from mummified demonic children that look suspiciously like Gary Coleman. Could there be some connection between Postal Dude's visions, the evil video game publisher Whiptail Interactive, the recent mysterious mad-cow induced zombie outbreak, and the U.S. War on Terror? Has Postal Dude's brain trauma given him the ability to see the hidden machinations of some bovine Ultimate Evil attempting to bring about the very End of the World? Or is it just a bunch of random elements some pea-brained level designers strung together on a shoe-string budget? Only the Postal Dude can find the truth.<br><br>Apocalypse Weekend is the single player expansion pack for the controversial first-person murder simulator, Postal 2. Unlike the original Postal 2, which was a free-roaming, exploration-based game similar to the Grand Theft Auto series,  Apocalypse Weekend is a linear, mission-based game that takes the player from one pre-set level to the next. Apocalypse Weekend is also much more combat-oriented than the original Postal 2, and unlike Postal 2 it is virtually impossible to complete the game without killing, as several of the game's later missions involve the Postal Dude running through narrow corridors while being bombarded by wave after wave of hostile machine-gun-wielding attackers.<br><br>Apocalypse Weekend features:<br>10 new "story-based" missions taking place across 20 new maps over the course of 2 days (Saturday and Sunday), culminating in a climactic battle for the very fate of humanity (aka an oddly out-of-place boss battle that even the game admits was apparently thrown in just for the heck of it).<br><br>3 new melee weapons: A machete, a sledgehammer, and a scythe, all of which are capable of killing enemies in a single hit and even of severing limbs and cutting enemies in half.<br><br>Several new enemies, including: Experimental Tazmanian Devil cats, homicidal Gary Coleman demons, and the ubiquitous Mad Cow Tourette zombies. <br><br>A new damage modeling system that allows you to dismember your enemies by hacking off their arms and legs.

Description=Prince of Persia once again resets the timeline of the series and marks the start of a new trilogy with the Prince on the search for Farah, his donkey, which is loaded with treasures beyond imagining. But after an sandstorm he falls down into a canyon and meets Elika, a princess with magical powers. She's being hunted by the army of her father and has to make her way to the temple beneath the tree of life.<br><br>But they come too late. After a brief fight against her father, he breaks the seal and by doing so unlocks the prison chamber that was kept closed by the powers of the Tree of Life. The inhabitant of that prison? Ahriman - God of Darkness. Creator of the darkness of space and the first to unleash envy and hate. Back in the days he was not satisfied with keeping only one half of the universe and after a fierce battle against his brother Ormazd, God of Light, he almost won. In a last attempt Ormazd successfully lured Ahriman into the Tree of Life, condemning him to a thousand years of pain. But Ahriman was only waiting. Waiting and planning and now that he is free, he and his minions are beginning to claim back what they lost and the only two people on the world to stop them are the Prince and Elika.<br><br>The basic gameplay remains the same as in the previous trilogy with the Prince engaging in sword fighting, wall climbing, spike dodging, puzzle solving, and more, in his quest to save the world. But opposed to the previous trilogy, the Prince neither can rewind time nor has to fight multiple enemies at a time. Instead he and Elika only face one, strong enemy every time and if the Prince is about to die because of a miscalculated jump or anyhing similar, she uses her powers and sets the Prince back to the beginning of the jumping puzzle. That is not the only thing she does. By command of the player, she also helps in fights, allows him to jump further distances by giving him a little push in the back in mid-air and shows which way to go next. Elika is also the key to bring the Tree of Life back to full strength. But to do so, she needs so-called "Seeds of Life" that are scattered all around the levels. If the player has collected enough of these, Elika will also become stronger.<br><br>Besides the enemies being stronger, more intelligent and having more special abilities, the fights play similar to the previous iterations of the series with the Prince slashing away at enemies with his sword or his gauntlet in to produce powerful combos. The gauntlet also allows the prince to slide down from solid rocks safely to the area below. The game features Quick Time Events when an enemy got a hold on the Prince and uses a cel-shaded and heavily stylized look for the characters.

The main objective is to collect several key objects from the castle grounds, to solve puzzles and free the castle folk. The castle can be explored in a typical point-and-click manner, where each location is represented by an static image of the scenery, and the player moves from room to room by clicking on the exit hotspots, usually placed over obvious and logical areas like doors and entrances.

Mirror shards have to be inserted in one of the empty frames at the grand hall, and reassembled as jigsaw puzzles to liberate one of the captive souls.

After solving all the pending puzzles, the room is restored to its pristine condition.<br><br>One unique feature is the fairy assistant. She is the hint button, flying towards one of the required items when selected, and can also perform a series of special actions. She gradually learns new abilities that can be used to reveal hidden objects and solve puzzles. With the rock ability, she can break small containers like bottles and vases. The flame ability can be used to light something on fire, or attack an enemy. The wind ability blows away dust and other deposits, often revealing some obscured item. The water ability can be used to nourish plants. The hint option take some time to recharge after use, and becomes a skip option when playing one of the puzzles.

Three different platform types also add to the puzzles: Grass, sand, and ice.  On grass, objects such as crates and barrels can be pushed freely. On sand, they'll get stuck or move more slowly. On ice, the professor will keep sliding until he hits something and comes to a stop.<br><br>Navigating the levels is challenging, but you're often given power-ups to help you on your way. The Frost Gun, for example, will allow you to freeze any object (including the Rage-Bots!) so that the object can slide more easily on grass and sand.  The E.M.P. power-up is helpful for disabling Rage-Bots, and for disconnecting magnets.

Clocks abound and floating telephone receivers on tree-like stiff cords, televisions showing static, and airplane kaleidoscopes.  In one room with a maze of chairs, Anderson steps out waving flashlights like a runway attendant and recites the legend of Plato's Cave - where prisoners are doomed never to see the true images of things but only to glimpse their fleeting shadows. In another room, she gives a long palm-reading session asking many questions of the player, and in yet another there is "The Amazing Ouija Floor Board" where you get to ask the questions.

Description=As a citizen of the kingdom of Bartonia, it's your job to discover why the Undead have begun swarming all over the world of Etheria. In this RPG hybrid you'll be following the story of your character as they rid Etheria of the Undead scourge and save Bartonia, complete sidequests for extra money, experience, items and companions, craft your own weapons and armor, capture monsters for use as mounts or to learn their spells, and even lay siege to neighboring kingdoms in order to add them to your own empire. However, Puzzle Quest is an RPG with a twist. Everything is done (as the name implies) with puzzles.<br><br>Everything in Puzzle Quest is done with puzzles. The puzzles themselves are similar to Bejeweled in execution, with a few slight variations used for things like item crafting and enemy capture.<br><br>When fighting an enemy (which can range from zombies to orcs and even castle strongholds, each with their own special spells and abilities), you both take turns using the same board. The goal is to reduce your opponents hitpoints to zero, which can be done directly by linking up skulls in rows of three or more, or by using spells which require mana. To build up mana, just link three or more runes of the same color together, just like the skulls. Every time you gain mana, it's stored in your reserves until you use it (or are hit with a mana draining attack). Gold and experience are built up in the same way, using gold coins or purple experience orbs that occupy the same board and can be linked just like runes and skulls.<br><br>The real strategy behind the game comes into play when you factor in elemental mastery (gaining extra mana when linking runes for a specific element), equipment (which can prevent damage, drain mana and more), spells (which can poison, drain mana, stun and so on) and linking up groups of four or more. The reason groups of four are important is that every time a row of four-of-a-kind is created, you get an extra turn. While it doesn't sound important, getting four runes in a row could possibly give you enough mana to cast an extremely powerful spell and give you the extra turn to cast it before your enemy can even move.<br><br>There is also a direct action mode in which players can hone their skills against various opponents independent from the story mode, as well as wireless multi-card play where two players can square off using their own characters from the campaign mode.

Or on the other side, you can play it more like an "action" game, were you play against the time. And if you dont play it at an easy difficulty, you dont have time to think there.<br><br>Once you start a game, you will be presented with your playfield, which consists of 4x4 or up to 14x14 QBz. There are three different colors available (in easy difficulty), four in normal, and five in hard. Now all you need to do is to click on any of the QBz, which has at least one of the same color adjacent (horizontal or vertical). Then these specific QBz will vanish and you score, but the more of them you can remove at the same time, the better you score. If you try to remove a single QB, you get a penalty of 1000 points (removed). Once all possible combinations are gone, the level is completed. Now you get bonus points depending on how many percent of the playfield you cleared, if you cleared them all, you will see a special Perfect Clear sequence. <br><br>To help you on your mission, you have three buttons at your control. Two of them will rotate the QBz in the playfield, either left or right. The other button will randomize them all.

Description=An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.<br><br>id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.<br><br>In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.<br><br>Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.<br><br>The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.<br><br>Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

Description=Quake 4 is the true sequel to Quake II, continuing the Strogg vs. Humans storyline from the point where Quake II ended. The Strogg is an alien cyborg race which, much like the Star Trek Borg race from which they seem to be partly inspired, wander the galaxy conquering planets and wiping civilizations. Their sole purpose is to collect organic body parts with which to swell their ranks. After a prolonged war, the united armed forces of Earth decided to launch a desperate counter attack on the home planet of the invaders, Stroggos. By some twist of fate a sole marine was able to disable the Strogg main planetary defense (aka The Big Gun) and kill Makron, their leader. That was the end of Quake II. The second wave of attack is meant to land on Stroggos and take advantage of the brief disorder, ending the threat of the Strogg forever. Of course it will not be that easy...<br><br>This time the lone soldier theme (of Quake I, II and the Doom series) is replaced by a war. Not as large scale as a military FPS or even Halo, but close enough. There are squad mates, some of which are important to protect, some vehicles (a hovertank and a mech) and frequently changing objectives to achieve. The arsenal contains elements from all Quake games (nailgun, rail gun, lightning gun) and the classic BFG has been replaced by the Dark Matter Gun. Weapons can be improved later in the game, making them much more effective. The game uses a somewhat improved version of the Doom 3 engine to good effect. Multiplayer options are rather limited, offering only the standard Deathmatch modes and CTF.<br><br>Quake 4 was developed by Raven under the guidance of id Software.

Description=The third game in the Quake series is a departure from the previous games, focusing exclusively on multiplayer arena fighting with no story-driven singleplayer part - directly competing with Epic Games that did the same with the contemporary Unreal Tournament.<br><br>The offline part takes the player through a number of one-on-one and team-based challenges against AI-controlled opponents, slowly ranking upwards in difficulty, as the character of the player's choosing. Compared to the previous titles, the colours and general design of the game are much brighter and it shakes off the dominant shades of brown and grey the previous titles in the series were known for. The player's arsenal consists of new and familiar, but redesigned weapons, including a gauntlet (melee attacks) and a machine gun as the spawn weapons, a shotgun, plasma gun, lightning gun, rocket launcher, railgun and BFG. Each weapon has specific advantages, ranging from the amount of damage to reloading times and the ability to hit-scan opponents.<br><br>The different arenas are also filled with health bubbles, complete sets of armour and armour shards, the well-known Quad Damage power-up, ammunition, and specials such as Mega Health, Haste, Invisibility, a powerful Battlesuit, and more. As with the other Quake games, it is known for its freedom in movement. Advanced players using techniques such as rocket jumping, strafing and circle jumping to quickly get around areas. The game offers more speed than Quake 2, but it is not as fast as the original Quake. Not everything was kept - the double jumping from the previous titles was removed for instance, but replaced with new tricks.<br><br>The singleplayer part only serves as a diversion for the online multiplayer options, with modes such as duel, team deathmatch (TDM), capture the flag (CTF) and more. As with Quake II, the vanilla version of the game was eventually heavily tweaked by the players' community with all-new tournament features (including voting, referees, banning, netcode updates), as it was used in professional Pro Gaming tournaments for almost ten years.

Description=Quantz is a 3D color matching game. The player controls a rotating geometric shape floating at the center of the screen, peppered with small multi-colored spheres called Quantz on each face. New spheres keep appearing from the screen edges and falling towards the structure, and the objective is to turn the whole polyhedron to make them land on clusters of three or more globes of the same color, to make them disappear. When one of the balls is completely enclosed by a cluster of spheres, it can turn into a fireball after the surrounding balls are matched and removed. The fireball takes off the surface, and falls back burning clusters that share its color, creating new fireballs and giving combo points. Most of the balls are free-ranging, and react to the simulated physics by bouncing around and moving about the surface. Abrupt movements can send the spheres flying off the shape for a few seconds, but its gravity eventually pulls them back. This behavior can be exploited to solve some of the puzzles.<br><br>The game has three modes. In the strategy mode, the objective is to clear all the Quantz before all the energy runs out. The extra spheres are lined up on a ramp at the bottom of the screen, and the player shoots them towards the shape by pressing a button. In the puzzle mode, there's a limited amount of balls available, and the player must plan carefully where to deploy them to clear all the Quantz. The action mode is unlocked after completing ten levels of the puzzle mode, and is similar to the strategy mode. The main difference is the way the globes appear automatically hurling towards the surface, adding a more frenetic pace to the gameplay. The language can be selected from seven options: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian and Japanese.

Description=The Ultor Corporation of Mars is successful because of the mineral wealth of that planet. It employs a number of miners and scientists to mine the Noachite ores far underground. The miners are constantly pressured by the guards to work harder and faster, while at the same time being forced to share their meager resources. While the mines itself are dangerous, so too is the mysterious plague that has broken out among the ranks of miners, killing many. Into this low morale situation, propaganda against Ultor has begun appearing, signed only by "Eos". These pamphlets and posters urge the miners to rise up against their oppressors and take a stand, also recruiting members into their secretive "Red Faction". As a result of Eos' efforts, tensions are rising high between the Ultor corporation and it's workers, any little incident could ignite...<br><br>Red Faction is a first-person shooter and adventure game. Players take the role of Parker, a miner working underground for the Ultor Corporation.

At times, Parker also needs to travel undercover in more a lesser protective disguise. Parker defends himself with a variety of weapons, most which feature a primary and secondary firing mode. The weapons are divided into: hand weapons such as riot shields and flamethrowers, light arms which include pistols and shotguns, heavy arms featuring rocket launchers and sub-machine guns and finally weapons that are thrown or placed such as grenades and explosives. The game features a variety of vehicles to drive in first-person; including jeeps, drillers, flying craft and submarines.

Players are able to at multiple points, create their own paths,  tunneling past obstacles and into new environments. Only heavy explosives; such as missiles, torpedoes, grenades and plastique will allow the terrain destruction of this sort.

In fact, it uses the same Build engine as Duke Nukem 3D.<br><br>Redneck Rampage also has a singularly unique setting... instead of taking place in an alien installation or secret government facility, the game is set in the backwater small town of Hickston, Arkansas. <br><br>It seems that a bunch of tabloid leather-fetish cyborg aliens have abducted the town's stereotypical redneck inhabitants and cloned them. The aliens have also abducted Bessie, the prize pig of brothers Leonard and Bubba. As Leonard you'll have to fight the local yokel clones as well as the aliens throughout Hickston to rescue your pig. <br><br>The 'Redneck' theme is used very heavily. Levels range from trailer parks to chicken processing plants, and the arsenal of odd weapons include a gun that shoots circular saws, a TNT crossbow, and even a machine gun bra. Also, instead of armor and health kits, you restore health and become tougher by drinking whisky and eating pork rinds. But if you drink too much you go into "drunk mode" with blurred vision and stumbling movement.

Only by solving their puzzles and using keen senses of observation and logic can any explorer, such as yourself, find the way through the series of tunnels, secret passageways and hidden rooms.<br><br>The brothers Zetais and Kales have been trying to explore the ruins and get further into its depths. They are convinced that there are treasures to be found and need your help to find them. Your initial task in this 3rd game is to locate a "black gem" and a "secret library", both of which are deep within the compound. The ruins are abandoned and neither brother is on-site. You will investigate alone with only occasional contact with the explorers by videophone.<br><br>The game is played totally in first person and controlled by mouse, with no support for keyboard input except for the "ESCape" key. This game uses Flash technology for motion and features stereo music and sound effects.

Description=This game is the successor to Ricochet Xtreme. It's a Breakout variant, so you have your little ship (the paddle) at the bottom of the playfield, which initially shoots a ball, and then reflect it back into the playfield. Your mission is to destroy all bricks in the game. Once all are removed, you proceed to the next level.<br><br>Unique (at least I didn't saw it elsewhere) about the bricks is, that there are not only fixed and straight moving bricks, but there is also "vibration" in some levels. In example in the Underwater World, bricks will swing in complex patterns, both up/down or left/right, some of them even "fly" more chaotic.<br><br>The game offers 4 different main worlds (like Underwater, Volcano, or an Alien world) with 4 sub-worlds each. Each of the sub-worlds have 10 levels, so you can play 160 different levels. There are 4 different difficulty settings available.<br><br>On your journey through the game, you encounter lots of usual Power-Ups, like Small/Big Ball, Slow/Fast Ball, Catcher (to prevent loosing the ball), Multiball, 8-Ball, Laser equipped paddle, the all destroying ball (here it's the corrosive ball). But there also Power-Ups to create new balls (not through multiplying), Power-Ups that change the type of other bricks. Or how about a laser firing ball? But there are much more things in the game.

Description=A typical adventure game in the Myst-style (static rendered backgrounds that switch as you take each 'step'), Riddle of the Sphinx places you in the role of a close friend of Sir Gil Blythe Geoffreys, an archaeologist who as recently uncovered some remarkable finds about the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx. His discoveries have doomed him with a curse, however, and its your duty to right the wrongs he has uncovered. Taking place in the near future (after the Egpytian Antiquities Organization apparently closed off the sites to the public), you will uncover secrets that have been buried for ten millenia. <br><br>Rendered in 3-D, the game tries to reasonably copy the sites and monuments surrounding the Sphinx and the Pyramids of the Giza Plateau, allowing you to explore the area without ever leaving your chair, much less sweat out the heat of the desert. Gameplay consists of moving the cursor around, taking note of the highlights that can be selected, which include walking in directions and picking up/using items. Occassionally, you'll be treated a Quicktime VR panoramic scene that will allow you to freely turn and look around, but the majority of the game is static views that allow you to take 'steps' of varying sizes in different directions. Those familiar with games like the original Myst should feel at home. <br><br>The puzzles are fairly easy to an experienced gamer and the game tends to emphasize exploration of well-rendered ancient Egyptian structures and their passageways, both real and fabricated.

Description=Sam & Max 301: The Penal Zone is the first episode of the third Sam & Max season named Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse. In the beginning of the game Max finds a toy which causes a vision of the future: Sam & Max defeat an evil space gorilla by banishing him to the so-called &quot;Penal Zone&quot;. After the vision ends the gorilla's spaceship land on the street and he pretends to trade his advanced technology for an artifact - of course the one Max found. Only Sam & Max know his true intentions and they need to stop him...<br><br>The main new feature are Max's psychic powers which can be activated by clicking an icon on the upper right corner. Then the game switches to a first person where Max chooses and uses one of these powers. Besides the tutorial there are two available: teleport to a known phone (mostly used to save walking time) and predicting the future. When using the last power on a person or item a short clip gets played which shows the near future. This mostly results in a more or less obvious puzzle hint. During the episode Sam & Max also get access to a &quot;crime computer&quot;: they need to feed it two related pieces of evidence to get a new location. <br><br>The rest of the gameplay is similar to the former seasons: the player walks through the levels, collects items and uses them to solve puzzles. Dialogues are a ring menu similar to Mass Effect where the player only chooses the topic instead of the whole sentence. Unlike traditional adventure games the movement of Sam is not controlled by point & click but by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse in the desired direction (or alternatively with the keyboard keys). Interactions with items or persons are carried out with a single mouse button.<br><br>Like the Tales of Monkey Island series single episodes weren't available for purchase at the initial release.

KING.)<br><br>At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace.  However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger.<br><br>Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves.  Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies.  If, after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled!<br><br>Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death.  All the more reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you've got, while you've got it.

Description=Sarah Maribu and her brother Michael are two archaeologists and explorers, that arrive by helicopter to an uncharted island and start to investigate the temples and other structures of a lost civilization.<br><br>Sarah Maribu and the Lost World is a hidden object game with elements of the adventure genre. Most of the time, the objective is to find and click on all the items shown as pictures on slots at the left side of the screen, on locations filled with assorted paraphernalia scattered throughout the scenery. The hint button shows the position of one of the required items, but takes thirty seconds to recharge after use. Some of the objects are stored inside the inventory, to be used later when solving puzzles.<br><br>The inventory can be accessed through the tools button at the bottom-left corner, sliding upwards to reveal all of its compartments. The objects have to be used as in most point-and-click adventures, by dragging and dropping them over logical places to perform an action or complete a task. Some of the objects can only be found inside one of the interactive windows showing another angle of the location, that appear after clicking on certain hotspots.<br><br>There are mini-games between each chapter, like the Simon implementation where the player has to repeat a color sequence in a set of drums, the weights puzzle where statuettes have to be distributed on columns to reach equilibrium, and other similar challenges.

Description=In this second Magic School Bus game based on the educational book series from Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen, Ms. Frizzle and her class take a trip inside classmate Arnold's body. From Arnold's head to his toe, the group travels through every system, including the Upper and Lower Digestive System, the Circulatory System, the Respiratory System, Liver, Nervous System and the skin. Only when all the areas and 12 body parts have been visited can the class leave Arnold's body through one of three natural exits.<br><br>All actions in this game are performed with the mouse. In the classroom, selecting the skeleton brings up a game of reassembling its bones; clicking on the science projects on the other side of the room trigger animations. <br><br>Once the bus is selected, the journey begins as the miniaturized vehicle zooms into Arnold's mouth. The player navigates through his body by clicking the steering wheel and selecting directional signs from the bus windshield; each place will lead to at least one other, and all lead to the nervous system from where any section can be visited. On the lower left sits Liz, the class mascot, who can be clicked for help. Clicking the rear view mirror takes the player to the back of the bus, where he can choose Tim's knapsack to access a drawing program, or Ralphie's handheld to play a game related to the current body part. As the player journeys through the body the places he has visited are recorded on a map in the glove box as well as stamped in a travel log, so he can see what has been missed. Unlike later Magic School Bus games, the player is unable to exit the bus, all the action takes place inside and in the classroom.

At each stop the player can access activities, reports and experiments related to that zone by clicking on items nearby. There are also a number of zone-themed minigames that utilize both the mouse and the arrow keys. Among them are:<br><br>1. Crab Chase - the player must click to move a crab around on the beach and collect food while avoiding a predatory seagull.<br><br>2.

Zones may be visited in any order. Once the player has collected enough clues and travels to the area where the treasure is buried, he will find a treasure scanner to uncover it, and the game is won.<br><br>This game is suggested for ages 6 - 10, and the educational focus is on scientific exploration and experimentation, rather than simple fact-finding.

Using rarer letters score more points.  Longer words score bonuses.  Making at least 4-letter words starts a combo counter which acts as a multiplier for each word's score.<br><br>Timed mode gives the player a limited amount of time to come up with as many words as possible.  Each time the player submits a valid word, he/she is given a new set of seven letters.  Each submission is counted as a round and the round time decreases constantly until the player only has 5 seconds per round.  When the player fails to come up with a word within the round time, he/she loses a try.  Lose all the tries and the game ends, the player is scored and the score is entered into the high scores if it is indeed high.<br><br>Countdown mode gives a more relaxed flavor to the game.  The player is given no time limit for each round, however there are a limited number of word submissions before the game ends.<br><br>Replace mode leaves the letters the player didn't use for his/her word and replaces them with new letters.

Description=Tandrien has a problem: The evil Lord Wolvering is conquering the land and no one seems to be able to stop him. No one? Of course not. Princess Zo is tasked by her father to stop the Lord and once again reunite the country under one crown. And Zo does as she's told - but not for the good of the people. Instead she finally wants to become a Queen herself. The resulting peace is just a bonus.<br><br>As opposed to the previous two, more RTS-oriented iterations of the series, The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom returns in its core to the gameplay mechanics of the very successful second part of the series, The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici. Still, the game features several deviations and changes to the original gameplay mechanics and is very much multiplayer-oriented. Even the 12 mission long single player campaign, in which the player helps Zo reunite Tandrien, is more of a really long tutorial for the multiplayer-matches, slowly introducing the players to the game.<br><br>The player once again starts with an almost empty sector, only containing a castle, a warehouse, a construction building and a tavern. The latter is used to recruit soldiers and additional generals in exchange for gold and foot. As opposed to the starting general, recruited generals give additional bonuses like an advantage against defense towers. But before the player needs to thing about that, he needs to start building up a working economy with the resources he has available in his castle and the ones he can find in his first sector. As most parts of the series, this involves building production cycles like placing a lumberjack near a forest to cut wood, building a sawmill to produce planks out of it and using those planks to build other buildings and production lines. In addition a forester can keep the forest from vanishing. But instead of placing each production building individually, the player now only places one of six main types of buildings and adds on up to three production facilities to it. For example the apartment building not only increases the population limit, but is also required to build a butcher or a tailor. Although this allows the player to build entire production cycles on a small strip of land, the workers in the buildings won't bring their wares directly to the next in line. Instead they get their resources from the nearest warehouse and bring their product there themselves. And in order to do that, once again walkways need to be build, connecting each building.<br><br>Once the economy is stable and the wares keep flowing, its a good idea to build a higher level structure including the barracks, the church and the trading guild. These are required to build the corresponding units as well as to get fast access to prestige-points. These prestige points are invested into a small prestige tree which in turn first unlocks access to these higher level structures and then allows the player to upgrade these buildings to get be able to build higher level units or gain the ability to upgrade his streets for faster travel or his defenses to make it harder for the enemy to get inside and destroy the castle (the ultimate victory condition).<br><br>Back in the day, destroying the enemy castle was the only way to win a game. Now its the most cumbersome way. Instead the players compete for victory points. These are earned for certain milestones like having more than 25 settlers, by fulfilling quests for neutral NPCs on the map, capturing specific sectors on the map and several more. The clue: most of these victory points can be reclaimed by an enemy player if he manages to best the other player currently holding the victory point e.g. by having a settler more.<br><br>Basically there are now always three ways the player can accomplish a task. For example in order to expand his territory and get access to additional resources, there's for one the usual military way, building a huge army and just conquering it. The second way is religion. By building monks, the player can convince the current owner of a sector to give up his land without any fighting. The third way is bribing the neutral NPCs with gold, again gaining control over sectors without any fighting. <br><br>The game also features several different maps. If the player zooms all the way out, he'll see the sector map, showing how each sector is connected, where all the armies are and where all the resources are. Then there's the trade-route-map, on which the players unlock additional trading opportunities and can even gain a victory point but unlocking a specific trade-route. The third map is the tech-tree which again offers upgrades for each of the three play-styles. Techs and trade-routes can only be unlocked by one player at a time, adding another layer of competition to the game. As it takes time for the players monks to reach the library on the map in order to research a tech, his enemy can send more monks to take it from him during that time.<br><br>Besides the single player campaign, the game offers skirmishes against AI-enemies and a multiplayer for up to four players. It features a ranking system in which the player's avatar levels up by winning matches and by doing so unlocks specials including new AI-enemies, new maps and additional castle-pieces. The latter are used to customize the player's headquarter or build a completely new one from scratch. Also available is a limited map-editor allowing the player to change victory conditions, the location of sectors and other options but not actually the layout of the map.

As a last resort the player's ship can also move into a whirlpool, which teleports the ship to a random location on the map. Players get points for each ship taken down and later levels introduce new opponents such as sea monsters. The player start with three lives.

In the Speedster mode, the lines have to be destroyed before they reach the top. Useless shapes can dropped in the discard bin besides the tray, but doing so in the Speedster mode makes new lines appear faster.<br><br>Some shapes are marked with stars, giving random power-ups after being placed on their correct slots. The powers add some sand to the hourglass, highlight the correct slot for the piece being held, score up to 10,000 extra bonus points and transform all the tray pieces into wildcards. Bonus points are received when adding several shapes of the same type in succession, placing a special switcher piece that keeps changing shape until it's picked up and eliminating lines.

Description=Shaun White Snowboarding gives the player, as the title suggests, a snowboard and sends him off to four ski run locations around the world (Europe, Alaska, Japan and a fictitious location called Park City) under the watchful eye of professional snowboarder Shaun White himself as well as other professionals, moderators, pilots and such. But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards.<br><br>During the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts.<br><br>The game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests, everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in.<br><br>The multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN. The other players are also just dropped into the open world with the freedom to just do what they want on the server.

Seeking to escape the overcrowded chaos of Earth, the United Nations builds a single seedship, the UNS Unity, and sends her on a mission towards the Alpha Centauri star system. After a long journey in cryogenic suspension, the Unity reaches Alpha Centauri where the Captain is killed under mysterious circumstances. Suspecting the motives of one another, the officers and the crew split into 7 factions, each lead with a distinct ideology and motives that they seek to build the planet in their image...<br><br>Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri is best compared to Civilization II, but features many distinct differences in gameplay and thinking. In Civilization, the objective was to evolve a society from primitive tribes, whereas Alpha Centauri starts with the landing of colony pods on a barren planet with society becoming fractured. Each faction (aka nation) receives it's own share of the Unity's resources and tech base. For the basics, bases produce nutrients, materials and energy. Nutrients are required to feed to population, Materials are used in production and energy represents the commerce effect which can be traded to players diplomatically or spent on improvements. The 7 factions each have their own agenda, which is determined in large part by the Social Engineering. This enables a faction to customize its values, earning a bonus for what it considers important and a penalty for what it doesn't. Social Engineering system are discovered through research, the same as other improvements, such as structures and units.<br><br>Research is divided into 4 types of technologies, which form an intertwining tree of dependencies. They are: Conquer (direct military applications), Explore (indirect technologies for units and bases), Build (direct infrastructure application) and Discovery (Science for the sake of science, indirect applications). Because of the separation, factions can focus on what they hope the intended result of their science will be, and can be changed at any time. To explore the planet, units are needed. Any unit can be customized out of known technologies; consisting of a chassis type, reactor, weapon, armor and special abilities. Each of these components has a different expense, with untested technologies having additional overhead (prototype). <br><br>Finally, Alpha Centauri is not a desolate star system. There is life on the planet, in the form of alien fungus that litters the ground and strange creatures such as mindworms. Initially hostile to all factions, this form of life holds its own secrets and effects on the world at large.

Description=Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.<br><br>As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. <br><br>If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. <br><br>There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). <br><br>Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. <br><br>Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. <br><br>How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.

Description=Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.<br><br>As you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.<br><br>There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.<br><br>Combat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.<br><br>There are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.

Description=Sid Meier's Civilization III is a turn-based game where the objective is to rule the planet. Players control one of 15 Civilizations (Aztecs, Egyptians, Russians, etc). Each Civilization has its own particular strengths and weaknesses -- some are more scientific, for example, while others have stronger cultural or military attributes. <br><br>The point of the game is to expand the influence of your civilization through resource management, conquest, or trade with other civilizations. As game time progresses from ancient times through the modern era, your civilization will acquire new technologies, which in turn enable interesting new abilities and enhanced power.<br><br>Since there are several ways to win (military, diplomatic, or cultural), it is up to each player to determine how best to manage the division of labor -- should you spend critical resources building new cities, or should you instead push your efforts into researching new weaponry? Such decision-making and management skills are the keys to this game.

Description=Sid Meier's Civilization IV, the fourth installment of the series, starts the player, like in the previous games, with a single village in the Stone Age and has them advance from there by exploring, founding cities, researching, exploiting natural resources and eventually trading or making war with neighbouring civilizations. While Sid Meier's Civilization III put cultural influence in the forefront, this time it is religion that is put forward as a new factor underlying many aspects of the game.<br><br>In addition, Sid Meier's Civilization IV attempts to streamline gameplay by removing some features (corruption, pollution) which slowed down the late stages of the game and making significant changes to the combat system so that tactical thinking plays a more important role. Units now have a single combat value instead of defense and attack values, have a special ability and can be further enhanced with experience in a player-defined way.<br><br>The game also offers some aesthetic improvements such as a detailed 3D map, environmental ambiance and animated units.

Description=Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization is both a stand-alone addon for Sid Meier's Civilization IV and a remake of Sid Meier's Colonization from 1994. So the basic premise of the game is still that the player becomes the Viceroy of one of the four playable countries (Netherlands, Spain, France and England) in 1500 with the goal to successfully declare independence from the old world and survive the repercussions in form of the Independence War before the year 1800 (although the winning conditions can be changed).<br><br>Based on which country and which of the two available Viceroys of that country the player chooses, he gets different bonuses and starts with different units on his lone ship in front of the shores of either a random generated map or a part of real America -- but the first goal is always the same: building a settlement at a good location. Based on which resources surround a settlement, it can harvest and produce different kinds of goods by the settlers currently occupying it. If enough food (200 units) is available, an additional settler will be available to work on the fields or in the different shops or be trained to become a master in his business and thus producing even more units per turn. These goods, for example cloth made out of cotton in the weaving mill, can then be traded with the natives or the other countries settling on the continent or sent back with a ship to Europe and sold there.<br><br>In Europe the player can also buy goods or hire additional settlers with or without specialization. Often, if the religious unrest in Europe is big enough, the people will come willingly with the player. This can be accelerated by producing religion points in your colony's religious establishments. Selling goods in Europe also means paying taxes to the king who will also demand additional payments from time to time, making it harder and harder for the player to please him, which increases the need to become independent.<br><br>But independence isn't something that can be declared at any time. Instead, 50% of the settlers in the new world have to agree with the decision before it can be made. And to get those 50%, settlers need to produce freedom bells in the city hall much like all the other trade goods. It is also very important to have a consistent policy with the natives, and the other countries because your handling of those relationships is critical. <br><br>Although the overall gameplay is still the same as in the original, changes have been made beside the better graphics and the addition of a multiplayer mode. One important change is, that military units don't degrade in rank when defeated but instead just die. To compensate this, a new unit known as the Great General has been introduced to the game. Once a unit has collected enough experience points, the Great General will spawn in a nearby settlement. Combining him with another military unit will then increase its combat strength significantly. It's now also not possible anymore for several nations to chose the same founding fathers. Once a nation has accepted Benjamin Franklin's help offer, he is lost to everyone else. A nation has to fulfill certain criteria (a certain number of points in specific areas like religion or military) before a founding father will even consider joining the nation.<br><br>Other changes include the addition of national borders much like in Sid Meier's Civilization IV which allow the player to conquer other cities just by expanding their culture border far enough and the possibility to choose a government style once independence has been declared and the constitution is drafted. A monarchical system for example allows the player to still trade with Europe, although the Independence War rages.

Description=Sid Meier's Colonization is a strategy game which puts you in the role of Viceroy of the New World. You are sent by your King and country to establish colonies in the newly-discovered Americas that lie to the west. You face many of the same challenges that faced colonial organizers of the time-competition<br>from other Old World powers, strange native cultures, the problems of establishing profitable trade programs, and the problems of organizing an army from a rag-tag band of colonists.<br><br>The game begins with the European discovery of the Americas (1500) and continues until approximately the time of the American<br>Revolution (1800). In the beginning of the game you are given a trading/exploration ship and a small group of colonists. You have no knowledge of what lies ahead of your ship, so you must explore until you find a suitable spot to lay down your first colony. As your<br>colonies grow larger and larger, you inevitably encounter native populations and are confronted with competing imperial powers from the Old World.<br><br>Each of your colonies is populated by a number of colonists, who you can assign to various tasks. Some chop wood, mine for ore and collect plants outside the colony, some others stay inside to turn those raw materials into more valuable cargo - such as rum (made from sugar), coats (made of furs) or hammers (made of lumber). Hammers which aren't a cargo you can sell, but represent the speed with which you construct new buildings in your colony. Some colonists are specialists, and thus are more effective at a certain job. <br><br>The cargo you collect and produce is an important thing. You can take it to Europe to sell, and earn money to buy some other necessary things, hire colonists (though new, willing colonists appear in Europe by themselves) or buy ships and artillery. You can also trade it with the Indians or colonies of other nations. <br><br>You'll construct various buildings in your colonies. They have a lot of different functions: some of them can improve the speed with which you produce valuable cargo, others allow you to defend yourself from attacks more easily or construct ships and artillery. Some buildings require you to spend a number of valuable Tools when constructed, though you can make new Tools out of ore. <br><br>As you explore the land, you'll come across the Indian villages and some "places of interest" which can be investigated. A colonist that enters an Indian village can be welcomed with open hands, and the natives will reveal a map of nearby lands, or teach him a profession. Investigating places of interest has various consequences: sometimes you'll find nothing, sometimes you'll be killed for trespassing on ancient burial ground, but sometimes you'll find treasure! (Taking this treasure to Europe can be difficult though - if you don't have a sufficiently big ship, the King will agree to transport it for you... if you give him 50% of the gold). <br><br>To defend yourself from enemies, you'll want to have some military units. Just give a colonist a musket and he'll turn into a Soldier, give him a horse, and he's a Scout or a Dragoon. However, such a warrior is typically inexperienced, though he might gain military experience in battle. Artillery is also good at defense, but don't try to leave your colonies with it - in the open field, it is useless. <br><br>As you progress in the game, you'll feel that working for the King is getting more and more annoying, especially since he keeps raising your taxes, thus decreasing your income from sold goods. Your colonies produce "Liberty Bells", which increase rebel sentiment in the colonies. If the majority of colonists supports your yearning for freedom, you can declare independence. But when you do that, you'll have to deal with the King's expeditionary force arriving to teach you a lesson. If you manage to defeat all his incoming armies and emerge victorious from the American Revolutionary War, you've won!

Description=Made by Maxis, the company famous for its line of "Sim" games, SimPark deals with the simulation and management of a real wildlife park.  <br><br>SimPark allows you to build and manage parks from scratch, completely isolated from civilization.  You have the choice of choosing from hundreds of different species of flowers, bushes, plants, mammals, birds, and reptiles to live and thrive in your park.  Which plants and animals to put in is completely your choice, but you have to make sure that their biological needs are met so that they won't die.  You start out with a bare patch of land, but as you add plants and animals, it will begin to grow.  Depending on the climate and food available, certain animals will even begin migrating to your park.  <br><br>SimPark contains a massive database of plants and animals that you need to use in order for your park to flourish.  Over hundreds of species are cataloged in SimPark, and each article includes a brief bio, their scientific name, their wants and needs, and even an authentic recording of what each animal sounds like.  You need to utilize this information to figure out what plants and animals to put in your park, in order for the creatures to flourish.  If a creature or plant does not get enough food, a plant does not like the climate, or trees do not get the amount of water they need, your park will not grow.<br><br>When plants and animals are placed incorrectly, the park becomes unstable.  Weeds and animals will begin to overpopulate the park.  Other trees will die or get overeaten by rampaging species.  Because of this, the game tries to teach the concept of a "balanced ecosystem."  It is up to you to have an understanding of the animals in your park to preserve a balance.  Only through a perfectly balanced biological system can all of the creatures flourish.<br><br>Besides the biological aspect, there is also the managerial aspect of it.  Above all, it is up to you to manage the budget for the park.  Planting trees and adapting animals costs money, and if you can't manage that money, you're fired.  Even though you get federal funding each year, it is also important to attract visitors to the park to make a little income.  You need to make provisions for humans, like paths and bathrooms.  You also have to make sure visitors behave and do not litter or ravage the park.  Besides this, you also have the duty to identify species in your park, through a mini-game which has you identify them through their characteristics.  As well, you may  have to decide on other things like if you want to receive donations, or cater to boyscout parties (which might have negative affects on the ecosystem).<br><br>Like any classic Sim game, you can ravage your own park with disasters.  You can simulate a garbage dump disaster (a large pile of garbage and lots of rats), a fire, an alien invasion (pink and blue blobs that create garbage) and a kudzu infestation.

You can now create large houses, going up to four floors, with new types of wallpapers, carpets, stairs, fireplaces, and more.  You can connect parts of your house via a deck or patio, or a balcony-type catwalk.<br><br>When first playing the game, you can choose to move your family into a pre-made neighborhood with different themes, or you can create one from scratch.  If you have SimCity 4 and/or Rush Hour installed, you can import cities into The Sims 2 to use custom neighborhoods.<br><br>The biggest change to the game is aging and fears/aspirations.  Your Sims will now age, from a newborn to a toddler to a child to an adult and finally, to a senior.  Your Sims will also eventually die of old age (or other means, for evil players), but there is a way to prolong your Sims youth.<br><br>Fears and aspirations are just that.  Each Sim has different fears and aspirations that must be avoided and met, respectively.  If your Sim has a fear of a loved one dying, your Sim will experience difficulty for a time after the person dies.  If your Sim has aspirations to get to the top of the corporate ladder, he'll earn aspiration points, which eventually turn into a Platinum meter.  When enough points have been reached, you can buy special items, like a Money Tree which releases bags of money every so often.  Meeting your Sims fear results in his aspiration points being lowered.<br><br>Your Sims also have memories, which they will use to remember things throughout the course of their lives.  This can deeply impact gameplay depending on how you play.<br><br>The last major addition is the ability to create movies using your Sims.

Description=The Sims 3 is, as it's predecessors, a real-time simulation game where the player controls the lives of one or more people in a family including their work life and social activities. In order to do so, at the start of the game the player creates one or more characters on the character creation screen which has been even more expanded since The Sims 2. Besides more choices in terms of look, clothes, colors and such, the player also chooses five personality traits from a set of 63 sorted in four groups "Mental", "Physical", "Social" and "Lifestyle" as well as a lifetime-goal. The personality traits influence how the Sim reacts to each event in the game. The trait "work-a-holic" for example makes the Sim love to go to work and allows him to use a computer at home to put in additional hours.<br><br>The lifetime-goal on the other hand is similar to wishes but requires a lot of work to get to. While granting wishes can be as simple as ordering a pizza, one life-time-goal requires the player to make his Sim a CEO of a big corporation which can't be done over night. As a compensation, the fulfilling of a lifetime-goal grants the player a very, very large amount of lifetime-points as opposed to the normal wishes. These lifetime-points are used to buy numerous forms of relief including the ability to make the Sim immune to hunger. This allows the player to focus less on fulfilling the basic needs of a Sim but more on advancing his skills and socializing with neighbors, co-workers and other people in the city. The six needs themselves are the same as before including fun, hygiene and hunger.<br><br>As opposed to it's predecessors, the game isn't limited to the property a Sim owns with loading times in-between traveling to other places like family retreats. Instead The Sims 3 now simulates a full city the player's Sim is free to move around in and do what he wants including working and socializing but also buying groceries or books and visiting classes to further advance his personal skills. But not every house can be seen from the inside. While the gym functions like a normal house with the ability to remove the walls and look inside, other places including the work-place, book-store and hospital the Sim just enters and vanishes until his duty has been fulfilled there. The only influence the player can make in case of the work-place is how his Sim should go about his work. Should he work through lunch, get friendly with the boss or talk to his co-workers and such. All this influences both his happiness and his job performance and once his job performance reaches a certain level, he get's promoted which includes a higher pay and sometimes different work-hours. during his visits the Sim can also collect stones, gems, metals, bugs, butterflies and seeds to be used in his garden, as decoration or jewelery. If he is really bored he can even go fishing at one of the lakes and rivers.<br><br>With the money a Sim starts with and earns during the game, he either buys a pre-created lot or builds/expands his own house from ground up including all of the interior decoration. This time around stuff can even be placed in an 45 angle.

As in prior installments, players are tasked as the mayor of a newly formed municipality, taking charge of it's expansion and success. Being aimed at a younger audience than that of the other games within the series a greater emphasis is placed on managing a small, socially ideal town than a sprawling metropolis. As such it features a much more stylized, cartoon representation and user interface, a number of added features allowing for greater interactivity with the populace, and a simplified system of resource management.<br><br>As their first priority as mayor players will simply need to construct a town, supplying not only housing for their residents but employment, schools, and civic buildings as well; Roadways and bike paths being needed to connect them all. While each building has its own associated costs and benefits they're often marginal enough that a player's selection will often be as much an aesthetic consideration as a functional one. In order to finance all of this consideration will also have to be paid to the player's limited resources of water, wood, and crops, which rejuvenate only so quickly.<br><br>Interacting with the populace will also be crucial to success. Individual citizens will often offer suggestions and make demands of the mayor and so a close eye will have to be kept on their opinions of how the city is being run. Those that favor specific types of restaurants will request them and objections will be made if the city is lacking in their preferred form of recreation. Players can also take a closer look at their residents by 'removing' the tops of buildings and peering inside, watching their life unfold on a more minute scale. Specially constructed designer characters can also be made to populate the town, built to pre-defined specifications such as their preferred clothing and personal preferences.<br><br>A number of awards can be gained within the game for exemplary achievements resulting from maintaining a balanced town for some period of time. An in-game newspaper will assist in these efforts by helping to keep the player up to date on what might be wrong in their city, or how they might be succeeding.

Before actual gameplay, the player must first create a randomly created world, pick a location for a starting outpost, stock up the seven strong dwarven team for the hard seasons ahead, embark, and find a suitable location on the world map.<br><br>City building, depending on player creativity offers numerous possibilities. The basic strategy is to dig into a mountain or dig underground. Rooms may later be used for specific purposes, such as building forges, farms, sleeping quarters, all needed to strengthen the initial outpost. The first few seasons focuses on creating initial rooms, creating an economy that manufactures goods (crafts, furniture, clothing, etc.), and later selling those goods to (if available), human, elven, and dwarven caravans. All this while also trying to maintain food and alcohol stocks for your dwarven workers, managing population happiness, architectural planning, and defending the outpost from possible attacks. After the outpost is secure, the player may then have to focus on defense against kobold thieves, goblin kidnappers, brave against wild animals, and ultimately fighting off besieging forces and megabeasts.<br><br>Each dwarf has a set of skills, each indicating the level of expertise the dwarf has. A master miner for example will mine much faster than a novice miner, as so for military units. Continued use of a particular skill will increase a dwarfs' skills from the lowest dabbling skill to the highest legendary skill. Skills are also related to the many jobs available to maintain a dwarven industry, such as jewelers, smiths, masons, etc. Items manufactured may be individually used by the dwarves, incorporated into the city, or traded off to other civilizations.<br><br>Losing the fortress to the numerous challenges however, does not end the game.

Jokers can also show up during spins which allow the player to mark off any square from the column.<br><br>Players can get extra points for various feats, such as clearing the entire card. Different cards have different Slingo patterns highlighted in red that are worth extra points if the player marks every square. Sometimes, slots can produce devils that take a percentage of the player's accumulated treasure (though the treasure might be safe if the player has demon protection). <br><br>Further, there are bonus rounds to be played against a pirate where a lot of treasure is at stake.

While many elements from the original game remain present, the gameplay was adapted to a 2d top-down shooter with graphics and sounds that resemble a NES game from the eighties, especially Ikari Warriors with vertically-scrolling gameplay.<br><br>Just like the original game, players control a soldier who has access to a drug that influences the abilities. While the original game's nectar only brought along negative effects, this title's venom also has positive ones. The soldier can get more health, use an upper (speed and firing power crease, firing rate decreases), use a downer (speed and firing power decrease, firing rate increases), and activate perception to see hidden civilians, mines and venom flowers that refill the venom meter.

After being grounded by her father for stealing a constable's helmet for her personal collection, she receives a mysterious message while locked in her bedroom, challenging her to find the elusive Snark creature. She manages to break free and starts the hunt, searching for the Snark on all corners of the globe and many extra dimensions with the help of mirror portals.<br><br>Snark Busters: Welcome to the Club is a hidden object game that borrows some concepts from traditional point-and-click adventures. The gameplay follows the same pattern most of the time, where the player has to find all the scattered pieces of inventory objects and use the reassembled tools to solve puzzles. Instead of the usual list of objects to be found, the bottom of the screen displays segmented silhouettes of the items, with each piece partially filling the contour when collected. The segments are colored red when the piece is not accessible yet, usually requiring an extra step like opening a container to reveal them, turning green when they become visible.<br><br>After being completely restored, the objects can be dragged and dropped from the inventory slots to logical places on the scenery to perform an action or finish a pending task. The hint button is an emerald gem set on the bottom-right corner, that shows the position of one of the required pieces when activated, but takes some time to recharge after use. Some mini-games take place inside an interactive window at the center of the screen, where pieces and mechanisms of some sort have to be manipulated directly to solve them.

Description=The Princess Blue was a trading vessel. While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. As the only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue, you swear revenge... but it's a big and expensive universe. In order to upgrade and repair the ship, you'll need credits. Which could be obtained through trading or hunting down pirates or maybe a special mission or two. There's also the matter of finding those who are responsible for the death of the Princess Blue. Following their trail will require obtaining information from several different characters.<br><br>Space Rogue is a space simulation, a predecessor to Origin's better known Wing Commander series and specifically, Wing Commander: Privateer. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. <br><br>Interstellar travel, between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where you must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at your ship, so the faster you can get through them, the more armor your ship retains. Finally, when docked on most locations, the game shows your pilot from a top-view and you can walk to different shops/bars/characters.

The overarching narrative is disguised as a platformer where each playthrough only offers a glimpse and where the loose threads can be connected in different ways to reveal meaning.<br><br>At the start players get to choose a starting point, from the age of 6 to 8, 12, 17, 44, 73 or a random age. Each period is designed as a different platforming sequence and Joseph can move between the periods in any direction. Each location contains a number of floating bubbles that represent fragments of Joseph's life. Moving towards them reveals the title of the fragment. By walking into them Joseph narrates that part of his life while a short mini-game is played. These consists of more platforming sequences, a photo-alignment puzzle, or quick games involving switches. Failing these abruptly ends the memory. During a single playthrough only nine memories can be chosen from the many available.<br><br>To help form a coherent structure, the colour of the bubbles changes after picking the first one. Brightly coloured ones are tied directly to the previous fragment, darker ones with a bright halo only have a vague tie and the black ones are almost completely unrelated. Players get to choose which chain to form and sometimes certain memories are triggered unintentionally, as they move around following a path and Joseph can bump into them accidentally. Next to that, each age period also visually changes Joseph's appearance and his abilities. As an old man he is no longer able to jump as high and walk as fast.<br><br>Each time a chain of nine memories is formed, a conclusion is presented and the general theme is highlighted on the title screen. To grasp the complete story the game needs to be replayed multiple times and it is also influenced by the order the themes are found out. Different themes and memories represent different facets of his life and personality. Game controls consist of four keys to move Joseph around and an additional key to jump. There are fifty-two themes and more than a hundred memories to explore.

The drink stations serves drinks for the seated clients. Music from a boombox stereo system makes the customers at the tables happy, and performers entertain the patrons waiting in line.

Prior to entering the tournament, you can go to a practice center, where you can select from a large list of typing exercises (printable upon completion), or go to Glove World and play the typing mini-games.<br><br>These include:<br><br>1. Senseless Patrick - Patrick has lost his senses; you are inside his head and must type letters in a maze game to retrieve them.<br><br>2. Snail's Pace Race - Type the words at the bottom of the screen to keep your snail moving along on the racetrack; speed and accuracy count!<br><br>3. Doh Ray Me - Pick a song and type the notes (letter keys) shown to play the music.<br><br>4. A Star is Born - Type the words shown on screen to dress Patrick up in your favorite colors; mix and match to make some truly ridiculous costumes.<br><br>5. Glove World 500 - As you drive, type the words shown on your dashboard; errors manifest as splats on your windshield. Keep your eyes off the road!<br><br>The tournament itself is actually the lesson series, each one consisting of a tutorial, a drill, keystroke practice, an activity from the Glove World games, and a quiz. As you successfully complete each lesson you are considered to have won a tournament round, and the cut-scenes in between rounds are little vignettes about the character you will be facing off against next. SpongeBob also stresses the importance of ergonomics and proper finger placement - as you play you will see a keyboard on screen with a pair of semi-transparent hands showing the correct placement (I asked someone else to type while I watched, and those hands actually type each letter along with you!).<br><br>There are three levels of play - Seaworthy, Sailorific, and Holy Mackerel, so you can up your level for an extra challenge or practice.

Description=In Spore the player has to accompany a new race through five stages of it's evolution.<br><br>First there is the Cellphase: From a top-down view the goal is to eat meteorite parts floating in the primordial soup to gain DNA points. But the player's creature is not alone and other, friendly or not-so-friendly organisms float about. If the player kills other alpha organisms, he unlocks a new part for the creature editor like a new mouth. These parts all give the player's creature different abilities including singing or a better attack and even affect what the creature can eat. As the player collect's DNA points, the creature grows and moves up into a higher layer of the primordial soup until he is big enough to advance to the next stage: the creature phase.<br><br>At the beginning of the Creature Phase the player needs to redo his creature in the creature editor with a new set of parts like feet or hands. Then the goal is again to collect DNA points by roaming the land and befriending or killing the other inhabitants. Again there can be additional parts for the editor found which are dropped by alpha creature that get killed either by you or other, bigger creatures. If the player chooses not to attack but rather talk to the other races, he needs to gain their trust by following their lead and doing what they do. While the lowest creatures see you as a friend already when you just sing with them, more advanced races require a high level in dancing and other abilities which are again gained by rebuilding the creature in the editor with the gained DNA points and available parts. Once the player has collected enough DNA points and developed a certain level of intelligence by doing so, he can enter the tribes phase.<br><br>From now on the player can't change the basic anatomy of the creature but instead has access to the tools and clothing editors. The game also plays more like an RTS from now on, requiring to control a group of creature instead of just one and building up a village. Interaction with the other tribes, defending the village and collecting food are the main goals in this phase. Once the player has conquered or allied himself with five other tribes, he can enter the civilization phase.<br><br>Now the player has access to the building and vehicle editors to further specialize his former tribe and become the ruling civilization on the planet. The basic gameplay and controls remain the same as in the tribes phase but by conquering or befriending other nations, the player's civilization now get's access to new technologies - including the one required to enter the fifth, last and longest phase of the game: the space phase.<br><br>With his ship, the player now needs to go out and colonize or conquer the whole galaxy, defend his own planet against other space faring nations and supply his race with enough food.<br><br>The game doesn't have a real multiplayer. Instead the planets are populated by creations that other players made in their game. The players can choose to upload their creatures and even the whole planet to the online database called Sporepedia and from there they get distributed to everyone. Once downloaded, the AI takes over the control of these creatures and advances them further.

Description=The Spore Creature Creator is, as the name suggests, a separate release of the editor with which the player can build creatures for Maxis' game Spore, prior to the full release of the game.<br><br>The player starts with a colored blob. This blob has a spine in it through which it can be modified in both in form and size. Once the basic look of the creature is complete, the player can choose from seven different categories of parts. From mouth, over legs to decorative objects including a shark fin, dozens of items can be applied to the blob to form a living creature. The player is only limited by the available DNA points and the complexity of the creature. If the creature is already too complex in having too many body parts, the player cannot add any more to it. Each body part also increases the stats like attack rating or speed of the creature, which is irrelevant for this edition but important later for the main game. Once the creature is finished, the last steps are putting paint on it by choosing from different colors and shapes, and giving the creature a name. <br><br>Once a basic creature with the minimal body parts has been created, it can also be tested in a small arena. There the player can let it perform several different moves like attacking or dancing to look if the creature looks good in any situation. It is even possible to spawn up to three children of the creature to see how they look like. In this mode the player can also make screenshots, create avatars or film the creature while it does its moves. The editor offers the possibility to send the screenshots to a friend via mail or upload the videos directly to YouTube.<br><br>Spore Creature Creator also features the Sporepedia, a catalog of every creature created by the player, the developer or, if there is an online connection, the whole world. There the player can also choose to upload his creatures to the online catalog which then can be accessed from the official Spore homepage.

Was the captain of the player's ship previously an invisible entity without a name or anything, he now gets an individual name and can increase in rank by completing adventures either started separately or within the space phase. This on the other hand grants the captain an additional skill point allowing him to get new abilities or upgrade existing ones.<br><br>As everything else in the game, the missions are created by the players with only a handful already included in the game. These range from races to fight for your life, attack- and defend to more riddle-focused ones and show a small glimpse into what can be done with the editor. The editor itself allows the player to change everything from the surface of a planet, how the AI-controlled creatures shall react to the presence of the player to the text in the new creature dialogues and what kind of objectives need to be completed. The missions then play like the creature phase with the player controlling his captain from a 3rd-person-view over the planet but feature more possibilities thanks to high-energy weapons, jet packs and such. Also available are power-ups that refill the captains health and energy or make him faster for a short period of time. <br><br>Once an adventure is finished creating, it can be traded with other players over the Sporepedia and in addition every adventure features a high score listing. It shows how fast the player managed to complete the mission and lets him compare their score with everyone in the world.

Description=Following the on-going war of the first Star Control game, the Alliance has lost. The Ur-Quan armada systematically hunts down the alliance races and imprisons them onto their homeworlds, including Earth. However unknown to the Ur-Quan, during the war, a small research vessel had been lost while sent to a distant star system looking for evidence of the ancient Precursor race. The survivors of this research team had come across the controls to a Starship factory and used it to build a Precursor supply vessel: one of the largest vessels in the galaxy. It's time for these Terrans to return to Earth...<br><br>Star Control II is a game based on exploration, space combat, diplomacy and resource gathering. Your main starship is the Precursor vessel and it can be used to travel between star systems. This uses fuel which must be processed in exchange for raw materials. In addition to providing fuel, raw materials can also be used to make purchases. You can use them to improve your starship, buy ships for your fleet, and hire crewmembers (who represent your ships' "health"). <br><br>Raw materials are found on surfaces of planets throughout the galaxy; you have to send a landing module to the planet and then guide it around the surface as it picks up the materials you found earlier with your scanner. Each planet is unique in the type of minerals and metals it is formed of. Some planets are plagued by natural dangers such as lightning storms, earthquakes or lava which can damage or destroy your landing modules. Non-sentient lifeforms can also be found and stunned to obtain biological samples. Special installations, objects and ruins can also be found on certain planets. <br><br>While in "deep space", your starship can approach any star you come across, and then you can guide your ship around its system and land on its planets and their moons. Space is treated as two-dimensional and presented in a top-down view. There is also a starmap available which shows the entire galaxy and allows you to set your ship on auto-pilot to any star. <br><br>Throughout space are different alien civilizations. These are represented on the starmap by a sphere of influence. Within the sphere, the aliens have a controlling presence and their ships will venture freely. Outside the sphere, encounters are rarer. Aliens can be dealt with diplomatically, through a series of dialog options, or in combat. <br><br>Combat utilizes the same engine as the first Star Control game, where action is controlled from a top view and influenced by the gravity of nearby planets. Each alien vessel is controlled uniquely and has unique abilities. Combat can also be played as a standalone game ("melee mode"), separate from the main storyline.

Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace. But a previously unknown species, the Zerg, had started overrunning their colonies. A second alien species, the enigmatic Protoss, came intent on stopping the Zerg. However the Protoss solution is to extinguish all life on the Zerg-infested planets, including many Terrans. At the same time, rebel factions within the Terran government are gaining popular support during the Zerg crisis. The time for war has come.<br><br>Gameplay in Starcraft has clear similarities to Blizzard's earlier Warcraft 2. Building units requires credits and a power source, and once completed you can direct them into combat with foes. You only know the layout of terrain you have visited, and only the exact whereabouts of enemy units which are range for one of your units, due to the Fog of War. <br><br>Each of the 3 races has a distinct range of units and general strengths; Zerg units are quick to build, Terran units cost the least, and Protoss units are the most powerful individually. In a change from many strategy games the base style for each race also varies significantly, resulting in a very different playing experience with each.  Missions vary from destruction to infiltration. Realistic line-of-sight calculations make the correct result more likely. A full map editor is provided, with many user-created maps available online.

Description=StarCraft: Brood War is an add-on for StarCraft (requiring the full version of StarCraft) and a direct continuation of its story.<br><br>Brood War brings several changes to the game, altering some gameplay aspects of the game, the most important change being the addition of new units.<br><br>The Terrans receive the Valkyrie, a craft with air-to-air fighting capabilities. They also obtain the Medic, which can heal all non-mechanic units and, through upgrades, can use the Restore (remove all ailments on a unit) and Optical Flare (reduce the sight range of an enemy unit to 1) powers.<br><br>The Zergs receive the Lurker, obtained after mutating an Hydralisk, which can, and actually must, burrow to attack. They also gain the Devourer, after mutation of a Mutalisk, an air-to-air unit, whose acid shots have notably the specificity of temporarily lowering the enemy defense, allowing other units to do increased damage.<br><br>The Protoss receive the Corsair, an air-to-air unit, which has access to the Disruption Web power (which, once cast, prevents targeted enemy units from firing outside of the web). The Dark Templars, already seen in the original StarCraft are now a producable unit. Their main strength lies in their permanent cloaking, allowing them to deliver their strong close combat attacks unharmed. Additionally, in the same manner as two Templars can be merged as an Archon in StarCraft, two Dark Templars can now be merged to obtain a Dark Archon. A Dark Archon has access to several powerful powers: Mind Control (giving permanent control of the targeted unit), Maelstrom (temporarily rendering all non-mechanical units within the target area unable to do anything) and Feedback (removes from a target unit the amount of energy it has available for special powers and inflicts it this amount as physical damage).<br><br>Besides the new units, some units already featured in StarCraft can now be upgraded in certain areas.<br>For instance, the Terran Goliath can have the range of its ground-to-air missiles be tremendously increased. Similarly, the Zerg Ultralisk can now receive speed and armor upgrades.<br><br>Other changes include a better AI and some alterations of the cost of certain units.<br><br>Three new campaigns are available. In order, a Protoss campaign featuring 8 missions, a Terran campaign also featuring 8 missions and a Zerg campaign comprising 10 missions (plus a bonus mission if some requirements are met in mission 9).<br><br>The add-on also comes with about 100 multiplayer maps.

Description=Victory looks different. Yes, the United Earth Directorate is no more and the Overmind has finally been destroyed. The Terran world Tarsonis now lies in ruins, as does the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. The Queen of Blades, formerly known as Sarah Kerrigan, is still out there and Arcturus Mengsk's administration turns out to be even more dangerous than the Confederacy. No wonder that four years after the events of StarCraft: Brood War, Jim Raynor is trying to drown his sorrows with booze, while helping the rebels on Mar Sara in the fight against Mengsk's Dominion.<br>The trot changes, however, when one day Tychus Findley, imprisoned for life by the Dominion, shows up proposing a deal. Soon after that, Backwater Station is overrun by the Zerg, who are now the dominant species in the Koprulu Sector, revealing an invasion of the Terran systems. So, Raynor retreats to his flagship, the battlecruiser Hyperion, and once again enters the fight for survival - and the search for his beloved Kerrigan.<br><br>StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is the first part in the StarCraft II trilogy. As such, most of the 29 missions of the single-player campaign have the player fight on the Terran side. There are, however, a few missions where the Protoss Zeratul gets to tell parts of his side of the story, with the player controlling him and his Protoss friends. Most of the missions feature different and changing objectives but are, at their core, all about real-time strategy, with the player more often than not having to build up his base from scratch, collect the two resources, produce and upgrade an army and fight the usual suspects: other Terrans, Zerg and Protoss. The gameplay is pretty straightforward RTS, using a rock-paper-scissors system in combat between the three very different races, with each unit vulnerable to several other units and vice versa.<br><br>As the campaign progresses, the player automatically gains access to new units, which he can then upgrade in the Armory of the Hyperion in exchange for money, also earned throughout the missions. Each unit and some of the buildings can be upgraded two times, unlocking new abilities for the unit. The stimpack for the Marines, for example, which allows them to do more damage for a short amount of time at the expense of some health.<br>In addition, there's the Laboratory on the Hyperion. Here, the scientists research Zerg and Protoss DNA, which the player collects during missions by fulfilling bonus objectives. These range from simply gathering samples from dead Zerg to killing a hulking Brutalisk. After each five tiers of the DNA double helix, the player can choose between two possible upgrades in each research tree, allowing him, for example, to either automate the collection of Vespine Gas or build two SCVs at once. Once both research trees have been completed, each additional DNA artifact is sold for a sum of credits.<br><br>The third deck on the Hyperion is the bridge. Here, the player chooses one from up to three missions as his next assignment, has the ability to replay both the in-game cutscenes and the rendered sequences and replay old missions, e.g. on a higher difficulty level to earn additional achievements or to discover the consequences of different choices as the branching plot unfolds.<br><br>The fourth deck is the Cantina. Here, the player can look at trophies earned for completing a story strand (e.g. all missions given by Tychus), watch the news, hire mercenaries (who will then become available in all upcoming missions in exchange for resources) or play a round of "The Lost Viking". The latter is a full-blown vertical-scrolling shooter like Raptor: Call of the Shadows, built with the included Starcraft Galaxy Editor and featuring many elements of the main game.<br><br>StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty also offers an extensive multiplayer mode which differs greatly from the single-player experience. The player can play as any of the three races but the available units differ in part from the ones available to him in the campaign. The Terran Medic, for example, has been cut - only the flying Medivac can be built. Nine challenges are available to test the abilities of the player to e.g. know which units are best against others or how to survive the infamous Zerg rush.<br>In addition, after entering the multiplayer, the player has to play several practice rounds during which the game judges his skill and throws him in one of the five leagues (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond) and activates the match-making feature. Here, or in custom games, he can fight against up to eight players on 61 maps, some of which are specially made beginner's versions of other maps to prevent early rushes. The maps are divided into several categories based on type of gameplay, like coop, simple free-for-all or team matches, and the amount of players; eight being the largest number of players a map can hold. Bots are available to fill up open slots and additional achievements are waiting to be earned in order to unlock new avatar pictures or troop banners.

Description=The year is 2186. Humanity has established colonies on the moon, Mars, and several of the larger asteroids. Earth's sky is dotted with space habitats, and the spaceways are always busy. As usual, there is the urgent need for energy to power this advanced civilization; one of the primary sources of that energy is quantum black holes.<br><br>In STARCROSS, you are a miner of black holes, scouring the asteroid belt in your one-man survey ship. Finding and harnessing a single black hole can make a person's fortune. It's a lonely business, fraught with the known and unknown hazards of space. You've equipped your ship, the M.C.S. STARCROSS, with the best gear you could afford. You've put everything into this venture, and though you've tried before, you somehow sense that this time will be different.<br><br>The ship's computer handles the functions of navigation and routine maintenance. You watch the sophisticated mass detector as it unceasingly scans the vicinity for uncharted masses. To assuage the tedium of your long trip, you browse through the compact tape library, a compendium of human knowledge and culture. But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into a deep sleep.<br><br>As you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if your search for a quantum black hole is successful. Little do you suspect that the alarm on your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream - but not to grapple with the long-sought black hole. Your quest has taken an unexpected turn, for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan alien spaceship from the outer fringes of the galaxy.

Description=A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The Empire's currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists?<br><br>Starflight is a space exploration game. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock.

The entire galaxy is unknown and it's up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them diplomatically or engage them in combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.

Description=It seemed like a normal day. Sit back at your computer, put in a new CD-ROM and relax... unfortunately the galaxy had other plans. Without warning, a loud crash introduces you to the Starship Titanic: The Ship That Cannot Possibly Go Wrong. As the galaxy's most most prestigious, most impressive, largest and therefore most expensive interstellar liner, the Starship Titanic should be the flying treasure of the universe. Unfortunately something has, quite obviously gone wrong, or at least gone unexpectedly. The ship's main computer, Titania, has been sabotaged and gone insane. As a result, all the artificial personalities that manage the ship are also affected. You'll need to deal with a DeskBot, a BellBot, a BarBot not to mention a sarcastic parrot, a proud elevator and a stupid bomb. Without time or consideration to any other options, you find yourself quickly shanghaied aboard the Titanic, given an cheap, economy-sized room and put in charge of fixing the puzzling situation aboard the ship.<br><br>Starship Titanic is a 1st-person adventure game, described by some as a fusion of Myst if it had been conceived by Douglas Adams (author of Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy and creative force behind this game). With a basic set of navigational controls, the player must explore the starship's many rooms, obtaining and manipulating objects and conversing with many different characters in an effort to get better lodgings and set things right along the way. Conversation with these characters is done trough a parser system that recognizes key words that the player must input. At times, you are able to adjust dials which control various attributes of a robot character's personality and general usefulness.

Description=Space... the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its 5-year mission: To seek out new life and new civilizations, to explore brave new worlds, to boldly go where no one has gone before. Based on the 1960s Star Trek TV Series, Captain Kirk and the USS Enterprise are representatives of the United Federation of Planets. Their role in space is that of explorers as well as a military presence. The Enterprise routinely encounters strange adventures and bizarre situations, each laid out as a separate "episode" which must be played in order. The first episode involves the USS Enterprise being called to a world to investigate strange "demons" have appeared from the mines and begun attacking the settlers.<br><br>Star Trek: 25th Anniversary is a combination of a point-and-click, side-scrolling adventure game and a first person starship simulator. This tie-in actually missed the 25th Anniversary of Star Trek's TV debut by half a year (nearly 3 years in the case of the Amiga version), but it uses the original series' characters and settings. Players directly control Captain Kirk, leader of the Starship Enterprise, and are able to give orders to other crewmembers. While the enterprise is on a peaceful mission, combat is possible. A new game begins on the bridge of the Enterprise, seen from a 3rd person view of Kirk, but a first person view out the viewscreen of the Enterprise. When on board the ship, Kirk can contact Chekov to assign a designation, raise shields or begin combat, contact Sulu to engage warp or adjust magnification, contact Spock to scan for data and search for keyword information, contact Uhura to deal with communications, and contact Scotty to change power allocation and repair damage and beam down to a planet.  During combat, the player steers the Enterprise manually and is able to turn in 720 degrees of direction as well as increase or decrease speeds. Weaponry includes phaser banks which draw from the ship's energy and proton torpedoes which are in limited supply.<br><br>The adventuring bulk of the game comes in the form of many landing party missions, in which the player beams down to the surface of a planet and explores the situation. Kirk can move about on the screen, other crew members automatically follow him. From the menu, he chooses a body part to perform an action: eyes represent looking, mouth represents speaking, one hand represents using items (and crewmembers) while another is to pick up objects. Kirk carries an inventory of items collected which can be accessed and used at any time. In most missions Kirk will carry a communicator to contact the ship and a phaser weapon which can be set to "stun" or "kill",  The point-and-click adventure has different solutions to problems, but the ideal goal of the federation is to solve things non-violently. Performance is rated accordingly as well as being based on how many extra discoveries and advances made and interaction with different beings, including aliens. The surroundings are all based on styles from the TV series and solutions to puzzles involve the skills of multiple crew members.

It seems someone has made an assassination attempt on the Empire's head honcho Supreme Chancellor Gowron. The conspiracy runs deep, and not even the members of the Council or the Honor Guard can be trusted. Except you, of course, since you just got here and have no idea what's going on. That's why Honor Guard leader Korek has assigned you to track down the assassins and give them a taste of vengeance, Klingon style. What follows is a sonic disruptor bolt filled, pink blood spilling spree through various Klingon locations such as a Klingon suburb, the penal asteroid Rura Penthe, and even the interior of a Bird of Prey spaceship. Although the way you'll be alternatively taunted and ordered around by your commander Kurn,  fight your way through an alien conspiracy, and ultimately face off with a pair of familiar faces from Generations who you'd think would be dead by now.

The game also includes references to popular culture, such as the selection of "Scrapped Scripts" which show what Star Wars would have been like if it had been written by Woody Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, Spike Jonze, or Quentin Tarantino.

Description=Dark Forces marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the First Person Shooter market. Instead of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal "Jedi" engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.<br><br>The player takes control of Kyle Katarn; an Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance.  After a prologue mission where he steals the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his "Dark Troopers" - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.<br><br>Dark Forces features 14 substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the Star Wars trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer.  Every level has objectives for Kyle to complete (rare, for First Person Shooters of the period), ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it.  Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot.<br><br>The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, and the game features Imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off, or directly replicating, John Williams' original film score.<br><br>Dark Forces is entirely a single-player campaign, and no multiplayer is included or supported.

Description=(From Infocom Home Page site)<br><br>After the fall of the Second Galactic Union in 1716 GY, a ten-thousand-year dark age settled upon the galaxy. Interstellar travel was nonexistent, and many star systems descended into a near-barbaric state, buring coal and gas for energy, and growing food directly from exposed topsoil. In 11,203 GY, a treaty between the Empires of Tremain and Galium formed the Third Galactic Union. Ships of the Stellar Patrol (a pseudo-military wing of the Union government on Tremain) began exploring the galaxy, searching for the human civilizations that are the remnants of the Second Galactic Union. You are a native of the planet Gallium, one of the most politically powerful but culturally barren worlds in the Union. Your great-great-grandfather was a founding officer of the Stellar Patrol, and for five generations, your family has served in the Patrol. It was always taken for granted that you would sign up as soon as you came of age. Once in the Patrol, you discovered that the exciting career promised in all the Patrol recruitment brochures was nonsense. Your life was drudgery and demerits. The one time you got to see an exotic planet was right after a big parade, when they needed a detail to sweep up all the confetti. Then came your big moment: shipwrecked on a seemingly deserted world, you met an exuberant robotic companion named Floyd. Together, the two of you discovered the secret of that mysterious planet, Resida, and saved it from near destruction. As a result of your heroics, you were offered, and quickly accepted, a juicy promotion. Good-bye Ensign Seventh Class -- hello Lieutenant First Class! No more scrubwork! No more bathroom details! No more cleaning groth cages! Finally, your life in the Stellar Patrol would be as exciting as those brochures had promised! Oh, how naive you'd been. Your daily routine simply replaced tedious scrubwork with tedious paperwork. Since your planetfall on Resida, five long years have dragged by, without a single event worthy of note. Why, just look at today's "thrilling" assignment: scooting over to Space Station Gamma Delta Gamma 777-G 59/59 Sector Alpha-Mu-79 to pick up a supply of Request for Stellar Patrol Issue Regulation Black Form Binders Request Form Forms...

Description=Like its predecessor, Sunset Studio: Love on the High Seas is a hidden object game with a Hollywood parody theme. As the assistant of a starlet called Katherine Connick, the player has to help her and the film production staff of a disaster movie called "Titanship". Most of the time, the objective is to find and click on all the items listed as tabs at the bottom of the screen, on scenes that are mostly static representing sets and other locations of a movie studio. A minimum of twelve objects have to be found within a time limit to successfully complete a scenario and unlock the next chapter. The locations can be revisited after failure, to make a new attempt or achieve a higher score.<br><br>The hint system has extensive help options, accessible as a series of buttons on the cell phone at the bottom-left. The magnifying glass button replaces the names on the objects' tabs with pictures for a few minutes. The viewfinder button puts a rectangular lens on the screen, that can be moved around the scenery with the mouse, its picture getting sharper when over one of the required items. The text message button displays a brief written description of the location of a list object. The spotlight button shines two light beams over one of the list items, moving from one item to another for a few seconds. Each button has a counter underneath showing the number of available uses left. Extra hints can be acquired by completing the random rush job challenge, that starts after receiving a phone call from one of the characters, where the goal is to find a specific object before the allotted time ends. The timer for the challenge is shown as a diminishing star background on the object tab.<br><br>Besides the hint buttons, there are two helpful items that can be found and clicked on the locations. Buckets and boxes of popcorn cover the visible tabs at the bottom, making the objects shake when the cursor hovers near them. Photographic equipment makes the screen white and bright with their flashing cameras, highlighting several objects at once.<br><br>After completing a portion of the main mode, the cutting room becomes available, where the objective is to find one object per scene as fast as possible, with every item found adding a few seconds to the timer. There are 15 unique hidden object environments and 60 rounds to play. Optionally, the player can compare scores with other players through a global high score list.

Description=The game concept is that you have to eliminate clusters of at least 3 blocks with your mouse, but the more you remove at once, the more you score. Once that happens, all blocks above the ones, which have vanished, will fall down and close the gap.<br><br>Beneath the lowest row, there you see the new row building up. Once all blocks are present, this row will be now the lowest row, while all others are moving up. Once one block reaches the top of the playfield, you loose.<br><br>Each individual level has a preset value of rows, which will build up. To win a level, all you have to do, is to prevent that a full vertical row (from bottom to top) gets stacked up.<br><br>The game offers 4 game modes: Traditional, Puzzle, Relapse, and Strategy. Two of them need a brain, while the other two just need a fast hand.<br><br>Traditional works like explained above. New rows show automatically, with increasing speed not only from level to level, but also in a level. Means: the level starts slow, but in the end, new rows will complete every second. Power-Ups are available in this game mode.<br><br>Relapse works exactly like Traditional, but with one major difference. The action isn't just limited to the bottom of the playfield, in fact, both bottom and top now filling with blocks. Power-Ups used on one side affecting both. How to win is the same, but you loose, when blocks from one side touching the other.<br><br>Strategy is one of the two game modes where you must think. Clicking fast will only help to see the Game Over screen. New rows won't appear automatically, instead for each cluster you remove, a full new line will appear. So you have to plan carefully before neutralizing a cluster.<br><br>Puzzle is the game mode, where no new lines appear. Also there are no Power-Ups here. But this is the most complex game mode. Your task is to completely remove all blocks, if at least one block is still available, you loose. There is also no time limit, so you can think as long as you want.<br><br>The first three game modes offering bonus levels, which works like the Puzzle mode. So, if one block remains, you only scoring the normal points for removed clusters. Only when all blocks are removed, you score the bonus points. There are only two differences: it isn't so complex, and you only have 15 seconds time.<br><br>There are 5 different Power-Ups in the game (2 good, 2 bad, 1 depending of the situation): Platform Block (won't move, just blocking the vertical row where it is), Indestructible Block (does move like a regular block, but can't removed with normal actions), Color Bomb (one of each of the 5 colors, will detonate all same colored blocks in it's big radius), Super Bomb (shorter range than the Color Bomb, but blow up all blocks, regardless the color; only way to remove Platform/Indestructible Blocks), and finally, the Gravity Block (only available in Relapse Mode, will shift all blocks from the side where it was activated to the other side).

There are 47 levels to this game and the levels are split within 10 stages. As Supercow, you must dash through levels and collect various treasures and stomp on enemies to kill them. Naturally there will be enemies who will need a different tactic to defeat them such as the porcupines who will require you to have hyper-hoofs to be able to safely stomp on them. There are a few other power-ups within the levels such as a super jump and an invulnerability sphere. Naturally there are also health and life power-ups. <br><br>Besides the typical patrolling enemy the player will also need to be on the lookout for flying enemies such as birds, suspended enemies <br>such as spiders and of course traps and mechanisms of the levels themselves. Mechanisms such as giant blades will drop from a ceiling to cut the player and there are also a few pitfalls and flame-pits.

Also there are automated ramps and terrains of different properties such as icy levels. Some parts of the levels contain garbage bins and trash heaps which you can stomp to transform into flowers. <br><br>Not all levels require you to just find the exit, some require you find all the hidden keys or destroy all enemies.

Once you removed the critical amount of blocks (i.e. 56 of out 64 at level 1), you have the opportunity to reach level two (and then so on) once all possible combinations are made. But when you made all possible combinations before you reach the critical amount needed, the game will end.<br><br>There are two situations, where you run into a dead end. When there are five blocks of a kind left in the playfield, but you just combine three blocks, those two can't be removed anymore.

Description=The basic idea behind the game is to remove all Sveerz from the playfield before they reach the most upper row. For this you must use your brain, or say better, your memory.<br><br>The Sveerz are extra-terrestrials who cruise the galaxy with their spaceship (the playfield).<br><br>The game offers four different game modes: Arcade, Memory, Puzzle, and Rhythm<br><br>While Puzzle is actually the one game mode, where you dont need good memory to survive, so is it a game mode, which you can also find in the other three game modes, as the basics. So, I begin with it:<br><br>Once you started a game, you will be confronted with your playfield, which is hexagon-style. <br>At the beginning, a certain amount of Sveerz is already in the playfield, currently floating, while a much higher number of them are in reserve (up to 99). Furthermore, there is a crossing station. Once you clicked someone, they all fall down, filling the hexagon playfield. Now the game really begins.<br><br>Once you clicked someone, he disappears and the ones from the crossing station will fall down into the playfield. If the playfield is empty, for whatever reason, this click will move Sveerz from the reserve to the crossing station, and the next click will drop them down. While you can only click one Sveerz at a time, normally up to 4 of them falling down. So, you now have to use strategic skills, or better say, you must create Combos. A Combo happens, when at least 3 Sveerz of the same colour (possible are red, blue, green, and yellow) forming a row, either horizontal, or diagonal (vertical is not possible, because of the hexagon). Once this happens, they disappear and you get extra scores. The more Combos you make simultaneously, the better you score. There is no difference between real or following simultaneously (immediately disappearing or disappearing follows disappearing without a turn). The Oversveerz (needed for the other three modes, explanation there) will tell you, how good you are (Double, Triple, Quad, or Krazy Combo). When you removed them all, you proceed to the next level. If they reached the top row and new drop in, you lost.<br><br>If you good enough to clear the playfield while there are still Sveerz to clear (from reserve/crossing), the level prematurely ends successful with a Perfect Clear, and showing you a Perfect Clear Level Completed-scene, one of a dozen unique.<br><br>To make this more challenging, there a three types of special Sveerz in this game mode. Multiplier Sveerz (offer 2x, 3x, and 5x multiplier), Wall Sveerz (will redirect dropping Sveerz, or block them, if there are more than just one Wall Sveerz), and Bomb Sveerz (will destroy any Sveerz direct adjacent to them, including Wall Sveerz).<br><br>The Arcade game mode now needs your memory. This time, not only the little Sveerz are important, but also the 4 big Oversveerz at the outer edge of the playfield. Once you start the game, these Oversveerz will sing you a special colour sequence. Like green, red, green, now you must click the little Sveerz in exact the same sequence. If you do this, they vanish, if you made it wrong, nothing happens. Either way, from time to time, new Sveerz dropping in. Furthermore, there is a (short) time limit. If you need too much time, the sequence will eventually fail. All the bonuses and special Sveerz, like Combos and Bombs, are also in this mode (available). So you can make some Combos, if you made sequences wrong, to prevent loosing. Bombs working special here, they not only destroy the adjacent Sveerz, but they also interrupt the current sequence, resulting in a success, even with no Sveerz removed. So, if you cant remember the sequence, cancel it with a bomb. Furthermore, this game mode introduces a new special bonus, the Chain Reaction. If you click adjacent Sveerz while clicking the sequence, you are getting special bonus points. But they must be clicked adjacent, means first left, then middle, then right is a Chain Reaction. But first middle, then left, then right is no Chain Reaction, even when they all adjacent.<br><br>While Arcade is fast paced with short sequences, Memory needs now really your memory. In this game mode you have much more time to answer the sequence, but you need this time, since the sequences becoming really long (up to a dozen colours, maybe more). In this game mode, there is a unique Sveerz available, who help you when you forgot a certain colour  the Rainbow Sveerz. This works like a joker, once you click him, he will change into the correct colour currently needed. If you make the sequence, he will vanish with all the other Sveerz involved. If you fail, he will stay with the colour he was meant to be.<br><br>The final game mode is called Rhythm. This is the most complex mode. It works like Arcade, but has three major differences. First, there is a time limit, but if you fail to complete the sequence in time, nothing happens, except the sequence gets reset and a new one starts. Second, in addition to the correct sequence, you also have to provide the rhythm, which were used by the Oversveerz. So you must reproduce the sequence with the exact pause length between each colours sung. Third, the Sveerz dropping, it is now directly related to your success with the rhythm. If you make a 100% exact reproduction of the sequence, no Sveerz will drop. For decreasing accuracy, the number of dropping Sveerz will increase (1 Sveerz for 75%-99%; 2 for 50%-74%; 3 for 25%-49%, and 4 for 0%-24%). Good luck.<br><br>In addition to the game modes, the game offers the following special features: Multiple local highscores, one for each game mode; a worldwide Internet based highscore; and Text-to-Speech-function, which will practically speak anything in the game, including your score, and even your name. Both Oversveerz and Text-to-Speech Voices can be customized.

Description=2072; orbiting Saturn aboard TriOptimum Corporation's Citadel space station. You awaken from a six-month healing coma with a broken memory and a newly-installed cybernetic interface to discover that most of the other occupants of the station are dead... or worse. The station's self-sufficient AI, SHODAN (Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network) has assumed total control and seems hell-bent on destroying all human life. TriOptimum believes you are Citadel's last hope. Can you save yourself and smash SHODAN's evil plans? <br><br>System Shock incorporates first-person shooter and adventure gameplay styles, with role-playing elements thrown in. To complete the game, you'll have to explore the ten levels of Citadel, solving puzzles, fighting enemies and fulfilling objectives. <br><br>On your way, you'll encounter numerous enemies - robots, cyborgs and mutants, all of which can be fought back with a variety of weapons. Some of the weapons use ammo, while other have infinite ammo and instead draw on your electric energy. Some weapons are more effective on certain foes - e.g. the dart gun only works on organic enemies, while the magpulse is best used against robots. Once killed, the enemies can be searched for ammo and other items. You can also find items in crates, cabinets, corpses or just lying around on the ground. <br><br>Apart from weapons and ammo, you'll find patches (such as medical patches, which replenish your health; berserk patches, which temporarily increase your strength but cause hallucinations; detox patches, which remove the harmful effects of radiation and biohazard; etc.), grenades of various kinds (EMP grenades work great on robots, gas grenades are good for mutants, land mines can be used to set traps, etc.), battery packs for replenishing electricity, first aid kits for restoring health, and others. <br><br>Thanks to your implant, you can install various pieces of hardware into your body, such as a booster which makes you go faster, or a head lantern to bright up dark areas. As you progress in the game, you'll find higher versions of existing hardware, which are more effective and useful. However, most hardware uses up your electric energy while it's active. <br><br>At some places in the game, you have to find a wall-mounted "cyberjack" to go into cyberspace in order to find data that will help you, remotely open doors or unlock sealed areas, or give yourself clearance to access off-limits areas. Cyberspace is represented as a 3-D wireframe place, where you fly around freely in three dimensions, shoot hostile cyber-guards with phasers, and collect files represented as colorful cubes. <br><br>The story of the game is mostly told through e-mail messages you receive, and electronic diaries (logs) left by various characters (as well as SHODAN herself), which are scattered around the space station.

It works very well, but it doesn't just eat dirt and the more it eats, the larger it gets.<br><br>You control this gray goo and take it from microscopic size to cosmic size.  You'll start out eating small and large pieces of dirt like you're supposed to.  But you keep growing and work your way up the food chain.  Dirt isn't filling anymore, so you start eating small toys and mice, then cats and dogs.  Eventually, you start eating people, cars, and houses.  But you keep growing.  Nothing can stop you... not even the cosmos!<br><br>Control is done completely with the mouse.  Depending on the level, you may need to be careful what you try to eat.  You can only eat things smaller than you, and some things that are larger will either hurt you or kill you if you touch them.  Some will even shoot at you, such as police officers and tanks.  The goal in most levels is to eat enough to grow to the next size.  There are also a few levels that are "bonus" levels, such as trying to get 4 puzzle pieces by moving through a small maze.<br><br>There are 3 modes to play the game in: Normal, Casual (easier and no time limit), and Endurance (more time needed per level and more difficult).

Later levels include special tiles that speed up or slow down the ship, bounce it around, reverse it, or turn gravity upside down. Special strategies are also introduced, such as grinding off ledges, consecutive jumps and small changes in direction. After completing a number of tracks, bonus options become available, allowing the player to change the ship's colour, shoot obstacles, and more. All tracks are available right away and the game keeps track of the fastest times. It also includes an editor to create, share and import custom levels.

Description=Team Fortress 2 is the successor of Team Fortress Classic and is also a class-based multiplayer team shooter.<br><br>The game features nine classes which cover all the classics from the original game including the Heavy Weapons Guy, the Pyro and the Spy. Each class has a different set of weapons and abilities. While the Heavy Weapons Guy has his mini-gun and moves slowly over the map, the medic stays in the background and uses his healing beam to assist the Heavy. If he does so long enough the medic can then trigger an bercharge which makes both targets invulnerable for a few seconds. The spy is instead more of a loner and disguises himself as the enemy in order to infiltrate them and make instant melee-kills.<br><br>To use all these classes the release version of the game features six maps with different gameplay modes. On the remake of the TFC-map "2Fort" you play old-school CTF. On "Granary" and "Well" the teams need to capture all five control points in a chain (much like in Dark Messiah of Might & Magic) in order to win. "Dustbowl" and "Gravel Pit" feature assault-type gameplay were one team is placed in the offensive and the other in defense. Last but not least on the map "Hydro" the teams fight over two points at one time in an attempt to reach each other's main base. In April 2008, a new game mode called Payload was introduced with the map Gold Rush. In payload the blue team has to push a rail kart carrying a bomb through a series of checkpoints before eventually detonating it in the red teams base. The red team has to defend the checkpoints and prevent the cart from reaching the end of its route within a limited time. <br><br>The game logs every player activity and makes intensive use of statistics. Even when you die the game tells you for example how long you've survived and if you've done better in the past. At the end of each round you get a personal overview with statistics for every class and like in Battlefield 2 you can access all the stats from the main menu. Also included are a developer commentary and a bunch of achievements.<br><br>Graphically Team Fortress 2 features a unique graphical style called "signature" which gives it a very comical and humorous look but without the black cell-shading elements that you know from games like XIII. The Windows game can be bought stand-alone, while the Xbox 360 version is only available in The Orange Box.

Description=Space is a dangerous place. For that reason, the Alliance of Space-Faring Alien Races (ASFAR) was formed to prevent interstellar war from breaking out. The ASFAR provides robotic Perimeter Defense Computers (PDCs) to watch over the star systems of each member race and prevent any single race from mobilizing weaponry. For 70 years, this has been successful, until suddenly, in the year 2704 A.D., PDCs direct armadas from all other systems to attack Earth. While bloody, the planet ultimately survives and rebuilds its military forces. The TV-202 is constructed, an advanced fighter craft that is equally agile in space and atmosphere. The TV-202 will be sent to various ASFAR planets in order to destroy their military compounds and prevent them from rebuilding attack fleets.<br><br>Terminal Velocity is a first-person flight simulator sometimes compared to Descent due to its free-roaming nature. Players take control of the TV-202, a fighter notable for its ability to fly in 720 degrees of direction, ignoring gravity and providing constant thrust. While flying to different planets, the TV-202 is able to speed up and slow down, but will never come to a complete halt. The majority of the game takes place in the air (and sometimes space), flying above landscapes which include trees, mountains, rivers, snow and other terrain. Additionally, tunnels can be found, often hidden, dug into the sides of landscape. Upon entering these tunnels, the TV-202 loses its ability to turn around (going ahead constantly) and must navigate avoiding enemies, moving walls, rotating obstacles and other hazards. Power-ups are found by destroying enemy forces or destroying enemy bunkers which are scattered around each level.<br><br>The TV-202 has an energy shield which is depleted by enemy fire and running into terrain, when the shield is gone, the player is destroyed. Shield Power-ups and Energy Core power-ups can be found to restore shield energy. For weaponry, the player begins with a single Plasma Assault Cannon (PAC) weapon that fires straight ahead. Other weapon power-ups can be found which include a PAC power-up, an Ion-burst gun (ION), Rapid Targeting Laser (RTL), Manual Aimed Missile (MAM), Seek and Destroy Missile (SAD), Shock wave Torpedoes (SWT) and Discrete Annihilation Missiles (DAM). With the exception of the Annihilation Missiles, all these weapons also fire directly in front of the player. There is an afterburner fuel power-up which will allow the TV-202 to increase its thrust substantially, traveling much faster than normal.<br><br>Each world features its own unique enemies and hazards. The different levels of the game provide unique objectives which can include flying to checkpoints, destroying specific targets (including bosses) and entering tunnels. Upon completing the necessary objectives, the player is directed to exit the level via a Departure Unit (DUN) located somewhere on the map.

The goal of each level is to reach the exit, but this cannot be done by travelling towards it directly. Theseus is only able to move one tile at at time, while the minotaur can do two. To reach the exit, Theseus has to outsmart the minotaur by luring him into a specific position, exploiting the internal movement logic. The minotaur will not chase after Theseus directly, but approaches him based on rules of vertical and horizontal movement. For instance, when Theseus is on the same horizontal line as the minotaur, but with a wall between them, he is able to move left and right as much as he wants without having the minotaur move. At certain moments it is also needed to delay an action or skip the turn, to lure the minotaur into a certain path without moving Theseus.<br><br>The character can be moved around using the keyboard keys or mouse. It is possible to undo moves, restart the level or shows the entire solution step by step. An additional button or key is used to perform the "wait" action. Next to the main game, a level editor is also included, where custom puzzles can be designed and saved.

Rebus Isle: Solve rebus puzzles on this island, which are puzzles that involve forming words by adding and subtracting sounds based on various pictorial and animated clues given by the puzzle. For example, 'st' plus a picture of an earring leads to the word "steering". The game has a built-in spell checker/dictionary to help the player along with a hint system.<br><br>Airshow Isle: Plan and coordinate an air show.<br><br>Stadium Isle: Help Fripples (denizens of this particular island) find their seats in the stadium. There are particular rules that each Fripple must follow. For example, cheerleader Fripples only cheer if they sit in pairs.<br><br>After working through enough puzzles and collecting enough clues, the player is able to use the clues to narrow down the suspects in the database.

The game closely follows the plot of the original Three Musketeers novel.<br><br>This 17th century role playing game focuses on d'Artagnan's adventures with the famous three musketeers: Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Cardinal Richelieu, the most powerful man in France, launches a plot to disgrace the queen and it's up to d'Artagnan and his three friends to save her honor. Later in the game, the beautiful but deadly Milady de Winter becomes the chief concern of the four comrades.<br><br>Dueling enemies, gathering loot, and firing muskets are central to the gameplay. Gaining experience points and new equipment are important, but probably less so than in typical RPGs. A "breadcrumb" system is used to guide the player to the next objective, preventing them from getting lost. In addition to the main story, there are optional side-quests and mini-games to play.

Description=Tidalis is a puzzle game where the player has to use streams to match blocks of the same colour. This is called a chain reaction.  Each block has an arrow on it which decides what direction the flow will go. By clicking on a block the player starts a stream which flows through all blocks in its range (three spaces) of the same colour. After creating a chain reaction the blocks will be removed from the screen. Blocks come in different colours and a stream can travel through blocks of other colours than the starting one without any effect. Blocks can't be moved but they can be rotated so that their arrow direction changes. When blocks are removed from the screens other blocks will fall down and take their place. Falling blocks will send out new streams when they land and therefore it's possible to create combos (several chain reactions in a row). More blocks fall from the top of the screen and the player has to clear them out so that they don't reach the top. If they do the player will lose. The criteria for success differs from level to level. Most common is to clear a number of blocks or to survive for a set time.<br><br>Tidalis comes with several game modes of different kinds with both action and puzzle based gameplay. The adventure mode features a story where the player travels through the land of Tidalis and 115 levels. The player can choose to skip a level and it will then return later. The adventure mode is action based and plays as described above. Action based levels can also be played in the quick game mode where the player can customize the game in a number of ways such as difficulty, rules and game styles. For a more puzzle based gameplay the player can try to solve brainteasers which lack the time limits of the action based levels. The player can also create his own custom games where he choose from a large amount of settings and include only the game styles that he finds interesting. <br><br>The game also features a number of multiplayer game modes. Offline it can be played by two players either on one or two game boards. Playing on one board is the same as the single player mode but with one player controlling the mouse and the other the keyboard. There is some limitations with this however since the players can't compete against each other. To do so two boards are needed. Over network the game played by up to four players on two computers. Both co-op and versus modes are available. In multiplayer it's possible to apply handicaps to the players. This allows players of different skill to compete or contribute on the same level.

Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.<br><br>The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.<br><br>The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).<br><br>On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off.

Description=TOCA Race Driver 3 follows on from the ideas started in Race Driver 2. The game attempts to include as many different forms of four-wheeled racing in one game, as well as injecting each with a high degree of realism.<br><br>The game has over 70 licensed cars and 80 real tracks, as well as 35 different disciplines of racing.<br><br>There are two main gameplay modes. The World Tour mode has the player starting a racing career and, with the help of a Scottish manager, attempting to gain renown and acceptance into more famous racing events. There are 3D rendered cutscenes shown from the player's point-of-view, which move the story along and, while not as detailed as its predecessor, gives a good idea of the back scenes of a professional racer's life aside from just the racing. This mode includes mixtures from all the racing disciplines.<br><br>The second mode allows the player to choose one discipline and play a career focused on that choice. This mode has no back-story and longer, more realistic races.<br><br>TOCA Race Driver 3 provides two different driving models, Simulation and Pro-Simulation. The latter is recommended for gamers with analog steering wheels only. Simulation is intended for gamers without wheels, or who want an easier experience. This mode is also noticeably easier than the Simulation mode from TOCA Race Driver 2.

Description=The classical first installment of Tomb Raider with four additional levels, specially designed for Gold Edition.<br><br>You're in the role of Lara Croft, a great looking female who, tired of her boring English life, has decided that dangerous adventuring is more her cup of tea. Eventually, her wishes come true as she meets a wealthy tycoon who hires her to retrieve a single artifact from a ruined temple in South America. After you get the artifact, you find out that it's only one out of three mysterious parts that are hidden in a 'tomb' world all around the globe. You'll travel through many worlds and distinguish places like Egyptian sphinxes, Greek temples, Atlantis and more... and with each, tougher traps and riddles to confront. Since tombs are usually radiated with 'no-living-person' atmosphere, you won't find much of a human enemy on your quest, in fact quite a small amount. Most of all, you'll battle wolves, bears, bats, and that sort of animals. Just to add a woman touch to all of that, you'll be using a pair of magnums, a shotgun and an Uzi to express your feelings. Each level brings a new world to explore and new threats to our heroine, so watch your steps and be cautious.

All of your party members also share an additional pack which can be used to transfer items between them.<br><br>The animal companion you choose at the beginning of the game is more useful than in other RPGs. This pet can wear 2 rings and an amulet, can carry as many items as you can in its own pack, and levels up with experience. Its items can be sold to shopkeepers or shared between the party. You can teach your pet tricks, like fetching dropped items or to cast 2 spells of your choosing. To turn your pet into a vicious fighting monster, feed it fish before a battle. Different fishes found or caught by you in the game have varied effects on your pet.<br><br>Exploring, fighting and casting are controlled by using both the left and right mouse buttons. Keyboard keys are used for assigning items to quick slots and for accessing the various screens (character sheet, inventory, spells, map etc.) Difficulty settings range from Easy through Very Hard. Graphic options include the ability to switch between Full Screen or a smaller Windowed display, various resolution settings (the highest being 1920 x 1200), shadows, anti-aliasing, and more. The "Render Behind Walls" option allows you to see a silhouette of your character behind obstacles. You can also opt to disable the gore.<br><br>Most levels are randomly-generated but are diversified so as not to become repetitive. Inside you'll find secret rooms, traps, swinging bridges, levers, shrines, non-monster encounters, and elevation changes. The game features a handy Automap to help you find your way around and tool-tips for getting acquainted with the gameplay.

Description=tranquility is a game where the player flies and bounces around a colorful and geometric world. Within this world there are usually many platforms floating in the air and a "spinner" in some hard-to-reach place. Reaching the spinner is the goal of each level. The platforms have various shapes, and some might be moving. The player moves around in the game world by moving the mouse; gentle, subtle movements are required for effective control. By bouncing off the floor and platforms, the player can reach very high altitudes where the gravity will drag them down slowly. To bounce higher, the player can press the Space bar to increase his downward speed, then release it just before hitting a surface. Going through a bottom of a platform will also launch the player upwards. <br><br>The levels and the music of the game are procedurally generated online by the game servers and sent to the player's computer. The levels come in batches of seven; each time the player collects a spinner, the player is immediately transferred to the next level; after the player collects the seventh spinner, points are awarded before a new collection of levels starts. As the player completes levels and receives score, the player moves up "Ranks" and "Realms", receiving virtual cards that represent his progress through the game. The player's score and cards are saved on the server and can be viewed at any time. <br><br>Free and paid memberships used to be available. The free membership adds a couple of features, but it is only the full, paid membership that makes the entire game experience available - without a membership, the player can only play a free set of random seven levels every day and his score isn't being registered. <br><br>The game servers and thus the game itself are scheduled to close in 2010.

You can either help the natives drive the Vikings away or conquer these islands in your name as the Vikings.<br><br>Tribal Trouble is faster paced than your normal RTS with its added simplicity. Each game takes place on a randomly generated map and resource gathering is as simple as assigning the number of men you want to automatically go out and collect that resource for you. There are only three types of buildings on offer with more of the game focused on the actual combat.

Description=TriJinx is a tile matching puzzle game using an Egyptian theme.<br><br>Each level consists of a playfield, which is partly filled by different colored triangles. Therefore the playfield is either a triangle or a hexagon itself. What you now have to do is to remove a group of at least three different colored triangles from the playfield by clicking on one of them. Each triangle you remove gets put into the urns on the top. And once all of them are full, you have completed the level. But you play each level against the clock. Once your time has run out or you remove the triangles too slow (as new once dropping in from the top and once the top is reached...), it's Game Over.<br><br>If you don't seem to find any matches, or if the playfield gets dangerously high on just one side, you have the possibility to rotate the entire playfield to the left or right as often as you want. This results in that all the movable triangles fall into new positions, allowing new possible matches.<br><br>The game is divided into three game modes: Adventure, Arcade and Puzzle.<br><br>Adventure is the story mode: It's the year 1935 and you are playing Kristine Kross, who is searching for his missing father, who was last seen near a newly discovered pyramid, the Tomb of Triclops near Luxor, Egypt. After arrival, you are confronted with a sealed door, which you must open by playing the puzzle game. And while playing the 86 levels, the story continues to unfold in drawn comic-style cutscenes.<br><br>Arcade is Adventure without the story mode, but both two have the following unique additions to the gameplay mentioned above: <br><br>You can have color coded urns instead of normal ones (so i.e. only red triangles can be collected etc.), there are persistent or destroyable blocks, you can use bombs to destroy colored triangles and destroyable blocks. There are also chameleons (changing color), multi-colored triangles (act as any color) and colored scarabs (destroying all triangles of the same kind) on the playfield. And much more...<br><br>In Puzzle (or Bonus levels from the above game modes), you really have to think, as you must match given geometric figures with the ones you find on the playfield. Which, of course, get more and more difficult the more you complete.

Description=When the king dies, there is no one to take the throne and the unspecified kingdom is left without a ruler. Soon, chaos ensues as the dead rise from their grave and take over the nation, driving everyone away. In this abandoned country, the lives of three characters become entwined. The thief Zoya make use of the situation to infiltrate the Astral Academy to steal riches. She discovers an artifact that glues her to the object, unable to move. Her fate is shared by Amadeus the wizard. Through an unfortunate experiment he was in a deep sleep and when he awakes he finds out everyone has left. As a light comes from a shrine in the academy, he discovers the thief and makes the same mistake. Finally there is Pontius the noble knight. More muscle than brains, he has bravely stayed behind to defend the academy, but he too, when discovering the duo, touches the object. The wizard recalls that the artifact is called The Thrine, with the magical power to connect souls. Against their will, the three characters are now bound in their fate, their lives connected, and need to find a way to undo the powers. They explore the kingdom, looking for traces of the Guardian who is said to control the powers of The Trine.<br><br>Trine is a physics-based action game where the strengths of each of the three characters need to be used cooperatively to complete puzzles and advance. When playing alone, the player can switch between any of the three characters at any time, but the game can also be played offline with three players simultaneously, each controlling one of the characters on the same screen, similar to the Lost Viking series. The game uses 2D-sidescrolling gameplay, but with many different layers in the front and the back that provide depth, and a camera that zooms dynamically. Each of the three characters has specific abilities. The thief is able to grapple wooden surfaces and uses bow and arrow to attack enemies, or fire arrows to light torches. The wizard uses his magic to move objects, and he is also able to create planks and crates. The knight is the blunt force, relying on his sword and shield to take care of enemy threats, and he is also able to lift and move heavy objects. The three characters constantly need to work together to get past obstacles and often there are multiple solutions. The environment is physics-based, with objects that can be stacked and swung, and breakable surfaces.<br><br>There are also minor RPG elements to the game, as green potions provide experience. The characters can be leveled up for each of their three possible skills. Levels are also filled with hidden locations that often contain chests with items that enhance the characters' abilities. That way, they can resurrect, breathe underwater or get better resistance against damage. Levels contain multiple checkpoints. When one of the characters dies, it is possible to continue as the perished ones are revived at the next checkpoint. The characters can also collect health and blue potions that refill magic (drained by shooting fire arrows or using magic for instance). The focus is on puzzle solving and platform jumping, but there are many instances with different types of enemies such as skeletons, bats and boss characters, next to more general traps.

When World War III starts and the city is vaporized moments after the story begins, you have no hope of survival. Unless you enter another time, another place, another dimension. Escaping the destruction of London is not the end of your problems, but rather the beginning of new, more bizarre riddles. You'll find yourself in an exotic world teeming with giant fly traps, strange creatures, and other inconveniences. Time and space will behave with their own intricate and mischievous logic. You'll visit fantastic places and acquire curious objects as you seek to discover the logic behind your newfound universe.

Before you lies a small community of people and a lush, rich island to improve or exploit at your will. You can become a benevolent ruler who brings this third world country into the realm of economic superpowers or you can be a ruthless dictator whose sole goal is to leech as much personal wealth as he can from the populace before they get the courage to rebel. <br><br>Using a modified engine from their previous game, Railroad Tycoon II, PopTop Software utilizes isometric graphics on a 3-D terrain to represent the island. Clouds float overhead, sometimes throwing lightning down, people walk from their homes to their chores, and hills and forests get leveled in the name of progress. All this happens at the user-specified speed and its the main user interface as players specify new construction, lay down edicts, and keep tabs on their citizens.<br><br>Each citizen is his or her own entity, with their own names, relationships to other citizens, wants and desires. Some feel the need to excel in studies, others seek religious enlightenment, some just want a good time. They even take political affiliations and work towards those ends. The citizens of Tropico do not blindly follow orders, they must be persuaded through meeting their desires, or just pure greed or terror. If you wished, you could follow the life of a citizen from childhood through his/her teenage years, through the course of several jobs, all the way to retirement and death. <br><br>A single-player only game, there are both set scenarios and random islands to play through, with various difficulty levels including a sandbox mode that allows you to play around without worrying about money or political ramifications.

Description=Trust and Betrayal: The Legacy of Siboot, also simply known as Siboot, is a unique strategy game by Chris Crawford, designed as a study of the problems of artificial personality and a language of interaction, solving them, as Crawford puts it, "in a pioneering and therefore clumsy fashion".<br><br>The game plays on Kira, a moon of the planet Lamina. The Kira colony was founded as political experiment for cooperation between seven divided alien races. After Lamina was destroyed by a nuclear war, the colony was on its own, and a certain Siboot founded a new civilization, based on a universal telepathic language called "Eeyal" and led by a Shepherd. Now the fourth and last Shepherd has died, and there is a fierce competition between the seven acolytes, including you, for his title.<br><br>To become Shepherd, you have to collect eight "auras" in three different areas -- tanaga (fear), katsin (trust) and shial (love). At night, the acolytes fight mental duels in a rock-paper-scissors kind, where success depends on knowing the aura ratings of the duelist -- which is why collecting as much information about the others' aura is crucial..<br><br>Each morning you awake with the knowledge of one aura rating for each acolyte, and during the day, you try to collect as much information as possible by interacting with your competitors. All this is done an iconic representation of Eeyal, which allows for many ways of interaction like telling, asking, threatening, begging, accusing, promising, yelling, deriding, saying thanks or sorry or just expressing emotion or holding smalltalk. There also is some way of trading information by constructing sentences like "if you tell me the tanaga count of X, I tell you the shial count of Y" -- all this done by clicking small icons.<br><br>Each competitor has its own personality, and they fear, trust and love each person differently. Everything you do will have effects on the way the acolytes react you, so you will have to find a careful balance between getting enough information and not abusing your allies. The same holds true for the all acolytes, the NPCs are constantly running around and talking to each other to. This and the detailed interaction with them make the NPCs seem very credible and realistic.<br><br>In between all that interaction, the game is interspersed by "cut scenes" which present you with a certain situation to which you can react in multiple choice style. It offers a save and restore function as well as three difficulty and three game length settings. The game came delivered with a manual and a novella by Chris Crawford which are very helpful to getting started.<br><br>Trust and Betrayal is surely a highly esoteric and quite experimental game (when exiting, it accurately describes itself as "truly transcendental interactive experience") which is not meant for the casual gamer -- you will first have to get used to the idiosyncratic user interface and the ideas of this game. Still, there are only very few games, if any, that model personal relations and interactions as closely as this game, and it will without doubt be a profound experience for anyone who plays it.

Description=TUMIKI Fighters is a freeware side-scrolling shooter where the player controls a toy-plane, attempting to destroy enemy toy ships as they advance from the right side of the screen. There are different levels and each level ends with a boss ship.<br><br>The ship itself is very vulnerable and only has one main weapon, but by destroying enemies ships their parts can be salvaged before they drop down the screen, and are added to the player's ship. These new parts act as shields against incoming bullets and attack the enemy with the weapon they initially used against the player's ship. The effect is cumulative, so a small ship can quickly become a huge gathering of lego-like boxes. The enemy tends to adapt to the ship's power, firing more bullets if the ships become large. There is no collision detection with the enemy ships, only with their bullets. Next to a key to shoot, there is another one to pull in the acquired parts. This is used when a large numbers of bullets is fired and the player wants to avoid them without damaging the parts.<br><br>The 3D graphics are in pastel colours, with large, minimalistic shapes. It later became the inspiration of the Wii game Blast Works: Build, Trade, Destroy where the original game can also be unlocked.

Unfortunately there are a number of dangers preventing your travel that you'll have to maneuver your auto around, such as reckless drivers on their way back, likely under the influence.

Two difficulty options are provided, each with mild differences in their gameplay.<br><br>Saving San Francisco - Random fleets of unidentified fighter pilots are descending on San Francisco for no clearly apparent reason and you're all that can stop them. Manning a defensive turret you'll have to shoot each of the targets out of the sky, as well as any bombs they might drop. For each target that you destroy much needed additional ammunition will be provided, while each that escapes will cost you. Shooting falling stars will provide an upgrade to your gun. If you fail, San Francisco falls.<br><br>Sincretic - A one player variation on Pong, the difference being that an additional paddle has been added to the top and bottom, requiring that the ball be balanced onscreen regardless of where it might next bounce.

Description=When the Tuttles decide to take a family vacation to "The Alamo" they have no idea the kind of misadventures they will get into. When they ride aboard their flying mini-van they will have to avoid birds, helicopters, and even lighthouses. Of course their mini-van seems to have a crash happy attitude and frequently they will have to take on foot as each member of the family will have to work together to pass strange lands. Their adventures will take them across the desert, to jungles, up the sides of mountains and even underwater as they try and make their way to their destination.<br><br>The Tuttles Madcap Misadventures is at times a platform game and at times a side scrolling flying game. In certain parts of the game you will take control of the mini-van and fly across gradually changing settings while avoiding the aforementioned obstacles. When the game isn't in flying mode you will take control of one member of the Tuttle clan and explore lush settings trying to collect various objects to pass each level. There are forty levels in total and there are more unlocked when the game is finished. The platform levels are fairly typical of the genre, you jump around and avoid enemies.<br><br>You can attack the enemies by stomping on most of them or hitting them with your attack. Each member of the family has a different attack. The father Barry swings his empty gas canister while the mom Barbara swings her purse. The kids will have their own levels to explore as well and their attacks are a thrown cell phone for the daughter Jess and a well placed kick for the son Zach. The enemies will vary level by level depending on the situation and will range from simple lizards walking around to jumping spiders, to spear throwing natives, to breaching sharks. The underwater levels play much like the regular platform levels but with an extended jump due to the ability of swimming a small distance. In fact the underwater levels seem to borrow heavily in game play and visual design from another Divo Games release Kenny's Adventure. On top of the required items to collect to pass each level there are also bonus gems and objects to collect but only for points.

Description=For those who enjoyed the role-playing games from SSI's AD&D Gold Box series, Unlimited Adventures allows players to create their own similar games. (It is also required to play games created with it.) It was designed to create fantasy games, especially those set in the Forgotten Realms world. <br><br>For those uninitiated: in Gold Box games, the player typically controls a party of adventurers, leading them through cities and dungeons (presented in first person view), talking to people, finding treasure, buying things in shops, etc. and fighting combats. When combat begins, the screen switches to a top-down perspective where the player can control each of his party members while they fight the opponent. This is also how games created with UA look. <br><br>The basic elements of each UA-created game (called &quot;design&quot;) are its &quot;modules&quot;, that is, the &quot;levels&quot; that the player will be travelling through. The designer builds the modules by arranging walls and choosing floors &amp; ceilings, and then comes the most important part - setting up the events. The events control everything interesting that happens in the game: combats, text messages, NPC joining the party/leaving it, the party visiting a temple/shop/tavern etc. <br><br>Art is an important aspect of any game. UA comes with a lot of art, depicting various monsters, characters, items etc. but it is possible to import your own art. <br><br>The designer can also edit the monsters. There are a lot of monsters (such as goblins, dragons or zombies) and humanoid enemies (brigands, bandits, evil mages etc.) and characters provided by default, but the designer can change their name, appearance and attributes.

The game features a weapon arsenal of ten guns, each with two firing modes. Besides standard pistols, rocket/grenade launchers, miniguns and sniper rifles, there are such items as the Bio Rifle, which fires blobs of toxic waste which stick to walls and enemies, the Flak Cannon, which sprays deadly shrapnel, and the Razorjack, which shoots spinning blades that ricochet off walls. The secondary firing mode might allow a charged shot, sacrifice accuracy for speed, or even make it possible to guide the projectile.<br><br>The game also includes a multiplayer mode. Ten deathmatch maps are available for free-for-all, team deathmatch or a variant called "King of the Hill". A special mode is DarkMatch, for which one special map is available. In DarkMatch, the map is without any illumination, and players must use a searchlight to see anything. The deathmatch modes can be played against bots, and the game also offers a cooperative version of the single player campaign.<br><br>Unreal introduced the game engine of the same name, which employs such tricks as colored lighting, curved surfaces, reflective surfaces, "detail" textures (via multi-texturing), and real time interactive mixed digital music.

After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point. <br><br>The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it's called assault. These are real missions, like you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10 minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.<br><br>All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots.  Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.

Description=Unreal Tournament 2004 is the third game in the popular Unreal Tournament series.<br><br>This latest edition includes several new features.  First and foremost is the return of Assault mode from the original Unreal Tournament.  This mode pits two teams, attackers and defenders, against each other.  The attackers must try to complete various objectives, and the defenders have to stop them.  At the end of the round, whether time runs out or the attackers win, the roles are switched, and the defenders become the attackers.  A mode new to 2004 is Onslaught.  Another team-based mode, there are several Power Nodes spread throughout the map, with one base per team that houses a large Power Core.  The players must go to each Power Node, link it to the enemy Core, and eventually attack the enemy Power Core itself.  Rounding out the remainder of the game modes is the standard Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Double Domination, Bombing Run, Last Man Standing, Invasion, and Mutant, for a total of ten different game modes. An additional official game mode is Vehicle CTF, which will only appear in the gametype browser after the user adds a VCTF map in the Maps directory, be it an official VCTF map (released after the game was published) or releases from amateur mapmakers.<br><br>There are several weapons available to you, all of which come with a secondary fire.  You have a shield gun, an assault rifle (which can be dual wielded if you pick up a second one after an enemy or ally dies while holding one, much like the Enforcer in the original Unreal Tournament), a shock rifle, Redeemer missile launchers (which can launch a missile guided by you), an AVRiL missile launcher, a lightning gun, a rocket launcher and a flak cannon, to name a few.<br><br>2004 features, for the first time, vehicles, which are available in Onslaught, Assault and VCTF. You can hop into a tank (Goliath), a humvee (HellBender), a lightweight wheeled vehicle (called the Scorpion and relatively similar to the Warthog in Halo), a juggernaut vehicle (Leviathan) and several different hovering or flying vehicles, notably some space ships in some Assault maps such as AS-Mothership.

Description=As with most "Game of the Year" editions, this is a re-release that celebrates various magazines and websites awarding this honor upon Unreal Tournament.  What makes this one worth obtaining is that Epic and Infogrames crammed a huge amount of additional material onto the disc.  Although all of the extra material was previously made available for free download, there's over 50M of it so the low release price could be easily justified for gamers with dial-up connections (or the unfortunate few who didn't already own UT).<br><br>In addition to the current patch, UT:GOTY includes first of the official bonus packs which add many maps, power runes, and new models (including the Nali warcow).  It also includes professionally tested versions of the user mods "Rocket Arena for UT" and "Chaos UT".

Description=A competent one-man experiment into the top-down CRPG, pulled off with all the panache of Vampyr: Talisman of Invocation or, say, Ultima 3. The difference here is that the author rebels against the established conventions instead of playing to them, exposing the arbitrary design and story cliches plaguing the genre from the start and having a good time taking it down a few notches with a wicked discordian Subgenius sense of humour.<br><br>Unlike the irrelevant + unrelated mockery of Ultimuh, however, there is substance behind this parody: Descension's homage delivers a credible game experience, albeit one a decade or so behind the times -- the look and feel of the stickmen's tile-based overland and palace maps could easily pass at a casual glance for actual screens from early members of the Ultima series... it's only in the fine details that you can tell that this isn't being played straight.  There's nothing so very unusual about being sent on a quest by Lord Finnish (guess they couldn't afford British)... until he tells you that he needs you to recover his children's book from the dreaded monster "Bunnicula."  Is he making fun of you?  No -- actually he directs you to the dungeon where it can be found.  And sure, maybe "Mustard" is a peculiar name for a dungeon... but so is the canonical "Hythloth", so who am I to judge.  The next weapon up from the Mace is the Herring?  Well, I'm sure its smell is quite offensive.  And while it is true that I've never seen a game with an esoteric (P)ush a plant option among the character's possible single-key actions, it's implemented beautifully and functions precisely as you'd expect.  Goofy, but no worse than Space Quest 4's tongue and nose action icons.<br><br>In short, it's no less a game for its lack of stony respect for its source material, delivering everything the originals did plus a hefty dose of doesn't-take-itself-so-seriously humour to mellow the repetitive (however classic) find-the-McGuffin, kill-the-Foozle gameplay.

It's the second electronic adaptation of the author's works created by the same team that developed Mystery Masterpiece: The Moonstone. This time, there's a greater emphasis on the adventure portions, where the player has to gather a series of inventory objects to solve all the puzzles found on most locations. As in traditional point-and-click adventures, the items have to be dragged and dropped from the inventory at the bottom to an interactive portion of the scenery to perform an action or complete a task.<br><br>Some of the necessary items are only received after completing one of the hidden object scenes, that can be accessed after clicking on the shimmering hotspots found on certain locations.

The hint button is a mechanical owl at the bottom-right corner, that shows the position of one of the required objects when activated, but takes some time to recharge after use. Some locations have self-contained puzzles that appear inside a window, where a mechanism of some sort has to be manipulated directly to solve them.

The game opens in Finland, where you must assist Ingmar's friend Leif Harraldson in hiring the shaman Eldgrim.  Eldgrim tells Hjalmar that his father's estate Dynhlmar in Iceland has been destroyed and his father killed.  Hjalmar travels to Iceland to verify the claim and recover the family's heirloom axe Hildirid.  Following the trail of the axe, Hjalmar will travel to Greenland and finally to Vinland (now called North America).  As he reaches the end of his quest, even the gods become involved in his quest as he discovers his father's secrets.<br><br>Gameplay is fairly standard 2D adventure, but with the twist that in addition to items, Hjalmar's "wallet" can contain images of people who can also be used on objects or other people to solve puzzles.

These "riddles" include allocating the right laborers to the correct provinces to produce the goods needed to buy Eldgrim's services, collecting the different foodstuffs needed to survive the winter at the destroyed Dynhlmar estate, winning a game of Knattleikr (which resembles a violent form of baseball played on ice skates), and navigating the open seas from Finland to Iceland.<br><br>The game includes a reference database on Viking culture.

Description=A balloonist falls in a strange land, after the balloon is punctured by colliding with a passing bird during a storm. The deflated balloon must be fixed to escape the place. The inhabitants can help, but the foreigner must first complete a series of tasks to win their friendship using the environment and a newly adopted pet monster.<br><br>Wandering Willows is an adventure game that plays like a simplified and linear version of Animal Crossing, with elements of other games like MySims and Tamagotchi. After creating the avatar, the player starts to interact with the game in a mostly linear fashion, performing tasks and fetch quests for other characters.<br><br>Completely mouse-based, the interface allows the character to cook, sew, buy and sell items, with tabs for the inventory, accumulated designs for clothes and the recipe book. The main objective is to repair the balloon and escape. A pet follows closely the avatar at all times, and performs some essential duties like digging mounds for useful items, climbing trees to drop their fruits and use a seduction power to charm other animals. Each action takes a bit of the green energy bar of the pet, and the player has to feed the animal when the bar is yellow. The pet evolves and gets better at repeated tasks, increasing its statistics displayed at the top-left corner of the screen.<br><br>The avatar collects the items laying on the floor, and plucks vegetables and flowers from the ground. The accumulated items can be combined indirectly, some of them as ingredients for cooking, other used as part of clothing. The avatar can wear different pieces of clothing on the head, torso and legs.<br><br>Charmed animals drop random items, and sometimes eggs that can be hatched at the nursery, where the player can switch pets at will. The avatar can also plant assorted vegetables at the garden, and flowers anywhere. Garden items need to be watered once before growing, while flowers don't. After some seconds, they can be plucked and stored in the inventory to make dishes or floral arrangements.<br><br>The player receives money by selling items, or completing tasks. Money is used to buy necessary items, or more space to the garden and extra slots to the inventory. The player receives quests and tasks by talking with other characters.<br><br>The other characters have a friendship meter, that gets higher with each task performed, and by receiving pleasant gifts. Holding the mouse over each individual shows their likes and dislikes. After the meter reaches its maximum capacity, the character gives a present to the player, usually a new design or recipe. These can also be found on mounds and with charmed animals.

During almost all the time, you will seek the signs - artifacts and keys which will open way to find more keys and artifacts, and new realms. Doing so you will be able to trace the "Ancient Travelers" who were messing around long before... Maybe you will find them... So, this is the plot... <br><br>The game features 16 bit stereo, surround music and sound effects, and graphic art  (full screen 3D). You can even "explore" the CD as a music CD....<br><br>The game can  be played in one of two modes :<br> <br>1) "Challenging" (you have to find everything that is to be found), or ...<br>2) "Explore" where keys are given - and you "just" have to look for the doors...

A notable difference is that in some missions you are allowed to land and refill your helicopter with fuel and ammo. The only real difference between the two games is the helicopter you fly: either the RAH-66 Comanche or the Ka-50 Hokum.

Description=Westward II: Heroes of the Frontier, like its predecessor, is another real-time strategy game set in the old west. As one of three characters, the player has to build and maintain a frontier city while extracting natural resources, solving problems and avoiding threats.<br><br>The three hero characters at the start are stereotypes from the genre: Marion Morrison is a farmer that was forced to leave his property behind by criminals. Selecting him gives the windmill construction plans for free. Maureen Fitzsimmons is the rich daughter of a banker that decided to set off on her own. Playing with her unlocks bank construction. Terrance Stevens is an experienced  trapper and mountaineer, and using him gives the trading post at no cost.<br><br>As before, the player controls the citizens of the city by selecting and dragging a line from them to an object, animal, building, other human or a place to go. This time, the game has 3D graphics and the player can alternatively just left-click on a character, or drag a box and select group, and right-click on the way point.<br><br>Available housing makes settlers appear spontaneously to live on the city. There are four main resources: gold, wood, food and water. A few of these resources can be found scattered on the terrain, and can be collected directly using any citizen. To accumulate the necessary large quantities, the player has to build facilities to prospect, harvest or grow on logical places. Gold mines can be built over inconspicuous rocks streaked with golden veins. Wood huts have to be erected near a forest to fell trees and process logs more efficiently. Farms grow crops and produce food, and wells give access to underground water.<br><br>Buildings show hammer icons when selected, indicating the number of workers employed on them. Each construction costs a combination of basic resources. Citizens need housing and consume a certain amount of food every few seconds. If there's a shortage of these resources, the happiness level of the populace plunges, and people start to leave the town. The bottom interface has a satisfaction meter that shows their current status.<br><br>Sometimes the settlement is threatened by thieves, armed bandits and other criminals. Law can be enforced by hiring gunslingers, and later more permanently by building a sheriff's office. The main character can shoot and construct, but can't work on any building.

Description=Westward III: Gold Rush is another installment in Sandlot's series of city building simulators. Following closely the gameplay conventions of its predecessor, with only minor differences, this entry is more of an expansion pack than a full new game. The graphics are 3D, and the mouse wheel can be used to zoom in and out of the scenery.<br><br>At the start, the player has to choose one of three heroes, each unlocking a feature: a black female gunslinger called Polly Hatchet, that gives the ranch construction plans for free when selected; a retired general named Amos Cutter, that gives the gun shop plans; and Shawnee Longfeather, a half native woman that unlocks the tannery building. The objective is to build and maintain a wild west frontier city, during the gold rush years, avoiding famine and external threats. New inhabitants appear spontaneously when housing is available. They consume a small amount of food and water every few seconds, but can be employed as workers in the buildings to generate more resources.<br><br>As before, the player controls the characters directly with the mouse, by clicking and dragging a line from them to an interactive object, or setting a way point for them to move. Alternatively, the player can just left click on the character, and right click on the object or destination.  Most characters can build and repair, with the exception of hired gunslingers. The hero character can't work on any building, but can build, hunt animals and fight enemies.<br><br>There are four basic resources, and their quantities are listed on the interface at the bottom of the screen: gold, wood, food and water. Panning gold mines can be built over river deposits, and gold nuggets can be found scattered on the land and collected by any characters. Wood huts have a limited harvesting radius, and have to be built near forests. Large and small Logs can also be found around, and characters can extract wood directly from the big ones, or collect the smaller ones from the ground. Farms can be built to provide food, with optional crop and livestock upgrades, and bushes can be plucked for berries, while wandering animals can be killed for meat. Wells give access to underground water.<br><br>Some characters have quests, that can be anything from fetching something, to giving or accumulating a certain amount of resources, or constructing a specific building. The pending quests are listed at the top-left corner. After successfully completing them, they give a prize, usually the plans for new buildings, or become new citizens. Blueprints can also be bought with gold at the store, accessible as button at the top.

Description=Westward IV: All Aboard is another entry in Sandlot's series of city simulations with a western setting. The game uses the same 3D engine introduced in the second game, where the player can zoom in and out of the scenery with the mouse wheel or a button. The protagonists are Henry and Anne Turner, the daughter and son of a missing railroad owner searching for their father while expanding the family business. One of them can be selected as the main character at the start of a new campaign. After choosing one of the siblings, the other one keeps appearing mostly as a non-playable character on missions throughout the duration of the game.<br><br>The theme of this installment is railroads, and one of the central objectives of most missions is to build tracks to connect distant cities. The player controls the characters and the hero directly, by clicking on them and a waypoint on the terrain. Alternatively, it's possible to drag a line from the characters to any spot. People appear spontaneously to live on the city once housing becomes available, but also leave in anger if they stay homeless for long periods of time. The citizens can be ordered to collect any resource laying around, with some of it being stored directly like the gold nuggets, food and other essential resources. When selecting a log or a fruit bush, the workers start to chop wood for timber or harvest berries. The five basic resources are gold, timber, coal, food and water, whose quantities are always displayed at the bottom of the screen. Gold have to be spent upgrades and new blueprints on the shop screen. Wood is used in the construction of new buildings. Coal powers the train that transports resources between cities. Water and food are consumed by workers while doing their jobs.<br><br>New buildings can be selected from the construction menu to be deployed on the terrain, where they can be moved around until a suitable spot is found to start the building process. The mines can only be erected over gold veins and coal deposits. Most citizens have to be employed on the buildings to become farmers, miners, ranchers, bakers, lumberjacks or other professions, with the exception of gunslingers and the hero character. Combat can only be negotiated by the main character and the hired guns, where they have to shoot their weapons on close firefights against enemy desperados to protect the city. Dynamite can be used to explode certain obstacles, and irrigation tools have to used on desert ground to make it suitable for construction.<br><br>In the main campaign, the hero character keeps traveling by train to the interrupted sections of the railroad, where new tracks have to be built to connect and travel to the next city. As before, sidequests are added to the main objectives after meeting new characters and situations on each scenario. The sandbox mode becomes available from the main menu after completing some missions, where the city can be expanded without any set of objectives or plot development.

Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.

She married the mortal Hubert, much to the anger of her mother Angelica, and after his death she decides to give up witchcraft and start a yarn shop instead. The Witch's Yarn follows the events on the first day of her new life, through 8 chapters on 12 locations. Mixing classic adventure gameplay with an adaptation for the casual market, the player is cast as a director, steering the events on an abstract stage with cues and props, rather than directly controlling every action of the characters.<br><br>The game is conflict-based and focuses on the complex interpersonal relationships between the characters. The player selects cues from the top of screen, which are either characters or objects, to further the story. At any give time, cues can be turned back or the story can be rewound when stuck. For instance, it is possible to make Wednesday depressed, closing her store; which would end the game. Not all choices are available all the time and they depend on the player's decisions. When a cue is selected, the story unfolds through still images with text boxes. There is an inventory and mini-games to solve puzzles.<br><br>The goal of the game is to explore the different locations, compete against the other stores on Cherokee Avenue, earn 1 dollar at the end of the day, foil Angelica's plan to ruin Wednesday's shop, defeat the 8 witches sent by Angelica to boycott the store, and rebuild the bonds between characters, especially between Wednesday and her children Erin, Alec and Michelle. Wednesday is assisted by Greta, an unusually talkative fungus. Although the interface and gameplay are intuitive and more accessible than classic adventure games, a good command of the English language is needed to solve the puzzles and understand the witty conversations.

Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process). Thus your goal in the game is to descend to the tenth floor of the labyrinth, defeat Werdna, and retrieve the fabled amulet.

Description=Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!<br><br>In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Fhrer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.<br><br>Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.<br><br>Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).<br><br>Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).

Description=In WordUp, your task is to create words using the letters on your play-field. The longer the word is, the more points you get. Unlike in a Scrabble-game, the letters itself have no influence on the points you get per word. Here its a fixed value, 250 per 3-letter-word plus 250 for each additional letter.<br><br>At the beginning of a game, you are presented with your 6x6 letter playfield. Now you must find the words, how you combine them is your choice. Up, down, left, right, and the four diagonal ways, all are possible. Once you have found a word, the WordUp button will highlight, and so you now know that this is a valid word. When you send the word, the word will disappear and the letters used will be replaced by new random letters. Per level you must combine words worthy a certain amount of points, if you are successful, you proceed to the next level.<br><br>The game offers three different game modes: Arcade, Strategy, and Vanilla.<br><br>In Strategy, you have unlimited time for each level, while in Arcade, you are playing against the clock. The clock will be reset, when you reach the next level. If you fail to reach the necessary points in the time limit, then the game is over. To make this two game modes a bit more challenging and fun, the playfield offers Power-Ups.<br><br>The following Power-Ups are included in the game: Multipliers (2x, 3x, and 5x; will multiply the points you get from the word created, were the Multiplier was inside), Random Vowels (A, E, I, O, U, Y; the Power-Up will cycle through each of these), Random Consonants (L, M, N, R, S, T; will also cycle), Wild Tiles (works as a wildcard/joker)<br><br>These random Consonants/Vowels, and the Wild Tiles are on fixed positions in the playfield. The cycle through goes automatically, but can also be triggered per mouse click. To use them, you must be fast, since the tiles will change after a few seconds. Since only the full words counts, the Wild Tiles will work fully automatic. The Multipliers in the game working a bit different, they dont stay in place. Once you are granted a multiplier (will appear in the top horizontal row), the multiplier will then sink down, one row after a few seconds, and eventually disappear (by sinking below the bottom row).<br><br>In addition to the Power-Ups, there are also Hazards in the game. The following Hazards are included: Firecrackers (will destroy the eight direct adjacent tiles), Bombs (will destroy the 24 direct adjacent tiles), TNT (will destroy the entire playfield), and Walls (will hinder you by creating words).<br><br>Once one of the bombs has destroyed the letters, they are immediately replaced with new random letters. For the first two bomb types, if the bomb is placed on a corner, it will only destroy the adjacent tiles, even if they are not 8/24. The good thing with the bomb types is, that they will randomize the playfield, if you ignite them.

Description=World Mosaics is a "picture crossword" game, like Picross and other titles. The basic concept is similar to Minesweeper, where the objective is to reveal a picture on a grid by using numeric clues to uncover the correct squares that have to be filled. Each column and row has numbers above/beside them that show the number of squares to be painted with the brush cursor. For example, a column with the numbers 5 1 3 above shows that somewhere inside it there's 5 continuous squares, 1 isolated and another straight line of 3 squares. Wrong squares also have to be marked with the shovel cursor to complete each picture. The clue numbers get crossed when the right squares are uncovered.<br><br>Each successful painted square adds magical sand to the hint jar. When it's full, another hint coin becomes available that automatically paints a couple of squares when used. It is possible to accumulate up to four hints per picture, but they don't carry over to the next puzzle.<br><br>Each puzzle allows a limited number of mistakes to be made before the picture shatters and the player has to start it again.

Description=World Mosaics 2, like its predecessor, is a "picture crossword puzzle", a genre popularized by titles like Picross. The objective is to fill a number of squares on a grid to form a picture. Each row and column has numeric clues besides and on top of them, showing the number of continuous squares to be painted. By analysing the available information, the player can guess the correct squares that have to be filled. For example, a row with the numbers "4 1 3" has four adjacent squares, one isolated and another 3 adjacent ones waiting to be uncovered. Empty squares can be marked with an X.<br><br>The minimal plot is told through the pages of a diary, with the unnamed protagonist traveling to the past after finding a series of cave paintings with magical proprieties. There's a limited number of errors allowed per picture, and making more than six mistakes resets the picture to its original blank state. Each square correctly uncovered adds sand to the hourglass at the right side of the screen, and after filling it the player receives an extra hint. The hint button reveals a few random tiles. The grids get more complex as the game progresses, with a larger number of squares to be marked.

Description=World Mosaics 3: Fairy Tales is another entry in a series of picture crosswords games by Fugazo, this time using well-known fairy tales as the main theme for the puzzle drawings. Like in Picross and other similar titles, the player has to mark individual cells on a grid of variable size to reveal a basic drawing. Each line and column has numeric clues showing the amount of squares to be filled and their relative positions. For example, a row with "1 3 1" has two isolated tiles and three connected ones waiting to be painted. Empty cells can be marked with an X.<br><br>The player has to use the information provided, and logical deduction to fill the correct squares. A number of hints are available as blue orbs with feathers, automatically filling up tiles when activated. An inkwell slowly fills up every time a cell is correctly painted, giving new hints when filled to the brim. There is a number of mistakes allowed per puzzle, with the amount of errors permitted increasing in the more complex grids of later levels.

Description=World of Goo is a physics-based puzzle game where players need to build constructions using balls of goo. The original concept is based on the prototype Tower of Goo Unlimited! by Kyle Gabler, one of the developers of this game, created for the Experimental Gameplay Project website.<br><br>Rather than a series of puzzles, the game presents the balls of goo as living creatures in a universe they set to explore. They need to find out about the power source of the world they live in and the true meaning behind the Goo Corporation. In most of the levels, the constructions need to reach a pipe that sucks the goo balls out of the level. To succeed, players need to bring over a certain amount of balls or do it within a limited amount of time. There are also OCDs (Obsessive Completion Distinction) where players can aim for secondary, much more difficult goals.<br><br>Each level brings entirely new challenges, based on gameplay, environment elements, art style and types of goo balls. Regular balls can be dragged and dropped with the mouse or wii remote to form cohesive connections, but only for a short distance. Because of the physics and the wobbly matter, a solid basis is required. Balls can be picked up and moved around to adapt the constructions. While buildings sometimes timebugs will appear. When clicked, they allow the player to go back in time for one move. The types of goo differ greatly in abilities, connections and response to physics. Some of the goo balls introduced gradually are ivy goo (attach and detach at will), albino goo (four connections), balloon goo (fly upwards), water goo, pokey goo, fuse goo, bone goo, and much more. In some levels, sleeping balls can be woken up to join the construction. Constructions not only bend, but can also be broken when gravity gets the upper hand. In later chapters, players acquire a whistle that can be used to lure all loose goo balls in a certain direction.<br><br>More of the world is revealed through cut-scenes and sequences during gameplay, always with a humourous nod. There are five main chapters with different levels that follow chronologically for one year in the world of goo. The environment is changed to reflect the season. Often, players will save more balls of goo than required. These are stored in the World of Goo Corporation, a separate level reminiscent of the original prototype the game is based on. There, players can use extra goo balls to build a construction as high as possible. With an online connection, it is possible to view the height of other players. In-game hints are provided through signs that can be clicked and contribute to the story.<br><br>The Wii port supports up to four players simultaneously in cooperative gameplay. The PC port is single-player only but features online leaderboards where players can compare their scores to one another.

The Portal is only open to characters level 58 and higher.<br><br>Two new races enter the world of Azeroth in this expansion - the Blood Elves and the Draenei.  The Draenei are from Outland and having heard of the defeat of the Burning Legion by the forces on Azeroth, they have taken their ship, the Exodar, to Azeroth in search of help defeating the Legion in Outland.  However, the Blood Elves sabotaged their ship and they crashed onto Azeroth and must pick up the pieces and go out in search of more allies.  The Blood Elves, on the other hand, have come to do anything they can to stop the the Draenei and have little trust for either the Horde or Alliance.  They are rebuilding the elven capital in Quel'Thalas and have a thirst for both magic and power.  Both of the new races come with new mounts to ride and even new level 1 pets.<br><br>The expansion extends the level cap to 70 and the majority of the content is for characters level 60 to 70 with the exception of the two starting areas for the new races that offer enough quests to get characters up to level 20 before heading out into the rest of Azeroth.  There is also a new neutral city for both Horde and Alliance to visit.<br><br>Another major addition to the game is the new profession of Jewelcrafting as well as socketed items that gems can be placed into for added benefits.  This new profession works in conjunction with mining to prospect gems from the ore and create new items that can be used by the crafter or sold to others.  Anyone can place gems in the sockets of their equipment, but Jewelcrafters are the ones who are most likely to find the gems to use in those sockets.<br><br>Additional new content includes:<br><br>1. 6 new dungeons<br>2. 3 controllable flying mounts to be used in Outland after reaching level 70<br>3.

Description=In the aftermath of the events of the Third War, Prince Arthas shattered the Frozen Throne and became one with the Lich King. Deep inside the fortress of Icecrown, he then sat on his throne in quiet meditation and the people slowly began to forget the threat that was waiting on the third continent of Azeroth called Northend. But the quiet times are over as the Lich King is now awake again and sends his Scourge armies out to every corner of Azeroth. At the same time the blue Dragon Aspect called Malygos also emerged from his long seclusion and launches a merciless war against mortal practitioners of arcane magic. Now both the Horde and the Alliance amass their armies and make their move into Northend in the hopes of keeping the threat in check and perhaps even finally destroy it.<br><br>Besides the whole new continent of Northrend with new zones, enemies, factions, instances and hundreds of quests, the second add-on to World of Warcraft also adds the first hero class to the game: the Death Knight. A Death Knight can be created on every server the player already has a level 55+ character on, can be of any race and is very powerful because he can do almost everything except for carrying shields or using ranged weapons. Once the player has created a Death Knight, he begins his life at level 55 in an instanced area on a necrophyle under the watchful eye of the Lich King himself. During the following quest line, the player will not only learn how to enchant his sword by using runecrafting, he will also slowly become disgusted with the ways of the Lich King and in the end desert him to enter the normal world of Azeroth and Outland and join up with the Alliance or Horde in the fight against the Lich King.<br><br>The expansion also expands the level cap to 80. In correspondence with that new talents are available for each class to invest the 10 additional points in and many trees were rebalanced to accompany the new talents. Another addition is the new profession called "Inscription". People of that profession can produce Glyphs that are not applied to an item but instead alter the effects and/or requirements of spells and abilities of their carrier. A druid can for example use a glyph to increase the duration of his "Thorns"-buff from 10 minutes to 60 minutes or decrease the amount of mana required to cast "Gift of the Wild".<br><br>Other new features are new pvp battlegrounds and arenas, the addition of Barbershops, which allow the players to change their appearance after character creation in exchange for gold, an Achievements-system and an in-game calendar.

Description=World of Zellians: Kingdom Builder is a simplified city building game similar to Build-a-lot and other titles tailored for the casual market. The main mode has nine kingdoms, each with five cities to be built and a bonus, optional one at the end. The main game screen shows an isometric view of a fantasy kingdom terrain, that can be scrolled and zoomed in and out to show its full extension and detail. The level objectives are listed at the bottom of the screen, alongside a series of tab buttons with construction options. Usually, the goal is to build a number of specific buildings or achieve some milestones, without any time limit.<br><br>The buildings cost a combination of gold and materials, and they also generate these resources every minute once they are completed. Roads and bridges are free to build, and have to be used to connect interdependent buildings. On most levels, the first task is to connect a fountain or spring to the road network to provide water for the city. Some installations need other buildings to become available at their respective tabs. For example, the fruit stand only can be built when an orchard farm is in place to provide produce. The necessary combination of resources for construction are displayed when selecting the building in the tab, on a small table list above its button. The population increases with the available housing, with citizens roaming the streets and automatically being assigned as workers on buildings.<br><br>On later stages, space becomes premium as more buildings have to be erected on the terrain limit. Buildings, roads, bridges and boulders must be destroyed with the appropriate hammer tool to create more free lots. Some rocks contain gold or jewels, giving a bonus when pulverized. The resources of demolished buildings are automatically recycled to be used on new constructions. Trees are sacred and can't be felled. In the Free Mode, one of the previously completed cities can be developed without the pressure of accomplishing a list of objectives.

However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. <br><br>There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.<br><br>There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.

Description=X: Terran Conflict is an standalone addon to X: Reunion and the fifth and last part of the X-saga. But instead of putting the player once again in the shoes of Kyle-William Brennan or his son Julian Gardna, the features several starting scenarios putting him in the shoes of a Terran Soldier, an Argon Merchant or other combinations. As the game progresses, new starting scenarios can be unlocked. The choice done here defines how difficult the game will be, with which resources the player starts and of course from which view point the player will witness the return of the Terraformers or Xenon. And yes, the AI controlled machines are back in full force.<br><br>Three years have gone by since Julian found Earth (and the solar system) at the end of X: Reunion and united it with the X-Universe. The relationship between the long lost Terrans and the other races is still a cautious one but everyone looks optimistically into the future with more and more of the new sectors surrounding Earth being explored, populated and exploited. At least until one day a Terran patrol picks up signals which, after further investigation, are discovered to be attacking Xenon. Now that the old threat has resurfaced, it not only has to be defeated once and for all but the reason for it's reappearance seems to have something to do with one of the other races. A race for the survival of the whole universe begins.<br><br>Of course, as in the previous installments of the X: Beyond the Frontier universe, the player is completely free to do what he wants. All the already known sectors of the X-Universe and the new Terran sectors are his to explore from the start. He can take part in the very complex trading simulation by flying through the sectors himself or building his own factories and hiring his own pilots to fly transporters for him or he can become a pirate and attack the merchants himself (and become the most hated person in the sector) or play as a policemen and so on. The possibilities are almost endless with missions and other things everywhere that increase the players rank with the corresponding faction if successfully completed, giving him access to better technology, ships and trading opportunities with the races.<br><br>Besides the improved graphics, the Terrans as a playable race, several hundred new ship and station types and new tutorials, X: Terran Conflict also features a new mission guidance system allowing the player to always see in the ships HUD where he has to go next. It's now also possible to control all the menus with the mouse instead of only the keyboard as it was in X: Reunion. Other additions are the ability to form squadrons of player ships to better protect the very vulnerable freighters and the possibility to hire trainable soldiers which can enter and seize enemy ships.

It provides a real time simulation of flight using actual weather info, aircraft systems performance and failures, accurate topographical data and real world navaids (over 25,600) and airports (over 21,000). X-Plane is bundled with tools to design and modify aircraft, navaids and scenery.

Minimum resolution increased to 1024x768.<br>2. New scenery format with 5 times the number of elevation points.<br>3. Auto-generated buildings.<br>4. New aircraft format with new texture format and greatly increased flexibility in instruments. Vastly improved default instruments.<br>5. Round world terrain model that eliminates the old distortions and errors.<br>6. Major terrain upgrade: improved terrain accuracy for the US, land use data, all new terrain textures, roads, rivers, power lines, etc.<br>7. Custom scenery folders.<br><br>General Information<br>X-Plane uses the so called blade element theory (19th century) to calculate aircraft behaviour. In essence this theory regards each surface as an airfoil and calculates the forces acting upon to derive its velocity. Hence the way the aircraft handles and behaves is governed by its shape, weight, centre of gravity (CG), drag and thrust. Other flight simulators have chosen to use tables for aircraft performance. One benefit of that approach is that less powerful computers can perform the simulation. By using different factors for density, gravity, X-Plane will allow for flights in a different atmosphere. An included example is Mars.<br><br>Plug-Ins enhance this simulator further by adding for instance realtime online flying, flight planning and control. X-Plane can output data which can be fed to such as motion platforms, displays, navigation systems or home-built cockpits. It can also receive data from external sources such as RC-flight controls, Garmin GPS system, or your own flight model. Different angles of view can be output to up to 5 individual monitors (or streamed over the LAN/Internet).<br><br>The game's flight model and supplied design tools are used in visualisation, aircraft model testing and feasibility studies for real life aircraft. A library of standard NACA airfoils has been included. There are a number of companies that use X-Plane, such as NASA, CarterCopter (helicopter),  and Terrafugia (Transition - street legal aircraft). While other companies such as C74 offer design services for aircraft builders and DARPA.

Description=Yellow Brick Road is an action adventure title inspired by the Oz Books by L. Frank Baum.  The game concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King.  Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow.  Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz.  The game is short and ends in a cliff hanger designed to lead into the next chapter, Yellow Brick Road II.  However, that game was never localized outside of Japan.<br><br>The adventure portion is kept to a minimum, primarily designed to advance the plot to the next battle without any real puzzles to speak of.<br><br>The battles are the meat of the game and they are fairly unique.  The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions.  Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game.  The more powerful items act differently depending on who uses them.  For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again.  This is important as enemies progress toward the companions side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them the battle is lost and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field the battle is won and the game progresses.  Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations and against some are immune.  Trial and error combined with quick reflexes and a good strategy of making sure not all of the characters are recuperating at the same time is the only way to succeed.

Description=Yogurt Commercial is a short game taking place entirely within a single self-contained room, casting the player as an actor in a minor commercial. The player is provided with a script in the form of the game's accompanying Read Me and is tasked with acting it out through a series of cues and dialogue options. Whether they actually follow it, however, is entirely their choice, allowing them to cause whatever havoc they'd like. The director will also respond to their actions accordingly.<br><br>The game is fairly simple in it's execution, the only way in which to interact with one's environment being to walk through the scenario, verbally respond via simplified dialogue trees, or to sample a small container of yogurt.

Description=Yogurt Commercial II is a pseudo-sequel to Epic Banana's previously released title of the same name. As in its predecessor players take the role of an actor, Tom, in a small commercial, acting out a pre-defined script provided in the Read Me through a series of cues, actions, and dialogue options. A strong emphasis is placed on free will, and so the player has the choice either to obediently produce the intended commercial or embellish and even wreck it as they see fit.<br><br>The gameplay in Yogurt Commercial II is similar to its predecessor but has been expanded on significantly. As in the previous game dialogue plays a central role of interaction, however dialogue trees have been done away with in favor of an always available 'menu' system; allowing the player to speak even where not required by the script. A prop box has also been added in the corner which can be rifled through at will in order to embellish aspects of the production, either by altering Tom's appearance or by providing new ways in which to interact with one's surroundings. The director will comment directly on your performance, however, and while he may not mind the addition of a hat or harmless flower protest may be made if a death ray is employed in such an innocuous commercial.

Description=Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates allows the player to create a pirate character and participate in an online society. Unlike most games in the MMO genre, Puzzle Pirates offers an alternative to monthly subscription fees. Although there are servers which do run on traditional subscriptions, there are others which are entirely free to play on. The important difference is that these latter servers have an extra currency called "doubloons". Most of the items in the game have a doubloon cost (in addition to a cost in "pieces of eight", the other currency), and there are two ways for players to obtain doubloons - they may either trade them for pieces of eight on an in-game market, or they can be purchased with real-world money via the game's website. This micropayment system allows players with cash to spare to pay to make it easier to obtain the more expensive items, while giving players who cannot afford to pay the option of working harder in the game to earn more pieces of eight to trade for their doubloons.<br><br>Many of the game's mechanics, such as the duties on board a ship (sailing, carpentry, bilging, navigating, gunning), involve playing a specific puzzle. The better the player performs at the puzzle, the better the ship will be able to do battle against NPCs or other player-manned ships. After a hard day's pillaging, pirates can relax in the inns and play a selection of games in competition against other players. These range from card games such as Hearts and Poker to massive swordfighting tournaments. Some of the puzzles in the game may be familiar to dedicated puzzle fans, as many are quite similar to popular titles like Puzzle Bobble, Super Puzzle Fighter, or the puzzlers by PopCap.<br><br>The game also features a robust economic system which allows players to invest money in opening a variety of different shops for the production of various kinds of goods. Some of these are necessities for successful piracy (cannonballs, rum, swords, and the ships themselves) and some are simply luxuries (clothes and furniture for your house), but all require resources which are specific to certain islands, meaning that one must travel and trade in order to operate a profitable business.<br><br>The game is available for free download online, but a limited run of boxed games was released by Ubisoft in 2005. This special release added a basic offline story mode and allowed new pirates to choose one of two special items unique to owners of the boxed version.

Description=The quasi-sequel to Sim Tower, Yoot Tower is a building simulator that lets you build towers in such exotic locales as Kegon Falls (underground tourist resort), Waikiki (paradise destination) and Tokyo (the complete arcology).<br><br>The player starts on a empty plot of land and must develop it into a successful and profitable venture by inserting rooms of different kinds (from shops to condominiums) and connecting them to transport systems, all according to their requirements. When a player fulfills a certain condition (such as the number of tenants), a VIP visits the building, and if his impression is favourable, the rating goes up, unlocking more rooms and facilities to expand the tower. The goal is to reach the ultimate level, and place an attraction (such as a chapel or a baseball field) on the top floor.<br><br>There are several rooms to expand your tower, usually starting with stores and restaurants plus hotel rooms (which provide daily income), expanding to offices, condominiums and apartments and other tenancy rooms. However, all these rooms need extra support in the form of facilities such as restrooms, vigilance rooms, as well as convention centers to attract more visitors or simply please your tenants. They must be always happy, or you risk seeing them leave if they aren't happy with the time it takes to move between locations or if there's too much noise.<br><br>One of the key aspects in the game is balancing the transport system - elevators, stairs and escalators. There are thee kinds of elevators: Simple, Express or Service. Simple elevators provide floor-to-floor operation (although you can choose not to stop at a particular floor), Express work in 15 floor intervals and Service are used only by stores and general tower staff (security and cleaning).  More than one elevator can be added to a shaft, but each shaft has a limit on the floors it can cover. Stairs and escalators do the same function: short travel between floors, but while escalators are used for commercial areas, stairs are used for residential and office blocks.

As in most point-and-click adventures, inventory objects can be used on other inventory items to fix, clean, or prepare them in some other way. Besides the list items, the locations have gems that give extra points, and are set as decorations to the surrounding interface. The hint button is a statue head sitting at the top of the list that, when activated, turns and shoots light beams from its eyes to highlight one of the required objects with a circle. The statue takes some time to recharge after use.<br><br>Some puzzles take place on a separate screen, where the player has to match pairs of dice by theme, place coins on a grid on slots that match their engravings, enter a series of Mayan symbols on a code cylinder, complete a jigsaw puzzle with map pieces, step on the correct sequence of round boulders of a stone path, reassemble a shattered glass statuette, trace patterns on the screen to cut dense vegetation with a machete, and complete other similar challenges.

Description=Zoo Tycoon 2 is the sequel to the popular Zoo Tycoon, which has sold over 2 million copies. The sequel updates the graphics, but keeps much of the original gameplay the same.<br><br>You start with an open field and must build it up into a zoo. Create exhibits and populate them with animals. Build amenities and concession stands to keep visitors happy in between exhibits. Happy visitors will donate more money to your zoo so you can make it better. However, you have much more freedom in exhibit creation. You don't even need fences; a moat or ditch will suffice, as this technique is popular at real high profile zoos. There are also more animals and attractions to place in your zoo, and animal habitats look as realistic as the cartoony graphics style will allow. But the gameplay remains easy and kid-friendly as in the original.

Description=Zork: The Great Underground Empire is a classic text adventure game.  The player begins as an "adventurer" standing near a white house in a nice forest, but soon descends into the Great Underground Empire, where most of the game takes place. The player's quest is to collect the Nineteen Treasures of Zork. <br><br>As was typical for adventure games of its era, Zork does not use graphics. Instead, it communicates with the player via text, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands, such as "examine mailbox" or "take torch". For movement, the player types in geographical directions (such as "north" or "east" - or just "n" and "e"), and can check what items are being carried with the "inventory" command (or just "i"). <br><br>Zork was ported over from mainframes in the late 1970s. It is one of the first "text adventures" and is widely considered to be one of the great classics of the genre which reached the peak of its popularity in the '80s.

Description=The US government starts a competition between zoological parks to win a grant of one million dollars, prompting the park manager Zulu to inspect her establishment, making all kinds of reforms and improvements to the attractions.<br><br>Zulu's Zoo is a hidden object game with a zoological theme. As Zulu, the objective is to manage a park by cleaning cages, feeding animals and performing other similar tasks. The park's locations are shown as mostly static scenes, accessed through an overhead map. The goal of each location is displayed at the wooden bottom interface, alongside a star-shaped hint button and the list of remaining things to be found.<br><br>Most of the time, the goal is to find and click on all the items listed at the bottom. Some locations have other gameplay variations, where the objective is to feed all the captive animals by dragging and dropping the appropriate food icons on them. In some instances, the screen is all blurry with the exception of a mouse-controlled camera viewfinder, and the goal is snap to a number of pictures of the animals listed at the bottom. In other scenes, the objective is to clean an area by dragging and dropping all the junk inside a trash bin, or by using a bug spray to kill all pests. The hint button costs one star per use, and highlights the position of one of the required items. After completing each screen, a trivia item about animals is displayed and the player receives a number of stars based on how fast the scene was completed and the quantity of hints used.<br><br>Besides the required animals and objects, each scenario has stars to be collected as well. They have two purposes, serving as the help system by accumulating uses for the hint button, and giving access to the test that will increase Zulu's rank and give access to new locations. The tests cost a certain number of stars, and are association tasks where the player must connect animals to their correct habitat, food type and so on. Stars can also be received after completing one of the mini-games, gradually available through the map screen. They are common implementations of classic games, like concentration with matching animal pictures, a guessing game where the player must click on the name of the correct animal by analyzing portions of its picture and a conveyor belt puzzle where food has to be redirected on tracks towards the correct animal.

Description=Zuma's Revenge is the sequel to Zuma Deluxe, an extremely popular marble shooter released in 2003 by PopCap. As in the previous game, the main goal is to clear a series of marble strings by matching three or more balls of the same color. The spheres roll on twisting tracks that occupy most of the screen, appearing from one side and moving towards the gaping mouth of a golden skull. The player controls a frog that is either stationed near the tracks or moving sideways at the bottom. The amphibian holds one of the colored balls in its open mouth, and a reserve one inside its body.<br><br>The main Adventure Mode is divided in sequential zones, each with several levels. The main objective of each level is to aim and shoot at the moving lines to make three-of-a-kind color matches and fill a meter at the top to finish. If three or more balls enter the exit hole, the player loses one life and the level has to be replayed. When all lives are spent, the whole zone has to be restarted from the latest automatic checkpoint, usually at mid-point.<br><br>Some of the spheres are marked with icons and have power-ups that can be activated with matches. The bomb explodes all the surrounding spheres, the reticule improves shot accuracy by giving temporary laser targeting sights to the frog, the rewind arrow pushes all the marbles backwards, the hand slowdowns movement for some seconds, the lightning bolt vaporizes all the balls of one color, the tri-shot fires three cannon balls that destroy anything in their path and the laser surgically removes single spheres. Some levels have pairs of lily pads, and the frog can jump between them to eliminate all the marbles.<br><br>A boss battle happens at the end of each zone, where the opponent is an idol mask that keeps moving sideways at the top. The frog moves at the bottom and has to hit the enemy with several spheres to defeat it, while at the same time matching the moving line of spheres to clear the field. Each boss has a different attack and defense strategy, throwing enchantment shots at the frog and putting obstacles and minions to block the area.<br><br>Besides Adventure Mode, there are three additional modes that are gradually unlocked as the levels are completed in the main game. In Challenge Mode, the objective is to achieve a high score under three minutes. The top meter is replaced by a bonus gauge that slowly fills with every match. When it is full, it transforms one of the spheres into a multiplier that gives bonus points after being matched. The Heroic Frog Mode is a harder version of Adventure Mode, with the spheres moving faster and with more color variations from the start. Iron Frog Mode is unlocked after finishing Adventure Mode, and is the hardest mode where the player has only one life available to complete ten difficult levels in sequence.
