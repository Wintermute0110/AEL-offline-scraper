Description=Acheton is a home computer conversion of the mainframe adventure of the same name. Similar to Zork (which was released on the VAX mainframe not long before Acheton's original appearance), it is a fantasy treasure hunt set in a claustrophobic dungeon. It boasts over 400 rooms and 200 objects, thereby making it much bigger than Zork.  <br><br>As with many games of this kind the most time is spent by exploring the environment and solving item-based puzzles. Everything is described solely with plain text and the player interacts with the game by typing in phrases which describe his desired action, e.g. "take bottle". It also features a help function with graded hints.

Description=Events in the rural village of Ambridge have enthralled BBC Radio 4 listeners since 1950. The computer game re-creation casts you as one of the scriptwriters. The game is split into four parts, in which you control Jack Woolley, Elizabeth Archer, Eddie Grundy and Nelson Gabriel in turn. Guide each character through their decisions (from 3 multiple-choices), with the aim of choosing the most listener-friendly choices. Your choices affect the show's rating directly, as well as changing the forthcoming plot much more than in The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole.<br><br>Characters can be removed from the show depending on how you develop certain storylines, but make sure not to axe the popular ones. Avoid offending special-interest groups, as the BBC comes down hard on writers who generate complaints.<br><br>In the BBC version of the game the four parts of the game are evenly spread on both sides of the cassette tape. Each of the sides contains two parts of the story.<br><br>Unlike the other versions of this game the BBC version is the only one that comes without graphics, hence it is pure interactive fiction and text adventure, although the input is actually rather limited to choosing answers from multiple choice type questions to progress in the story than typing in commands of one's own choice and finding out how to solve puzzles to go further.

Description=The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.<br><br>The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.<br><br>By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

Description=Countdown is a Channel 4 TV show which has continued into the 2010s, despite the death of original host Richard Whiteley in 2005. It's a words-and-numbers game show, and the original format of 6 letters games, 2 numbers games and a conundrum, is recreated here. There is no computer opponent, so 2 people are required.<br><br>In the letters round, a selection of 9 letters is formed by alternately choosing a vowel or consonant, and the players have 30 seconds to find the longest available word. Generated letter combinations are not always realistic with the show. As in Computer Scrabble, the full dictionary is not stored in memory, so the game will ask if the words you enter are real. The longest word scores its length, with 18 points for a 9 letter word - both players score for equal length words.<br><br>The numbers game also takes 30 seconds, and involves choosing 6 numbers from a set including 25,50,75 and 100 as well as 2 each from 1-10. Choose how many large numbers you want, and the set is chosen randomly. A three-figure target is randomly generated, and you have 30 seconds to add, subtract, multiply and divide to get as close to it as possible.<br><br>The conundrum finishes the show - it's a 9-letter anagram, which the first player to solve buzzes in to give his answer, scoring 10 points if correct.

Description=Crazee Rider is the spiritual successor to Superior Software's Overdrive. Originally envisioned as a car racing game it was turned into a motorcycle racer during development. Players need to race opponents over different tracks, starting out at the 60th position. To progress the player has to end in the top six of the pack in a single lap. Compared to Overdrive there are more opportunities to avoid opponents and tracks also have bends. Two keys are used to speed up or down and two others to steer. For bonus points it is possible to bump into the sides of other opponents. This does not slow them down, it only provides points. Driving straight into them from the back slows down the player's motorcycle significantly. This also happens when the curb is hit while taking corners at a high speed. A mini-map of the track is shown near the top of the screen, along with the score. The current position and the speed is shown at the bottom.<br><br>The BBC Micro release contains a standard and an enhanced version. The enhanced version uses different colours, has more variety in the clothing of opponents, and contains a music track.

Depending on how well you positioned your snipers, you can use them to assist you on that mission.

Description=Victor Hugo never could have expected that his creation Quasimodo, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, would run such an obstacle course as is dished up in this game, dodging fireballs and arrows while leaping over pits and pikemen, sometimes with the help of a swinging bell-pull rope, in hopes of rescuing his beloved Esmeralda from the top tower -- all while being slow-but-steady chased across the castle parapets by an invincible knight in full armour.  Once you get the hang of any individual obstacle, the game starts throwing them at you in tandem, until toward the end you're tracking the swing of the rope, the thrust of the lance, the approach of the arrow and the advance of the knight all simultaneously!  Succeed, against all odds, and you get to do it again, but faster!  Even an able-bodied protagonist would have a hard time juggling all these threats, but I have a feeling a dedicated player with patience and good timing can overcome them.  Let's call it a hunch.

Description=Hunkidory is a platformer where the player takes control of Dave the Dungroid. who finds himself locked up in the prisons of his home planet Hunkydory. Dave isn't very keen on this and with the help of the player he starts his journey through the dungeons of the planet with the goal of escaping. <br><br>The game consists of 20 one screen levels. The goal of each level is to collect all the valves that are scattered around and reach the door leading to the next level. Dave isn't alone though as the game's 21 different aliens do their best to stop his escape. In addition to this Dave also has to avoid hitting the deadly spikes that stick out all over the levels. Controls are simple and typical for a platformer - move left and right and jump. When getting close to one of the aliens Dave can also use his shield to kill em off. Problem is that Dave requires energy to function and by using the shield it will be depleted quickly.

The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.

Description=Killer Gorilla is a four stage platform game set on a building construction site. Stages consist of girders, ladders, conveyor belts and elevators. The object of stages one, two and three is to reach the top of the screen where your girlfriend is guarded by the eponymous Killer Gorilla. On stage four the objective is to remove the rivets from the girders, causing the top of the building to collapse and the gorilla to fall. On all stages, items belonging to your girlfriend can be collected for extra points. When stage four is completed, play loops back to stage one. Killer Gorilla is a clone of Nintendo's Donkey Kong arcade game.<br><br>On stage one, the gorilla rolls barrels down the screen. These can be avoided, jumped over, or smashed with a hammer that can be collected and carried for a short time. If a barrel reaches the flaming barrel at the bottom of the screen, it will sometimes become a fireball that rolls erratically along girders and up and down ladders.<br><br>On stage two, conveyor belts that occasionally change direction carry trays of cement that are fatal to the touch. Fireballs appear from a central furnace. Ladders to the top level extend and retract. There is again a hammer that can be used to smash the fireballs and the cement trays.<br><br>On stage three, the gorilla throws bouncing I-beams that must be avoided. Constantly moving elevators must be jumped on to progress.<br><br>On stage four, eight rivets hold the top of the building together. Running or jumping over each rivet makes it disappear. When all eight rivets have been removed, the stage is complete, and the game loops back to stage one, speeding up and adding barrels and cement trays.

Description=A surreal and very original game by Geoff Crammond<br><br>The game plays out on a 3D landscape with hills and valleys made up of several levels. At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel,  a statue-like being with an energy draining stare,  you begin at the lowest.  "Energy" plays an important role,  there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.<br><br>The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. <br><br>The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze,  or rather the square you are standing on can be seen,  you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher,  and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy,  when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a "robot hull" must be created on a visible square then teleported to,  making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created,  trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground. <br><br>There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a "Meanie"  which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining.<br><br>Sentinel Returns is a remake very true to the original.

Description=Eight invaded townships must be brought back under your control in this Commando-style shoot 'em up, which progresses vertically using a flick-screen system. You are armed with a rifle (activated by a short tap of the fire button) and five grenades (used via a longer press), and must not only kill off the enemy forces, but also rescue your comrades who have been tied to trees along the way. You begin at the bottom of the first screen and slowly make your way upwards; enemies pop up from all sides, walking around and shooting, and you have to dodge their shots while trying to shoot them yourself. The foes make good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to have a chance. The levels include rivers with narrow bridges, potholes, and train-lines.<br><br>Extra supplies are dropped in as you progress through the game, as are extra lives in addition to your starting 5.

Description=Long ago, the normally peaceful land of Wizadore was invaded by the evil dragon Smaun. The arch mage of the land constructed a magical sword to help defeat the foul wyrm, but during the attempt the sword was smashed and broken into three pieces. Now, decades later, the mage's grandson sets out to roam the land, find the three pieces of the sword, and put it together again to finally defeat the beast.<br><br>The player controls the young mage on his quest in this side-scrolling platformer. The pieces of the sword are scattered all over Wizadore, which consists of a large number of screens, set over different levels connected by stairs. Hindering the mage's exploration of the surroundings (involving ladder-climbing and gap-jumping) are guards, armed with axes or bows and arrows; some of them even ride flying creatures. At the beginning, the mage is helpless, but on the way he can pick up magical scrolls which allow him to cast spells (like lightning or fire) to crush the opposition.
