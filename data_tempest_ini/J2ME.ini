Description=1000 Words is a word puzzle game set in ancient Greece. A young apprentice of Xerxes gets the opportunity to leave the peasant life and take a stab at gold and glory by challenging mythical figures and gods. The gameplay is based on anagrams. Games start with a mix of six letters used to construct words of different length. Letters are selected by moving an arrow-shaped cursor. When a word is formed, points are awarded, a meter fills up, and new letters appear on the tablet.<br><br>Next to the story mode, the three game modes can also be played in the Quickplay mode:<br><br>1. Classical: find as many words of different length as you can before time elapses.<br>2. 6-Letter Challenge: find the 6 letter word in a given number of tries.<br>3. Evolution: find words of specific length before time runs out.<br><br>While playing, players can earn bonuses that provide additional time or freeze it, guess a word for the player, or shuffle the letters. The player can also receive penalties from his opponent. These empty the bonus gauge, mirror the letters or even hide them. Bonuses become available by discovering the six-letter word multiple times, and penalties arrive when it takes too long to form a word.<br><br>There is a high score screen for each mode and a tutorial explaining the basics. The game offers sound effects and music, along with an overview map in the quest mode, and pre-game screens where the opponents offer some pearls of wisdom.

By holding certain keys, players can perform auto-defense, auto-block or auto-steal. The dunks are over-the-top, with a replay mode, and by scoring multiple points players become "on fire", with more spectacular effects similar to the NBA Jam games. Matches are rather short, and the various settings can be fine-tuned in the options.<br><br>The basics are explained in a 10-step tutorial, and the game's theme song is a digitized version of Sean Paul's "We Be Burnin".

Gameloft already released the game for mobile phones split up in two parts in 2002 (Siberian Strike) and 2003 (Siberian Strike: Episode II). Assault Wings 1944 is a re-release of the first part.<br><br>You play as Igor Marlevitch and Natasha Kalinski, two members of the Russian air force. Your mission, believe it or not, is to take out Stalin-Bot, a crossbreed of Stalin and the future MIR Space Station, who owns the vodka producing company Stalinka Corp. The company is behind a communist invasion because they produce genetically engineered vodka that completely annihilates the willpower of those who drink it. This is the original story shown on the developer's website, lifted from Siberian Strike, but in the game, you only play as the character Eliot Freeman, and the story is not further explained.<br><br>The game consists of three levels with five sections in total, a little more than half of what the original Palm Siberian Strike offers. While destroying planes and boats, you can gather stronger bullets and get the help from your companions. Destroyed enemies also leave behind medals that are exchanged for points. In difficult situations, you can activate a bomb to clear the screen. You can also charge a mega ray at all times. There are a few end bosses and a bonus level where you have to maneuver through icebergs. At the end of the fifth level, the game abruptly ends and an advertisement for the yet to be released episode II is shown.

Description=Atlantis Sky Patrol is a marble shooter game with steampunk and Art Deco themes. A twisting track occupies most of the screen state, with lines of multi-colored spheres entering it from one end and rolling towards the exit. The objective is to clear the field by making matches of three or more balls of the same color. The player controls a ship that moves sideways at the bottom, aiming and shooting the matching spheres towards the moving strings. Each level has a series of static balls outside the tracks, that have to be matched and destroyed to stop new marble lines from entering the field. If three or more spheres enter the exit, the game is over and the level has to be restarted.<br><br>Matches of long chains cause explosions that shower down various power-ups and coins, where the ship must be moved quickly to pick up all the falling items before they disappear at the bottom. The power-ups are used automatically after being collected. The Power Ball acts as a wildcard, matching spheres of any color. The Rainbow Hammer throws several balls at the same time. The Rewind moves the lines back to the start. The Color Scanner removes all the spheres of one specific color. The Soul of Atlantis shoots a vertical beam, destroying several marbles in its path. The Orichalchum Bomb explodes the balls surrounding its landing spot.<br><br>The coins are used on separate shop screen between levels, to buy helpful upgrades. The accuracy upgrade adds an aiming laser to the ship. Speed upgrades make the ship shoot faster. The bonus magnet attracts all the falling items, making it easier to catch all of them. Rewinder upgrades increase the number of bonus items at the end of each level. The disrupter delays the release of new marble strings. Every upgrade has several levels, each gradually more expensive and stronger.<br><br>A mini-game appears between levels, where the goal is to shoot the large, floating spheres bouncing around to collect bonus items, avoiding hits to the mines that explode the marbles. Besides the main single player campaign, there are modes for two players on the same machine. Team Quest mode is similar to the main single-player Quest mode, but with both players cooperating to beat each level. Competition mode has the players fighting each other.

Description=In this Marvel-licensed game you are Blade: half human, half vampire, and a feared vampire hunter. You need to track humans collaborating with the vampires, and then take on the creatures themselves with your gang of Nightstalkers - human vampire hunters. Vampire leader Danica has resurrected Drake, the original vampire, and they plan to use his blood to make all vampires immune to daylight. The action is shown with a top-down perspective as you move Blade through different locations. In the beginning of the game, you are locked up because you have killed a human disguised as a vampire. You soon discover that your interrogators, Chief Reede and Dr. Vance, are slaves of the vampires themselves.<br><br>After gathering information in the police station and Dr. Vance's lab, you will chase Drake over the rooftops and finally meet him in the Phoenix Towers. In the beginning of the game, Blade can only punch the guards, but your team members Abigail and Hannibal King will provide new weapons: a gun with silver bullets, a sword and a throwing weapon. Not all weapons work equally well on all enemies, so you will need to use them strategically. Health can be replenished with syringes scattered around. To progress, you often need to find computer terminals to unlock doors. These entrances can also be blocked with furniture to hinder incoming enemies. A mini-map in the top left corner shows your position and objectives at all times.

Description=Blockbusters was a popular TV game show throughout the '80s and '90s. This mobile game is a football-themed version of that game concept. The game takes place on a board of hexagonal tiles. The idea is to build a chain of tiles from one side of the board to the other. Each tile represents a question that the player has to answer. The answer always begins with the letter that is shown on the chosen tile. Each question has four alternatives that the player chooses from. The time is not unlimited though so he has to be quick in his decision. The player wins when he has made a chain left to right while the AI wins by making a chain from top to bottom. <br><br>In addition to playing against the AI, it is also possible to play two players at the same phone. The player that completes his chain first gets to play the gold run. There is also a challenge mode where the player gets to play a series of increasingly more difficult AI opponents. The twist here is that the player gets additional time in the gold run for each tile while at the same time the opponent can block tiles and thus making the gold run harder. There are four challenges in total and once they all have been completed a marathon mode is unlocked.

Description=Bode Miller Alpine Racing brings an Olympic-style skiing competition to your mobile phone. From the main menu, you choose the number of players (single player or two player hot seat), competition type (downhill, super G, and slalom), course, and skis (each one has a different effect on your maneuverability, speed, and tucking). The game itself begins at the gate with a zoomed-in interface where youll need to time 3 beeps/flashes to build up power. Each press builds up a percentage -- if you nail all three lights youll get 100% power at launch. The game display then switches to an overhead camera focused on your skier, where you use three keypad controls: Left and Right for turning, and OK to tight tuck or recover when off balance. Increasing your turn angle allows you to make tighter turns but at the potential cost of speed.<br><br>In Slalom mode, left/right motions are much faster and more sensitive. At the cost of maneuverability, a tight tuck increases your speed and prevents you from slowing down when hitting jumps, but your speed bonus is greater at turns than when you are going straight down the mountain. The energy meter in the top right corner of the screen recharges faster when you are not tucked. In Easy mode you receive time penalties for errors while in Hard mode, errors puts you out of the competition. If you hit the side areas or any obstacles you crash. Crashing ends your race in utter humiliation with some harsh words from Bode himself. At the end of the race the tight tuck button can be double tapped to execute a reach for the finish line, which will shave off a small amount of time. Reaching takes energy so youll want to conserve your energy, and time the maneuver appropriately.<br><br>The key to winning the race is through effective turning, quick timing of turns and tucks, and strategic use of energy. Scores can be uploaded after the medal ceremony for an event if you win the Gold Medal. Your scores are entered into an online database that tracks the top scores and skiers. The game also allows you to send the real Bode Miller a text message letting him know that you are rooting for him and be eligible to win one of hundreds of prizes.

Training is based on four subjects: logic, math, memory and visual - with three games each. You can either take a daily brain test to play a game for each of the four subjects - less than 90 seconds per game - or first get acquainted with the gameplay mechanics in the training room. A female professor comments on your progress.<br><br>Each game has a timer, so you have to find the balance between accuracy and speed. Answering is done by moving a cursor between the possibilities and pressing a button. For each game, your overall progress is tracked in charts - either globally or for each subject. If you do well, new games are opened up in the practice room - with three difficulty levels -, and your overall brain percentage is raised, along with the levels of the individual subjects. That way, you get more difficult games for each subject based on your overall performance. For instance: if your memory is very lacking, but you are strong at maths, you can continue playing at a low memory level until it improves, while having difficult math games at the same time.<br><br>The following 12 mini-games are included:<br><br>1. Logic - Balanced: different scales and (piled) objects are shown. Determine the heaviest according to the scales.<br><br>2. Logic - Magic Rule: determine the logical rule applied to a figure based on two examples.<br><br>3. Logic - Impression: identify which impression a wheel would leave if rolled across a surface, starting from the bottom.<br><br>4. Math - Trout Route: a math operator is shown at the top of the screen. Create a trail in a grid of numbers according to the operator.<br><br>5. Math - Arithmetic: identify the operator or number needed to complete each equation.<br><br>6. Math - Tick Tock: calculate how much time has passed between the two clocks.<br><br>7. Memory - Travelling: memorize and repeat a sequence of arrows with different colours shown on the screen.<br><br>8. Memory - Hocus Pocus: determine which block disappears after the blocks pass through a bar. Blocks have different shapes and colours.<br><br>9. Memory - Order: remember what figure occurred where in a sequence.<br><br>10. Visual - Ascending: four groups of scattered tiles with different colours are shown.

While performing tasks such as defeating specific targets, capturing a tank or clearing areas, you are assisted by AI-controlled teammates who fight along, ask you to provide cover, or who engage enemies in large battles. For the larger part, you're still on your own. By destroying crates, you collect health packs and ammo, as well as new weapons such as a bazooka or a flamethrower. You can walk and fire in eight directions with the addition of a grenade to blow up buildings from a distance. There are also barrels scattered around offering an explosive solution when enemies come close to them.<br><br>Your opponents have similar weapons and usually outnumber you. Stationary machine guns can be captured, as well as tanks. These tanks have a machine gun that fires automatically if you rotate the turret in the right direction, along with a limited amount of powerful shells used to clear areas and defeat enemy tanks. Missions are introduced through short cutscenes and the game is automatically saved at checkpoints. The game rewards you for successive kills (combos) and quick shots. The missions often have multiple levels and you are sometimes attacked from the air by bombers. The colourful graphics remind of the Metal Slug series.

Description=Bubble Bash! is a modern take on the Bust-a-Move concept with a tropical setting. The playing field consists of several bubbles of different colours. Usually, the aim of the game is to remove all bubbles by linking three bubbles of the same colour to destroy them. You either only have a limited amount of time, or have to prevent the packs of bubbles from reaching the bottom of the screen. Bubbles are launched by the teamwork of three characters. Crab holds the bubble and the other two, Kale and Malia, place it on a pedestal and swing it into the field with a stick.<br><br>The game improves on the concept with the addition of balloons. Instead of a fixed rectangular playing field, there are different floating sections of bubbles held up by a balloon. Certain game types require you to hit the balloon or you can wait until two sections approach each other to launch a bubble in between and cause a chain reaction. Advanced strategies require you to launch bubbles against the bouncing sides of the field, or you can link bubbles near the top of the pack to drag along the ones underneath with the explosion. There are also birds flying by. These can be hit, but they also return all bubbles shot into the void to randomly insert them in the field. The direction of the bubbles you launch is shown by a small guiding line.<br><br>Next to the regular bubbles, there are (super) bomb bubbles (destroys everything it touches), mine bubbles (explodes when hit by another bubble), chameleon bubbles (takes the same colour as the bubbles it comes in contact with), colour bomb bubbles (when hit, it destroys all bubbles of a specific colour), ice bomb bubbles (freezes every bubble it hits), wave bubbles (destroys all bubbles on the same row), balloon inflate/deflate bubbles (lowers or rises the balloons), hidden bubbles (they only show their colour when hit), gift bubbles (releases a collectible item when destroyed), flower bubbles (creates a flower of bubbles of an identical colour), move bubbles, switch bubbles and solid or semi-solid bubbles that are hard to remove.<br><br>The main aim of the game is to help Kale and Malia discover treasure on Bubble Island. By completing sections of the island, you collect pieces of a map. Each section consists of three progressively unlocked tiers of games. After finishing the first two tiers with five games each, a boss level becomes available. The different variations require you to release balloons as fast as possible, burst all bubbles while the characters' platform rises near the top of the screen, clear a screen of bubbles hidden every few seconds, or shoot passing birds holding balloons. New levels and outfits for the characters are unlocked by completing games and gathering collectible items. There is a tutorial explaining the basics and the Crab Fever mode to keep playing a single game until you are bust. The game's theme song is a digitized version of Nena's 99 Luftballons.

Description=The basic Diamond Mine / Bejewelled gameplay is used here - presented with a grid of icons, you must swap adjacent pairs so as to create horizontal or vertical sequences of three. These are removed from play, causing other tiles to drop into place - ideally forming new lines as they land. Burger Rush takes the concept in a new direction; you are Heidi, who is so frustrated with the poor quality of burgers on sale in most fast-food outlets that she starts her own enterprise. The game lasts for 50 days (with a new location after every 10), with minimum and expert cash targets to be reached. <br><br>As you play the game, people come in and make orders, each of which requires a certain number of icons to make (7 beef, 5 tomato and 6 lettuce, for example).  Making matches on the grid removes the matched tiles from play (with cash bonuses for combos). Once enough of the icons have been matched to complete the burger, it becomes ready for you to click on - this gives it to the customer and produces the cash. Up to four orders are produced at once - when the first burger has enough beef (for example) any remaining matches go onto the second one. Customers are impatient - the value of an order drops as you take too long, and angry customers can leave without paying once their patience runs out.<br><br>What good would a burger joint be without chips or drinks? None, so they are implemented in Burger Rush, as bonus items. Matches made on the game board gradually fill the drinks and chip machines, and once ready those items can be added to an order, so as to produce bonus cash.<br><br>The game board also contains tokens, which you can collect and then spend in the shop after each level. New more-profitable recipes can be bought, as can upgrades to you drinks and chips machines (which allow these to be produced more quickly, and for more profit each time). You can also buy sweets, cookies and apple pie, which can be given to customers to restore their moods.

Description=The mobile version turns the Call of Duty franchise into a Commandos-like squad-based shooter. With a group of allied soldiers, you have to take on the Nazi Wehrmacht in missions all over Europe, from D-Day to a tank factory, the Pegasus bridge, crossing the Volga river and infiltration missions in a P.O.W. camp and a dam. Before each assignment, you are given a short introduction of the environment and a team selection is suggested based on their abilities. You can only select three team members per mission.<br><br>The objective is always to reach a spot marked by a red flag with as many team members alive as possible. The different classes include infantry, a sniper, an engineer, a medic and a commando. You control only one unit at a time, but you can order the other ones to follow you or to take cover. The other members are controlled by the computer's AI and will engage enemy soldiers on sight if you order them to follow you. You can switch between team members to move them around or to use their special abilities. All members can fire regular bullets, in four directions, but a medic can heal your soldiers, the sniper can shoot the entire screen when there is a clean line of fire, the infantry has grenades to blow up objects or doors and the engineer carries heavy explosives. The final unit, the commando, can pass through locked doors and stays undetected for ten seconds in a new room. This time frame can be used to sneak up on enemies and take them out with your knife.<br><br>Each unit has an armour class and you can pick up items on the battlefield: a medi-pack to restore health, a crate to restock your secondary weapon and a flak jacket granting invincibility for ten seconds. Although it is sometimes possible to finish missions with a single unit, you will often need the different classes to get past obstacles. There is only one type of enemy soldier and they can shoot in eight directions. The fastest time per mission is stored as a challenge to beat.

Description=In the mobile version of Call of Duty 2, you take the roles of various soldiers fighting through the World War II. There's four years (1942-1945), each one with two soldiers to choose from, each with their own set of missions. Everything but the first missions are locked, and you have to complete them to unlock them later ones, eventually unlocking the next year as soon as you finish every mission in the earlier one.<br><br>The missions can vary wildly, from location to objective and weapons. In some missions you have a team of soldiers to help you out, in others you have to work solo. You'll be instructed along the mission on what to do, as well as receiving hints and tips on how to do it. You may have to take down the enemy troops, call in airstrikes, hide from bomber attacks, destroy enemy vehicles or even be left all alone sniping enemy units. The time you take to beat them is stored so you can try to beat the default "best time" or your own best time.<br><br>The game works in a pseudo top-down view, since the game works like a 2D top-down but the scenario is rather 3D. Most of the maps are similar, having you start on the bottom and having to make your way up to the top to progress through the mission. You can crawl under sandbags or hide behind buildings for cover, and sometimes there's medics spread around to assist you. The weapons are varied, from pistols, machine guns, sniper, bazooka or even a walkie-talkie to call in airstrikes. Most of the weapons simply fire forward, but to help you aim, some can "auto-point" at nearby targets, and others have a reticule that you move around with the D-Pad.

Unlike other tile matching games, you don't move the tile (in this case the Chuzzle), but you actually move the entire row so that you get 3 same colored Chuzzles in a group. They then "explode" and the gap is filled with new Chuzzles. Row moving is possible due to the fact that the rows (both horizontal and vertical) are "round", meaning that moving the outer left Chuzzle one tile to the left will result in appearing of it at the outer right position.<br><br>The four different game modes are: Classic, Speed, Zen and Mind Bender.<br><br>Classic works like explained above, but you will also face mega Chuzzles (2x2 tiles big) which can't move out of the screen and locks, which will lock the two rows where it is located. Locks can be destroyed by making a match (mega Chuzzles by the way too). The game mode is level based. Just score as much points as needed for the level and you proceed with the next one. If you run out of possible matches, you can scramble the screen (basically this equals the lost of a life).<br><br>Speed is like Classic, but you play against the clock. With each match, the counter is set a bit back, but as soon as the counter reaches the top, one Chuzzle will be locked. This goes until no moves are possible. Once you completed the level, the locks are reset.<br><br>Zen is a relaxing mode. No locks and no clock.<br><br>In Mind Bender, you job is to recreate a certain given pattern with your 36 Chuzzles. No clock and no special level order required to play.<br><br>For the first three game modes, if you don't know any further, you can buy a hint (reduction of the score).<br><br>The major feature of the game are the trophies. In the Trophy Room, you see 22 placeholders for trophies, which will be awarded as soon as you met the requirements. Those are for example for seven-step cascades (you make one match, which will trigger six additional matches), beating 10 levels of Classic, making a six tiles long match, or playing a game without using a hint and much much more.

Just like the PC game the player gets to command the Able Company through some of the most important battles of the Normandy Campaign, from the D-Day landings to the last battles of the war.

Available unit types depend on the mission, but can include riflemen, snipers, machine gunners, bazookas as well as different kinds of tanks. The actual battle starts with a deploy mode where the player chooses the starting positions of his units. Once this is done it is time for the action where for each turn the player can issue a command to each unit. In addition to the common commands move and attack (which can also be executed at the same time) there are also commands for ambushing, suppressing fire, airstrikes and calling medics. <br><br>In addition to the campaign there are two other game modes: random battle and skirmish battle.

John Constantine went to hell and back, and he has been given the burdensome gift of recognizing both angels and demons on earth. He uses this ability to exorcise demons possessing humans, but when his friend Beeman is kidnapped and John is ambushed, he goes after one of the demon leaders: Balthazar.<br><br>The story is based on both the book and the film, and includes many familiar locations and characters. However, major elements of the film, such as the relationship with the cop Angela, have been left out, and the introduction mentions a girlfriend called Ellie. She is John's girlfriend in the comic book, and not mentioned in the film. Still, you'll act out many of film's scenes, including exorcising a demon from the Spanish woman Lopez, meeting Papa Midnite at his club that acts as a safe zone for both sides, and fighting the demon Balthazar. John can also cross over to hell, through water.<br><br>The game is shown through a top-down view. You spend most of the time fighting demons. The creatures are usually hidden from view, and when your awareness meter flashes, you can activate Illumination magic to reveal them. John can also cast Groundswell to attack multiple enemies at once, and Shadowstride (invisibility) to sneak around. In regular combat, you use your fists and a holy shotgun. Magic can only be used scarcely as it needs to regenerate. The game consists of eight short chapters. To advance, you have to talk to other characters to get on Balthazar's trail. Next to the use of magic, the fighting and the sneaking, there also a sequence where you have to perform exorcism by copying increasingly longer key patterns. After finishing a section, your progress is saved automatically.

Description=Crazy Balls is a puzzle game where the player has to navigate a number of balls through labyrinth-like levels. The game is viewed from a top-down perspective of the labyrinth and each level starts with the player having control of an orange ball that can be moved anywhere where there is space. There is also purple balls that are scattered throughout the levels and these will stick to the player's ball when touched. Due to thin passages of the labyrinth the more balls stuck together the harder it will be to navigate. In addition to moving his balls around, the player can rotate the balls clockwise to avoid getting stuck. The levels are designed so that the player often doesn't have enough space to rotate and therefore doing this at the right position is crucial for progressing through the levels. It's also important to consider how the balls are stuck together. A big block of balls won't fit through some of the narrow passages while having them all in a line might make it impossible to rotate them. A level is completed when all purple balls have been connected to the orange ball.

Description=Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks.  They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!<br><br>Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him.  Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid.  Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him.  Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map.  In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited.  Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.<br><br>Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision.  Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death.  (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)<br><br>Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon.  Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.

The player also has weapon proficiencies which improve the more the player uses a particular weapon. Daggers deal low damage but provide very quick attacks - useful if you have a good chance of stunning an opponent every successful attack. On the other end of the scale, two-handed weapons provide large damage but with a much slower attack rate. These can be particularly useful if you have a good life-leeching rate. Single handed weapons allow you to carry a shield which dramatically increases your chance to parry an attack.<br><br>The multitude of weapons, modifiers and items in the game allow the player to complete the game in a manner that suits them and provides several different playing strategies.

Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.<br><br>The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...<br><br>Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. <br><br>In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. <br><br>Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.

The gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. Each cup you compete in is a ladder of 16 steps, each representing a question. These are divided in four stages, where the last one is called the finals. Four each successful question you are awarded with fame points. The higher up on the ladder you are the more fame points you will get. These points can then be used to unlock more cups. <br><br>For each question, you will have four alternatives to choose from. You then have 30 seconds to pick the right one. If the question is too hard for you, you can use one of four lifelines. The first three are available right from the start. These are coin toss, where two of the wrong alternatives are removed, ask the coach, where you make a call to your former coach,  and ask the fans, where the audience will say what they think. The fourth one is unlocked after completing two stages. It's a penalty shootout, where you have to beat your opponent in best of five. You'll control both the shooter and the keeper.

Description=Hip Hop Immortals is a mobile game in which wannabe Hip Hop stars begin their careers in beat-up apartments in the 1970s and, by earning points in the three included mini-games (MCing, Breakdancing, and Graffiti), rise to fame and fortune through the 80s, 90s and into the 00s. <br><br>The MCing mini-game is the most unique of the three, consisting of a  third-person view of the game's main character rapping in a setting corresponding to the character's success level and the current era of the game. The lyrics of the song scroll along the screen above the character's head, occasionally featuring blank spaces, which are filled by selecting an appropriate word using the d-pad's four direction buttons. The selection is then graded based upon speed of entry, rhyming, metre and (of course) whether the resulting lyric makes sense and points are assigned.<br><br>The other two mini-games, Graffiti and Breakdancing, are a small four-screen platformer (graffiti artist at work, must evade security guards) and a head-to-head rhythm-action game against an AI dancer. <br><br>The Graffiti mini-game features custom bitmap graffiti art created by famed artist Cope2 and Breakdancing is notable for its meticulous adherence strictly to moves and move combinations that can be performed in real life.

Description=Lemonade Tycoon is a managerial game inspired by the classic Apple II game, Lemonade Stand.  After naming your business, your goal is to make a profit selling lemonade.  You do this by checking the weather forecast and planning your purchases accordingly - for example, you'd want more lemonade with ice on a hot day, and less lemonade on a cold or rainy day.  However, as with real forecasts, they are not always correct, and this can send your plans awry.<br><br>As you earn your money, you can invest it in your stand, choosing to buy items such as juicers, cash registers, fridges and more to help you in your quest to become a Lemonade Tycoon!  You can also visit different neighbourhoods with more expensive rent, but more customers, which will be more profitable for you.

Description=Little Shop: World Traveler is the sixth entry in the hidden object series by GameHouse. As the main protagonist, the player has to go on trips around the globe to find and acquire assorted items for several clients. The main interface is very similar to the one in the previous titles: a static scene showing the location is presented with several objects discreetly placed over certain parts of the scenery. The objective is to search and click on all the items listed at the bottom of the screen, with a minimum of ten objects to complete the level, and a maximum of fifteen to receive a gold star.<br><br>Besides the required list entries, each scene has special power-ups that are activated when clicked. Cameras of any type make the screen all bright with their flash lamps, making the list objects stand out from the white background for a few seconds. Thermometers create a layer of icicles or a wall of fire on each visible list entry, becoming hotter or colder when the cursor is near or far from them. ? marks give extra hints, while ! points activate a power-up related to the location. In the forest, this specific power is a compass whose needle spins faster when near one of the list objects. A trophy is received after collecting all suitcases and passport stampers.<br><br>The Shake-It mini-game at the end of each trip is a new addition to the formula, where a box filled with several small items is shown from a top view, and the player has to drag and shake it to uncover some key objects. In some rounds, the goal is to find several instances of the same object. In others, the objective is to find items like dices and cards that add up to a specified sum. All the locations completed in the main mode can be replayed in the Blitz Mode, where the objective is to find all the objects from a scene as fast as possible, to achieve a high score.

The possibilities are shown through a green grid. You need to use the terrain to your advantage, as rocks can hinder opponents, certain characters have a longer movement range, and certain areas boost your statistics (e.g. standing on stones instead of mud). Movement is also used tactically to lure opponents with your archer to finish them off with your melee characters.<br><br>In the second phase, you can make your character attack, use a skill or an item, view the entire map, look at the statistics, or open a chest. When attacking, a screen shows what your opponent looks like and the amount of damage dealt. After a battle, you gain experience used to level up. In certain occasions, you or opponents can also dodge attacks. Your team, sometimes split up in smaller groups for certain battles, starts with a limited amount of items, but by defeating enemies and opening chests scattered around, you can collect potatoes, carrots, elixirs and magical items to boost your stats or heal.<br><br>Next to unique weapons and characteristics, each character has a special skill. This is either a different weapon (e.g. knives for Legolas instead of a bow, a skill you can activate at each turn) or a huge aggressive boost, such as Gimli's rage, only available once per battle. The characters' stats are based on strength, dexterity, defense and speed. In certain battles you need to fight tough bosses, or keep reinforcements into account. The opponents move and attack using the same turn-based principles and they can use items as well.

However, if you do not fall during your routine, you will be awarded with bonus points, based on how many moves youve chained together.  After you complete a routine, youll receive two values.

The point value has a larger range based on the types of moves you do and your overall performance is what is used for scoring.  Scores can be uploaded after the medal ceremony for an event if you win the Gold Medal. Your scores are entered into a website leaderboard that tracks the top scores and players.  If you are playing a Free or Overall Program, you can also assemble your own performance lineup. You can choose any of the 10 different moves and put together a sequence of 10 moves to create your own custom routine. Using a move more than twice in a row halves the point value for the move.

Description=Oasis is a strategy/puzzle game depicting the journey of an Egyptian prince to unite the fragmented kingdoms of his father's domain. Players explore the sorcerous fog that has descended on these kingdoms, uniting lost cities to fend off barbarian hordes.<br><br>Searching the kingdom uses a mechanic similar to Minesweeper, but with the difference that there are no harmful clicks. Each click removes fog from one space and reveals some information about what may be found in nearby spaces. Alternatively, once the player has removed enough fog to reveal useful terrain features, they may use a turn to instead build roads between cities, search them for hidden treasures, or take other actions to prepare for the barbarian hordes.<br><br>When the player runs out of turns, the barbarians arrive (from where?) and attack. The player will have ten seconds to move people to the nearest city (if the player built the right roads!) and then it's out of your hands. Victory depends on having made the right preparations. So while every click on the map is good, they may not all be equally good for your current situation.<br><br>The full version of the game includes the Pharaoh's Challenge, a selection of campaign games each telling a different story, and each using different variant rules on the basic game.

Description=Playman Winter Games is one of many games in Mr. Goodliving's Playman series of sports games. The game was originally 2D, but this version is remade in full 3D. As in the 2D version it features four common winter sports events:<br><br>1. Biathlon<br>2. Slalom<br>3. Ski Jump<br>4. Bobsleigh<br><br>Three game modes exist: the training mode where the player can improve his skills in each event, the single event mode where the player gets to compete in any of the events against 10 opponents or against his own personal best, and the tournament mode where the player competes in all four events. <br><br>In Biathlon the player skis by pressing the correct key when the tip of his skis touches the blue or orange signs that appear on the track. If this is done correctly the player gains speed, if not he loses speed. Shooting is done by pressing the correct number in the right order as fast as possible. Missing will lead to a five second penalty.<br><br>In Slalom the player uses the right and left keys to steer his skier through each gate in the slope. Sharper turns leads to decreased speed and missing a gate leads to a time penalty of five seconds. <br><br>In Ski Jump the player has to hit the action button when near the ramp to gain start gaining power and then once again when the power meter is full to take off. For a good jump the player needs to time the jump as near the edge as possible. Once in air the player has to balance by using the left and right keys. To land the player presses the action button again when both skies are straight. The player gets a score that's based on both style and jump length.<br><br>In Bobsleigh the player steers his sleigh by pressing left or right. A circle helps him to see if he's on the optimal spot and by succeeding with this the speed increases.

The narrative's twists and turns see the player (of user-selectable gender) searching for a missing poker pro brother who may have bitten off more than he can chew.

Description=Powerboat Challenge is a powerboat racing game. The player has to race his boat round buoys; red buoys must be passed on the left, the green ones must be passed on the right. The closer the player passes to the buoy, the more style points he or she gets and the more boost is given to the boat. When the boost meter is full, the player can use it to speed up the boat for a while. If one buoy is missed, the player loses all his or her boost charge and the boat slows down; if three buoys are missed, he or she is disqualified from that race. A style rating is also given by the end of each race.<br><br>In race events, arriving among the 3 first places awards the player a medal (gold, silver or bronze) and a prize in money. In time trials the player has to beat a pre-defined time to earn the medals. In eliminator courses the last placed player on each lap gets knocked out and in best overall courses the results are determined not only by the place in which the player gets but how well he or she raced. The money can be used to buy boat upgrades. In the beginning of the game the player can select one of four characters with different ratings on attributes such as top speed, acceleration, agility and turbo. The upgrades bought will improve the boat in those attributes.<br><br>The game features 4 islands (Richmore, Brookfield, Culu and Akonisos) with different scenarios (swamps, icy seas, rainforest rivers) and events in each of them.

Description=Prism: Light the Way is a cutesy puzzle game set inside a black hole. It is based on the conceit that black holes are the natural habitat of quantum beings called Glowbos that feed on light. When the light is blocked by a space monster, the Glowbos risk starvation until a race of light-emitting creatures called Bulboids (effectively controlled by the player) arrive to save them.<br><br>The basic principle of the game is to bend rays of light (which always travel at right angles) so that they hit colour-coded targets at the edge of the playing area (an 8x8 grid). To achieve this the player can move any of the pieces (Bulboids, mirrors, coloured filters, prisms, etc.) on the grid. Pieces can be dragged to any free space on the board (so you dont have to shuffle pieces about as you would with a sliding tile puzzle) but cannot be rotated.<br><br>The game features a time attack arcade mode (where the player must clear randomly-generated levels to earn extra time), a free play mode which removes the timer, a puzzle mode where the player must complete increasingly difficult handmade levels, and (in the PC version only) a fast-paced shooting gallery mode where targets and playing pieces are dropped onto the board intermittently, and the player must constantly rearrange the pieces to hit all the targets before they go critical.

The blocks are dropped in the same time for every player, so if to blocks overlap, then they will cancel each other out. These blocks give the player additional movement and make their character stronger if they are standing on them. If five or more blocks are in a line, a combo is achieved making the blocks even more powerful and also invulnerable against normal cannon fire. In the second stage, the characters can be moved and their special powers can be used. In the third stage the castle can fire it's cannons to destroy simple blocks.

Description=Rise of the Lost Empires is a real-time strategy game in a classic fantasy setting, with controls adapted to mobile ergonomic requirements. <br><br>Along a simple storyline involving the rebuilding of the Hell gate - which would allow the almost forgotten realm of Darkness to bring havoc to this world once again - the game offers two campaigns, each telling some chapters of the story from the perspective of one of the factions: the forces of Light (an assortment of elves, humans and dwarfs) and the Dark army (Orcs, Trolls and a few more surprises).<br><br>Aside from these mutual enemies, the game also features many types of creeps in each of the multiple scenario atmospheres: snowed mountains, scorched lands, the Elven lands, Hell itself, etc. Each faction can bring in up to four different heroes, each with different powers and skills that increase in number and power as the hero levels up.<br><br>Regular units must be commanded by any of these heroes: while they will defend themselves to death, they cannot be issued precise orders without linking them first to a hero. Regular units range from soldiers to catapults or Treemen, and their availability depends on the built facilities - which can only be built on smalls groups of preset foundations scattered over the map. Other buildings allow you to upgrade several aspects of your units or to resurrect your heroes.

Description=R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.<br><br>The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).<br><br>The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

In distance mode players skip it as far as possible, while in splash mode players get it to splash as many times as possible. <br><br>The throw is made by hitting a power bar when it is as high as possible. Once the stone has left the thrower's hand, the player takes control of it. The goal is to make the stone bounce on the water by pressing the button at the right time. Success with this will make the stone maintain its height and speed.

Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. <br><br>The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends, and trapped them inside  robots.  Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. <br><br>Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. <br><br>The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. <br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."

The octopodes are slow and easy to dodge but use powerful bombs whose explosions can harm the player even if not hit directly. The invaders also have different characteristics depending on their colour. For example white ones both move and shoot slowly while the pink ones move faster and the yellow ones shoot faster. Most advanced are the black ones who both move and shoot at very high speeds.<br><br>The game has a number of different game modes.

The settlement has been attacked by the Klingon and it is up to the player to defend it and help the survivors. <br><br>The gameplay is quite typical for a shoot 'em up. The player has a top down view of the play field and has to simply shoot down the enemies without getting killed in the process. The Enterprise is equipped with two weapons: phasers and photon torpedoes. The phasers shoot thin beams that do more damage the longer it is focused on a target. Torpedoes are more limited but their explosive damage is enough to take out most enemy ships in one shot. The Enterprise also has a shield that blocks shots until it is depleted.  It is however recharged over time if the player avoids being hit. The game includes six levels and in addition to shooting down Klingon ships involves environmental traps such as wormholes and asteroid fields. In one level a cloaking device is used to sneak past the enemy defence.

Description=Star Wars: Battle for the Republic is a turn-based strategy game set in the Star Wars universe. The player can join either the Separatists or the Republic in their struggle for world domination. The game takes place on a grid of squares where the player gets to command his troops. The troops are moved individually across the grid and enemy troops are attacked simply by moving a troop onto another. When battles commence the squared is zoomed in and a short animation is shown. The losing side will then have his troops removed. Troops can normally only move one square at a time. Therefore the player needs to use transportation ships to travel at light speed. This allows the player to move directly to any unoccupied square. <br><br>There is also other special units in the game. Battleships increases the movement range of troops and additional strength in combat. Shields add extra defensive strength to troops that are behind although they are not movable. There are also heroes that adds combat modifiers to the troop depending on who they are. <br><br>Two campaigns are available, one for the Separatist force and one for the Republic. The Separatist campaign consists of eight missions and by completing it the Republic campaign is unlocked.

Description=This mobile game recreates the events of the movie from a isometric perspective. The game has seven action packed levels that each differs in gameplay. What they all have in common are quick time events that appear frequently. The levels play as follows:<br>1. Battle of Hoth: The player takes control of Luke and has to defend the rebel base by destroying the AT-AT walkers. The level consists of two parts. First the player has to avoid getting shot down by steering left or right to dodge the enemy lasers. Once getting close to the walkers the player has to release his harpoon and use it to tie up the walker's legs. This is done by first quickly pressing the directional keys in the order that is displayed on the screen and then pressing left and right alternately to keep a marker in the middle of a meter.<br><br>2. Dagobah Search: Luke arrives at Dagobah and has to find Yoda. The gameplay here involves navigating through the swamps, jumping over geysers and dodging the flying creature that comes in the player's path.<br><br> <br>Asteroid Field: The player here takes control of Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon and has to flee from the Imperials through an asteroid field. This works similarly to the first level and has three parts. First the player has to avoid being hit by asteroids by simply moving left or right. After a while the player will need to initiate emergency acceleration to avoid being overtaken by the Imperials. This is done simply by taping a button repeatedly. Lastly the player has to defend against Tie Fighters. This is done by moving the crosshair over the enemy ships and shooting before they have time to shoot.<br><br>3. Jedi Training: Back at Dagobah Luke begins his training with Yoda in his quest to become a Jedi. This is done through a number of challenges. First the player has to run across the forest and jump over swamps. Luke runs automatically and all the player has to do is to press the jump button at the right time or he will get wet. Sometimes a liana can be used to swing across a swamp. Secondly he has to do a balancing exercise where he stands on his hands with Yoda above him. This is done by pressing left and right repeatedly. Thirdly he has to use the force to lift R2-D2 and some stones in the air. This is done by repeatedly pressing the directional keys, where each key represents an object.<br><br>4. Cloud City and Bespin Vaults: These two levels work the same. Luke arrives at Cloud City where he finds out that his friends have been captured by Darth Vader. The player has to move Luke between predefined covers and with the press of a button lean out and shoot at the stormtroopers. In some parts of the levels Luke also gets to use his lightsaber in close combat fights. <br><br>5. I am Your Father: Luke finally gets to meet Darth Vader face to face. Now the player has to defend himself in a lightsaber fight while resisting the temptation to attack. The player blocks Vader's attacks by pressing a button when a marker runs through the green sectors of a circle. Luke gains Dark Side points when hit and it's important to not let the Dark Side meter fill up. The level also has a part where Luke has to press buttons to avoid being hit by flying objects.<br><br>6. Clouds of Bespin: The player gets to control the Millenium Falcon once again in and attempt to save Luke. This level involves the laser dodging of the first level and shooting of the asteroid field level.

Description=Stones of Khufu is a puzzle game where the overall goal is to bring multiple colored stones together. The game field consists of a 10x10 field where one stone takes one grid. Now the player gets two stones which are on the opposite on the field. When holding the right mouse button he can change their position on the board or the horizontal or vertical sides of the field but they stay always on their opposite. When pressing the left mouse button he releases them on the field where they slide in the middle until they meet - this is if no other stone is in the way.<br><br>As already mentioned the goal is to bring stones of the same color together. Not entirely surprising they vanish from the game board - but not instantly. On the top side of the room is a laser which then slowly scans the field from left to ride which means the player has time to add more blocks for more points until the laser gets to the stones in question. <br><br>On higher levels there are obstacles which hinder the progress, e.g. storms or bugs. The goal of each level is to get a certain number of combinations. Every time the player beats on of the 40 levels he receives a small text which tells him the story of two siblings which suddenly awake as mummies.

According to folklore, the island is cursed and full of traps. That each path to the treasures is blocked with impenetrable stone gates doesn't make it easier for the pirates. The pirate captain however won't give up without trying, and orders his crew to set up the big cannon. <br><br>Like in Gamevil's earlier games, Skipping Stone and NOM, the game is controlled with only one button. The idea of the game is to navigate a bomb through a network of baskets. Each level of the game has two cannons, and a number of baskets in between that are used to move the bomb from the cannon at the bottom of the playfield to the one at the top. You have no control over the movement of the baskets, as they move in predefined patterns (both vertically, horizontally and diagonally). Therefore timing is crucial when you launch the bomb from one basket to another. You'll also come across different traps and obstacles, that you have to use to your advantage. Once a level is complete, the stone gate blocking the way will be destroyed and you can go on to the next level, being one step closer to the treasures.<br><br>In addition to the story mode, the game also offers an endless mode, which works the same way except that it picks levels randomly and goes on till the player has lost all his bombs. After that, the player can submit his score to the Gamevil Live leaderboard.

Once he has collected all six pieces, the player has to move back to the center of the board for the final question. If he gets the answer right, he wins the game.<br><br>To get on the category headquarters, the up to four players or bots (virtually) throw a six-sided dice.

Description=The year is 2011 and New York is hit by a wave of terrorist attacks. The police hasn't been able to take care of the threat and therefore different private forces have been created. In Zombie Infection the player takes control of members of one such team, the Inside the Action team. The team is followed by a live TV crew and has therefore become very popular. It's not uncommon to see large crowds gathering outside the crime scenes cheering for their favourite team. As the game starts the team arrives at the scene of a possible homicide, but it doesn't take long before they realize that it is no ordinary murder. A virus has been released that turns people into bloodthirsty zombies! Now the team has to go out and eradicate the zombies, find out who is responsible and save the world!<br><br>Zombie Infection is an action horror game with some adventure elements, viewed from a top-down perspective. At the start of the game the player takes control of Anderson, the leader of the team. When encountering an enemy Anderson automatically draws his gun and a vertically moving crosshair appears in front of the enemy. The player needs to time the shots to do as much damage as possible. A well aimed headshot is enough to take down any zombie. At the start of the game the player has a simple handgun, but at checkpoints he can buy new and more powerful weapons of all different kinds. There are also other items that can be bought, such as health packs and energy drinks. The player pays with points that he earns for taking down enemies. In addition to killing things the player can interact with different people and objects. Some objects can be grabbed, pushed or kicked away. The player can also pick up items that can be combined to create new ones. <br><br>Later in the game the player also gets to take control of the other two members of the team, Mike and Shawna. For each character the play style is different. While Anderson is trained in using guns and heavy weapons, Mike prefers melee combat. Early on in the game he finds a katana but he can also do ranged combat with shurikens. Shawna is the journalist of the team and always carries a camera with her. Playing as Shawna is therefore less combat-oriented and more about stealth. With her camera she can tape things she sees and then sell it as exclusives. She can also use a lock pick to get access to otherwise locked down areas. Some monsters need darkness to be protected and these can only be taken down after being weakened by the light of Shawna's camera.

You're allowed a couple of hints along the way.  As the levels increase, different colored dots appears, requiring double and even triple button presses to form the right patterns.
