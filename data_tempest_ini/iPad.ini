Description=The 7th Guest is a puzzle-adventure game which takes place inside an abandoned mansion. Venture into the 22 rooms of the spooky mansion, solve over 20 mind-bending puzzles to unravel a tale of revenge and horror that took place in the 1930s.<br><br>The owner of the mansion was Henry Stauf, a famous maker of children's toys. Once a homeless drifter and thief, influenced by a vision in a dream, Henry invented a wondrous doll, so incredibly life-like that it sold like wildfire. Stauf's toys became popular overnight bringing fame and fortune and changing his rags to riches. But things took a tragic turn when owners of the doll became infected with a fierce and deadly virus. None of those children recovered.<br><br>After this turn of events Stauf secluded himself inside his estate, stopped making his toys and never came into contact with the outside world for a long time. Something very strange happened when six people receive an invitation to a party at the mansion. By solving the riddles inside Stauf's "fun house", you'll delve into the past to learn what happened to them, and the mysterious 7th guest, on that fateful night.<br><br>The game is played in first person perspective with a point-and-click interface featuring horror-themed animated cursors (skeletons, bulging-eye skulls etc.). It is one of the first games to be released on the then-new CD-Rom media. The graphics are fully rendered in SVGA, and real actors and actresses bring the story to life during numerous full-motion video cut scenes. The visuals are accompanied by an original, orchestrated musical score.<br><br>To finish the game, you must solve the puzzles in Stauf's manor; each solved puzzle will unlock new rooms or new movie sequences to watch. The puzzles are quite varied; there's the classic "eight queens puzzle", another puzzle where you need to compose a sentence by rearranging letters, and others. If you get stuck, you can visit the library; a book within will give you hints on the puzzle. If the hints aren't enough, the puzzle will solve itself automatically once you consult the book enough times. <br><br>Some later, limited releases of the game came with a separate video that included a "behind the scenes" look at the making of the game and interviews with the developers.

Description=Bit. Trip Beat is a unique combination of Pong and a rhythm game. The game is played by holding the Wii-remote sideways and tilting it away or towards the body. This in turn moves a paddle on the left side of the screen vertically up or down. The objective of the game is to hit the various "balls" with the paddle coming into the screen from the right. The balls are synchronized with the beat of the game's chiptune soundtrack, creating a logical connection between what players are seeing and what they are hearing.<br><br>The screen contains two bars. Hitting a ball will fill up the top bar until it is full. This increases the multiplier and makes the visual effects in the background more complex, thus increasing the difficulty. The lower bar is emptied if the player misses a ball. If the bottom bar is depleted, the game switches into a black and white mode, similar to the original Pong game, where only the Wii-remote's speaker is active. In this mode, the player has to fill the top bar again to return to normal play. If the bottom bar runs out again, the game is over.<br><br>Bit. Trip Beat has a variety of balls the player has to repel. They are colour-coded to indicate their movement type: orange balls bounce off the paddle multiple times, while yellow balls only travel in a straight line for example. Occasionally, bonus items can be picked up with the paddle, which for example change the paddle's size similar to the power-ups found in Breakout.<br><br>At the end of each level, a boss fight awaits the player. Defeating the boss grants access to the next level, of which there are a total of three. After playing through a level once, it can be selected at the main menu.

Description=Kuros is an adventure game with easy puzzles made for the casual market. The player assumes the role of Katya, an apprentice sorceress that must bring balance to the magical land of Kuros by restoring several ruined glyphstones to their former glory. The game follows the standards established by first person adventure games like Myst and similar titles, where the locations are presented as a series of static screens, and player has to collect and use objects to solve puzzles. Several inventory slots are always visible at the bottom, framed by an orb with a spiral of rune carvings and four round slots for two wands and two hint lenses. The rune spiral gradually lights up to show game progress. The cursor changes to an arrow when over one of the exits, usually placed on the edges of the screen. Most locations are comprised of only one screen, with a few having two directly connected rooms. When exiting a location, an overhead map appears showing all the uncovered territory, where the player can click to be transported to any of the available destinations. <br><br>The main objective is to collect all the map pieces laying scattered around the scenery. The player must move back and forth, picking up objects and solving puzzles to gain access to new places. After retrieving all pieces, they have to be assembled on the map screen as jigsaw puzzles. The scenes have inventory puzzles, where a stored object has to be dragged and dropped from its slot to logical places on the scenery, and a wide variety of mini-games. Theses mini-games appear over the location screen, and have to be manipulated directly to be solved. They are logic games and implementation of classic designs, like a spot-the-differences game with two similar images, a Pipe Dream clone, a laser with deflecting mirrors puzzle and similar challenges. In some instances, the wand replaces the normal cursor and the player has to draw runes in the air. Clicking on certain scenery parts brings up a semi-circle of round silhouetted images, to where inventory and surrounding objects must dragged and placed over their corresponding contours.<br><br>The hint lenses can be found and collected on some screens. They highlight the exact position of one random item, or allow one of the mini-games to be skipped. After gathering all the map pieces and completing all the objectives, the final challenge is to activate one of the glyphstones. All of them have variations of the same puzzle, where the missing symbols of a sequence have to be carved on the stone using a limited array of shapes. After solving it, Katya is transported to another land and a new section of the map opens to exploration.

Description=Osmos is a game where the player controls a substance in an enclosed environment, reminiscent of flOw. By touching smaller objects, they can be absorbed, merging to create a larger substance. The substance is controlled through the mouse with a mechanism similar to the classic Asteroids. The mouse is used to choose a direction and gentle clicks, or holding the mouse button, provide acceleration in short bursts, steadily moving the object in a certain direction until touching a border or being slowed down by another object. Moving however causes to leave behind small droplets of fluid, rendering it smaller. When touching an object larger than itself, the player's substance gets absorbed.<br><br>The levels are set in enclosed environments where zooming can be done freely. After a few tutorials levels, different paths are offered based on variations on the concept. Some of them are based on aggressively tracking another organism or surviving in a crowded environment, another set is about an orbital course floating around a large object, and the final one is the slowest where there is very little space and the area needs to be captured with caution. In levels with limited manoeuvrability, time can be speed up or slowed down to prevent losing too much fluid when going slowly. Levels are usually won by capturing a specific organism (there are many, with different abilities) or growing to a certain size. In later levels antimatter is introduced, with the opposite effect or regular organisms.<br><br>The gameplay is supported by soothing, ambient electronic music.

Description=Plants vs. Zombies belongs to the "tower defense" sub-genre of casual games, where the objective is to deploy a series of stationary weapons to protect a structure against hordes of enemies. Plants provide the artillery, and can be bought with sun power, the game's currency. The enemies are zombies invading a suburban lawn. At the start of each level, the player starts to plant the available seeds on the lawn in a strategic manner. Zombies slowly begin to appear from the street at the right side, just a few initially, and must be destroyed before they can reach the house on the other side. Sun power icons falls from the sky randomly, and must be collected with the mouse to increase the funds. The sunflower can be planted to generate extra units of sun power, but doesn't have any attack power against the invading undead. Besides their cost, the seed packs take some time to recharge after being used.<br><br>There are several types of offensive plants available. Pea shooters are the basic variety, spitting a projectile forwards every few seconds. Variations appear later in the game, shooting several peas at the same time and freezing the enemies, making them move slower. The carnivorous plant gobbles up a zombie when he gets near its gaping mouth, but takes some time to do so, becoming ineffective while busy digesting the corpse. The cherry bomb explodes after being deployed, carbonizing any of the undead surrounding its landing spot. The potato mine is half-buried with a sensor sticking from the top, and detonates when one of the walking dead steps on it. Plants can be removed with the shovel to make space for new ones.<br><br>Mini-games appear from time to time. There are twenty of them, and most are parodies of well-known casual titles: ZomBotany (1 and 2), Wall-nut Bowling (1 and 2), Slot Machine, It's Raining Seeds, Beghouled, Invisi-ghoul, Seeing Stars, Zombiquarium, Beghouled Twist, Big Trouble Little Zombie, Portal Combat, Column Like You See 'Em, Bobsled Bonanza, Zombie Nimble Zombie Quick, Whack a Zombie, Last Stand, Pogo Party, and Dr. Zomboss's Revenge. After being played once, they become available directly from the main menu.<br><br>The game has three gameplay modes. In the main adventure mode, levels get progressively more difficult, and at the end of each one the player receives a new plant for the arsenal. Puzzle mode has two variations: "Vasebreaker", where the goal is to break the vases scattered on the lawn, to uncover plants or zombies and use the former to fight the latter, and "I, Zombie", where the player controls the zombies against the plants. In survival mode, the zombies attack in turns. After each turn, the player can choose plants from the arsenal. There are three types of survival: normal (one wave per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, hard (two waves per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, and endless (two waves per turn, endless amount of turns) on the pool map.<br><br>The Zen Garden stores all the available plants, where they have to be tended, watered, fertilized, sprayed for bugs and listen to music. When they are happy, they drop coins that can be used to buy more plants and other garden additions.

These zoom windows show another angle of the scene, with a list of objects to be found and collected at the bottom. Some of the collected items are stored in the inventory slots, from where they can be dragged and dropped on puzzles and other portions of the screen to interact with the environment. Mirror shards have to be inserted in one of the empty frames at the grand hall, and reassembled as jigsaw puzzles to liberate one of the captive souls. The rescued character usually unlocks a castle passage as a reward.<br><br>Each room has several puzzles that have to be solved to lift the curse and move to the next place. Some of the puzzles are self-contained mechanisms that can be solved through direct manipulation. Others block access to other parts of the castle, and require the use of inventory objects. After solving all the pending puzzles, the room is restored to its pristine condition.<br><br>One unique feature is the fairy assistant. She is the hint button, flying towards one of the required items when selected, and can also perform a series of special actions. She gradually learns new abilities that can be used to reveal hidden objects and solve puzzles. With the rock ability, she can break small containers like bottles and vases. The flame ability can be used to light something on fire, or attack an enemy. The wind ability blows away dust and other deposits, often revealing some obscured item. The water ability can be used to nourish plants. The hint option take some time to recharge after use, and becomes a skip option when playing one of the puzzles.

Instead you need to draw the snow for him to ski on, with the mouse (Browser) of by touching the screen (iPhone). Downslopes allow him to speed up, but he will climb up hills as well. By drawing downslopes ending in an upwards curve, he can be launched in the air. Doing that in quick succession allows him to travel great distances at large speeds. While in the air tricks are performed automatically when the player stops painting snow. The game builds up a score while playing, and by catching air, stars are earned and multipliers are built up. It is also possible to ski through gates and long tunnels to receive additional points and gain speed. Touching red gates kills the skier instantly, however and there are parts that prevent the player from drawing snow to ski on. Indicators on the right announce gates, tunnels and hazards. The skier is designed as a white figure with headphones, blasting rock music. At very high speeds it is possible to lose the headphones, making the rushing wind the only sound.

After nine years, the intellectual property was licensed by adventure developer Telltale, Inc. where many of the original LucasArts adventure developers had since moved.<br><br>The game is set after the events of Escape from Monkey Island and starts when protagonist Guybrush Threepwood attempts to rescue his fiance Elaine Marley from the clutches of zombie pirate LeChuck. During the fight, Guybrush, clumsily as ever, manages to mess up the voodoo recipe that was supposed to defeat LeChuck and loses both Elaine and his ship. The main goal is to find back Elaine and deal with the evil pirate once more, through a number of trials and problems that prevent him from leaving the island.

Guybrush can be controlled through the keyboard keys or through mouse movement (selecting the character and dragging the cursor to the desired destination). Only a single mouse cursor is used for all actions and important items are stored in an inventory where they can be examined. Entirely new for a Telltale game is the incorporation of the classic adventure mechanic where items can be combined in the inventory to form new objects or to interact with each other.<br><br>The game makes many non-essential references to the earlier games and contains the classic Monkey Island ingredients such as humorous conversations and events, based on slapstick, play on words, witty retorts and contemporary cultural references, conversation trees, an unconventional approach to puzzle solutions, and the anti-heroic main character. The game's puzzles include triggers based on conversations, item combination puzzles and more extensive tasks that require maps and the use of the environment. It is not possible to die in the game and player can set the ratio of hints Guybrush casually mentions while progressing through the game. Full solutions are however never provided.<br><br>Unlike other Telltale episodic adventure series, individual episodes initially could not be purchased separately.

Description=79-year-old Edward Packard, founder of the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure line and cut out of the loop by ChooseCo franchise revival, makes a bid for his slice of the pie in this expanded digital adaptation of his original interactive book by the same name which was first published in a 16-ending version in 1985, book #50 of the original gamebook line and sequel to The Cave of Time, the very first in the CYOA franchise.<br><br>The game presents updated text from the books (goodbye, pay phones -- hello, cell phones!) in several branching, forking narrative threads at the book's titular nexus of the timestream, wherein the player directs the actions and decisions of the protagonist through several junctions where they get to choose one of two or three situationally-appropriate options offered, here by touching the screen to select the desired choice.  The story then proceeds down that selected narrative avenue, with its own unforeseen complications, until reaching another junction requiring the player's decision-making input.  This adaptation not only incorporates illustrations as did the original, but the multimedia capabilities of the new platform allow sound and other special effects to be part of the gamebook players' experience.<br><br>This gamebook adaptation promises to be the first in a tentative three-game conversion deal..

Description=World of Goo is a physics-based puzzle game where players need to build constructions using balls of goo. The original concept is based on the prototype Tower of Goo Unlimited! by Kyle Gabler, one of the developers of this game, created for the Experimental Gameplay Project website.<br><br>Rather than a series of puzzles, the game presents the balls of goo as living creatures in a universe they set to explore. They need to find out about the power source of the world they live in and the true meaning behind the Goo Corporation. In most of the levels, the constructions need to reach a pipe that sucks the goo balls out of the level. To succeed, players need to bring over a certain amount of balls or do it within a limited amount of time. There are also OCDs (Obsessive Completion Distinction) where players can aim for secondary, much more difficult goals.<br><br>Each level brings entirely new challenges, based on gameplay, environment elements, art style and types of goo balls. Regular balls can be dragged and dropped with the mouse or wii remote to form cohesive connections, but only for a short distance. Because of the physics and the wobbly matter, a solid basis is required. Balls can be picked up and moved around to adapt the constructions. While buildings sometimes timebugs will appear. When clicked, they allow the player to go back in time for one move. The types of goo differ greatly in abilities, connections and response to physics. Some of the goo balls introduced gradually are ivy goo (attach and detach at will), albino goo (four connections), balloon goo (fly upwards), water goo, pokey goo, fuse goo, bone goo, and much more. In some levels, sleeping balls can be woken up to join the construction. Constructions not only bend, but can also be broken when gravity gets the upper hand. In later chapters, players acquire a whistle that can be used to lure all loose goo balls in a certain direction.<br><br>More of the world is revealed through cut-scenes and sequences during gameplay, always with a humourous nod. There are five main chapters with different levels that follow chronologically for one year in the world of goo. The environment is changed to reflect the season. Often, players will save more balls of goo than required. These are stored in the World of Goo Corporation, a separate level reminiscent of the original prototype the game is based on. There, players can use extra goo balls to build a construction as high as possible. With an online connection, it is possible to view the height of other players. In-game hints are provided through signs that can be clicked and contribute to the story.<br><br>The Wii port supports up to four players simultaneously in cooperative gameplay. The PC port is single-player only but features online leaderboards where players can compare their scores to one another.

Description=The quasi-sequel to Sim Tower, Yoot Tower is a building simulator that lets you build towers in such exotic locales as Kegon Falls (underground tourist resort), Waikiki (paradise destination) and Tokyo (the complete arcology).<br><br>The player starts on a empty plot of land and must develop it into a successful and profitable venture by inserting rooms of different kinds (from shops to condominiums) and connecting them to transport systems, all according to their requirements. When a player fulfills a certain condition (such as the number of tenants), a VIP visits the building, and if his impression is favourable, the rating goes up, unlocking more rooms and facilities to expand the tower. The goal is to reach the ultimate level, and place an attraction (such as a chapel or a baseball field) on the top floor.<br><br>There are several rooms to expand your tower, usually starting with stores and restaurants plus hotel rooms (which provide daily income), expanding to offices, condominiums and apartments and other tenancy rooms. However, all these rooms need extra support in the form of facilities such as restrooms, vigilance rooms, as well as convention centers to attract more visitors or simply please your tenants. They must be always happy, or you risk seeing them leave if they aren't happy with the time it takes to move between locations or if there's too much noise.<br><br>One of the key aspects in the game is balancing the transport system - elevators, stairs and escalators. There are thee kinds of elevators: Simple, Express or Service. Simple elevators provide floor-to-floor operation (although you can choose not to stop at a particular floor), Express work in 15 floor intervals and Service are used only by stores and general tower staff (security and cleaning).  More than one elevator can be added to a shaft, but each shaft has a limit on the floors it can cover. Stairs and escalators do the same function: short travel between floors, but while escalators are used for commercial areas, stairs are used for residential and office blocks.

Description=Zen Bound 2 is the sequel to Zen Bound.  As with the first game, your goal is to wrap rope around different shaped blocks of wood.  When the rope touches the wood, paint spreads onto it, and the goal is to paint the entire block of wood using this technique.  Once you reach the minimum percentage of painted wood, you can finish the level by tying up the glowing nail.  Two new painting elements have been added to Zen Bound 2; Nail Bombs, which are nails in the wood which explode paint when touched, and Rope Bombs, which are blobs of paint which paint the wood when touched.  These new elements add different approaches to how you wrap the rope around the differently-shaped objects.
