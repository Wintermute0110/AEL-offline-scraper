Description=Atomica Deluxe is a tile-matching puzzle game where players need to form molecules by moving atoms around the grid. The most straightforward molecule is a square form of four atoms of the same colour, but more complex patterns using different colours are also possible. The game can be played turn-based, with new atoms appearing after every move, or real-time where the game progresses regardless of the player's actions. For each of these modes, there is also an expert version with many more colours.<br><br>To progress through the levels, players need to form a certain amount of molecules before empty space on the grid is taken up entirely. For each group, a molecule meter near the top of the screen is filled, showing the level progress. Atoms are moved around using the mouse and can be placed anywhere on the grid, as long as there is a direct route possible without other atoms blocking the path. Points are awarded for each molecule formed, causing it to disappear from the grid. New atoms that appear on the grid are hinted at with a faded, coloured symbol, which can be incorporated in the strategy.<br><br>By forming combos, a geiger meter is filled. Multiple combos trigger a super combo and the different combos charge up an atomic bomb that can be used to blow up random atoms on the grid. When enough molecules are formed, the player is offered to form a more complex, bonus molecule using more advanced shapes and different colours. Upon completing it, a bonus atom is provided on the grid. It can be moved around to form a group (opening the option to get a more powerful bonus atom) or it can be double clicked to trigger it. For instance, the level 1 fire bonus atom will clear nine squares on the grid, but an advanced one will destroy more. There are also time-limited biohazard atoms that need to be disposed off quickly before they start replicating.<br><br>The game includes a high score list and saves the level progress.

Description=Chuzzle Deluxe is a tile matching puzzle game with 4 different game modes and trophies for special events.<br><br>Basically, you have a 6x6 rows big screen, filled with different colored Chuzzles (some sort of pets). Unlike other tile matching games, you don't move the tile (in this case the Chuzzle), but you actually move the entire row so that you get 3 same colored Chuzzles in a group. They then "explode" and the gap is filled with new Chuzzles. Row moving is possible due to the fact that the rows (both horizontal and vertical) are "round", meaning that moving the outer left Chuzzle one tile to the left will result in appearing of it at the outer right position.<br><br>The four different game modes are: Classic, Speed, Zen and Mind Bender.<br><br>Classic works like explained above, but you will also face mega Chuzzles (2x2 tiles big) which can't move out of the screen and locks, which will lock the two rows where it is located. Locks can be destroyed by making a match (mega Chuzzles by the way too). The game mode is level based. Just score as much points as needed for the level and you proceed with the next one. If you run out of possible matches, you can scramble the screen (basically this equals the lost of a life).<br><br>Speed is like Classic, but you play against the clock. With each match, the counter is set a bit back, but as soon as the counter reaches the top, one Chuzzle will be locked. This goes until no moves are possible. Once you completed the level, the locks are reset.<br><br>Zen is a relaxing mode. No locks and no clock.<br><br>In Mind Bender, you job is to recreate a certain given pattern with your 36 Chuzzles. No clock and no special level order required to play.<br><br>For the first three game modes, if you don't know any further, you can buy a hint (reduction of the score).<br><br>The major feature of the game are the trophies. In the Trophy Room, you see 22 placeholders for trophies, which will be awarded as soon as you met the requirements. Those are for example for seven-step cascades (you make one match, which will trigger six additional matches), beating 10 levels of Classic, making a six tiles long match, or playing a game without using a hint and much much more.

From step to step, their amount of adjacent neighbours (above, below, on the sides and diagonally) are measured: fewer than two or more than three, and the inhabitant of the cell will die; exactly two or three and they will remain stable; finally, any uninhabited square with three neighbours will spawn forth a new entity.<br><br>The player is a Newtonian clockmaker god, arranging starting conditions of cell locations on the grid and then setting the system into motion to continue, untouched and unabated, as the game plays itself, evolving, and generations of cells tick along and produce kaleidoscopic patterns, flickering oscillators and stubborn, stable little clumps and lumps (or "still lifes").<br><br>The game was originally worked out slowly, by hand, on grid paper, blackboard or using tiles on a Go board, after being popularized in Martin Gardner's  "Mathematical Games" column in Scientific American in October 1970, but increasing availability of computers have enormously expanded the options available (and enormously reduced the time and labour needed) to cell pattern researchers.

The gameplay mimics very closely the style of the original, where two players, human or computer-controlled, take turns moving military units on a map with hexagonal tiles for the terrain, trying to take hold of resources and buildings while eliminating the opposition. Map objectives are usually displayed as a briefing text at the beginning of a new game. The text can be changed from the default English to German, Polish, French and other languages.

Description=Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks.  They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!<br><br>Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him.  Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid.  Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him.  Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map.  In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited.  Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.<br><br>Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision.  Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death.  (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)<br><br>Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon.  Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.

Description=Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

Description=Raging Thunder is a racing game for mobile devices. As an arcade racer at heart, the game allows the player to try out four different cars with different abilities when it comes to speed, acceleration and grip. It's played from a third person perspective and is fully rendered in 3D with the developer's own Fuse engine. Two control methods are available. The player can either use the touch screen by dragging his finger right or left or the gyro sensor by tilting the phone. Acceleration and braking is done by dragging the finger up and down on the screen. When using the touch screen to steer it is possible to enable auto acceleration. The cars also has boosting and tackling functionality. To boost the player needs to pick up lighting bolt collectibles that are scattered around the tracks and this gives some extra power briefly. In addition to the lighting bolts there is also laughing skulls which the player has to avoid since they will drain the player's boost. When no boost is left the car slows to a crawl for a few seconds.  Tackling can be done whenever the player is close to a competitor who is then sent spinning. <br><br>The game features three game modes: arcade, time attack and championship. In the arcade mode the player gets to race through all the levels and has to reach checkpoints before the time expires. In the time attack mode the player gets to compete for the fastest time on any track that is unlocked. In the championship mode the player gets paid for the races and is able to upgrade his car or buy a new one. In the championship mode the player also unlocks the levels that become available in time attack and multiplayer. <br><br>Multiplayer is available over both a local wireless network and over the Internet. It's cross-platform for meaning that players with different types of handsets can compete against each other.

Description=In an interesting publicity maneuver for their newly-released Dreamcast video game system, Sega of America released a free game for the PC and DC platforms, Sega Swirl.  (Also apparently to capitalize on the DC's logo, a Cinnabon-like swirl.)<br><br>The object of the game is simple.  A screen fills with multi-colored swirls, and then you must remove the whole screen.  A swirl removed will also remove all neighboring swirls of the same color.  Gravity affects the remaining swirls, and the whole mass contracts to the left of the screen as you remove more and more.<br><br>Scoring is based on "combos", or number of swirls removed simultaneously.  Obviously, more swirls=higher points, but single swirls actually remove points.  You have to play a balancing act between removing huge masses of swirls and being left with non-matching sets, or removing smaller sets and possibly missing out on a huge combo score.<br><br>In a foreshadowing of the (hoped for) coming day of PC/video game on-line convergence, PC and DC owners can play against each other- via e-mail.<br><br>PC owners can download the game for free, and Sega offers it in two varieties- the standard version, and (refreshingly) a small sound-free version for people who don't want to be online for a long time.  A separate soundpack is available for those who opt to not get the whole set in one fell swoop.  DC owners can get the game free on various promo GD-ROMs Sega has distributed.

Description=Seven Seas is a top-down strategical puzzle game with a pirate theme, set on an ocean board of 11x11 squares. Players control a white galleon and need to eliminate all pirate ships to complete a level. For each turn the ship can move in any of the eight squares surrounding the ship, unless blocked by an obstacle. Pirate ships have the same movement options and an identical speed of one square per turn. It is also possible not to move and fire the two broadside cannons to the left and the right of the ship instead, with a maximum reach of three squares.<br><br>Since the player's galleon is always outnumbered, the pirates can be tricked to move inside the line of fire. Black ships also blindly track the player's movement, meaning they can be lured to collide with island reefs or ship wrecks. Red ships are smarter and avoid obvious obstacles by moving around them. As a last resort the player's ship can also move into a whirlpool, which teleports the ship to a random location on the map. Players get points for each ship taken down and later levels introduce new opponents such as sea monsters. The player start with three lives. There are three main difficulty levels and a high score list.
