Description=Armageddon Squadron is an arcade flight simulator which takes place in a fictional WWII scenario. The player controls 5 different famous airplanes from the era in short missions. There are 3 gameplay modes:<br><br>1. Campaign: there are 3 campaigns comprised of 4 missions each. In each mission the player controls different airplanes, from fighters to bombers. Each mission has different goals, such as bombing enemy weapon factories, destroying dams, protecting ally troops, etc. Finishing one mission unlocks the next one, finishing a campaign unlocks the following.<br>2. Time Attack: in this mode the player has to fly through rings within a time limit. Flying successfully through a ring lightens up the next one and adds some seconds to the counter. There are four courses; finishing one unlocks the next.<br>3. Arcade: in this mode, the player selects the airplane, map, terrain, number of enemies, respawn rate and time limit. In this mode only four airplanes are available: the Supermarine Spitfire, F6F Hellcat, Messerschmitt Bf 109, or the Messerschmitt Me 262; the bomber isn't available. Missions are completed when the player takes down all enemies before the time runs out and before a new squadron arrives.<br><br>The airplanes are equipped with different weapons, being machine guns, rockets, torpedoes or bombs. When switching the main weapon to bombs, the camera goes from behind the airplane to above it, making it easier to aim ground targets, but harder to spot aerial enemies. The screen displays a radar with info on enemies' position and two half-circle meters: a red one which measures the plane's health and a yellow one which measures the plane's speed. Onscreen red arrows will point where the objectives in a given mission are.<br><br>The main controls consist in steering the airplane (with the accelerometer where available), selecting weapons, shooting, accelerating and slowing down. There's also a camera with a target view. Finishing each mode grants the player a different medal, as well as scoring points in some modes. By accumulating points the player is granted ranks. The game offers a steering sensibility setting and the option to invert the Y-axis.

It is said that this artifact, known as "the chalice", can give its owner the power to stop the Crusades.<br><br>The game is presented as a side-scroller with guided 3D paths. That is, the player has freedom to move in 3 dimensions, as the use of rooftops will be very extensive, but limited to a given path. As in the previous game, Altaïr shows the usual abilities of combat, stealth and parkour-like displacement, that will help him to find alternative routes or fight the enemies if there is not other way. Other abilities such as interrogation and pickpocketing is performed this time through mini-games, that make use of the touch screen of the DS. In addition, Altaïr can gain new abilities through gathering of blue orbs scattered through the maps (short of gaining "experience").

Description=Bubble Bash! is a modern take on the Bust-a-Move concept with a tropical setting. The playing field consists of several bubbles of different colours. Usually, the aim of the game is to remove all bubbles by linking three bubbles of the same colour to destroy them. You either only have a limited amount of time, or have to prevent the packs of bubbles from reaching the bottom of the screen. Bubbles are launched by the teamwork of three characters. Crab holds the bubble and the other two, Kale and Malia, place it on a pedestal and swing it into the field with a stick.<br><br>The game improves on the concept with the addition of balloons. Instead of a fixed rectangular playing field, there are different floating sections of bubbles held up by a balloon. Certain game types require you to hit the balloon or you can wait until two sections approach each other to launch a bubble in between and cause a chain reaction. Advanced strategies require you to launch bubbles against the bouncing sides of the field, or you can link bubbles near the top of the pack to drag along the ones underneath with the explosion. There are also birds flying by. These can be hit, but they also return all bubbles shot into the void to randomly insert them in the field. The direction of the bubbles you launch is shown by a small guiding line.<br><br>Next to the regular bubbles, there are (super) bomb bubbles (destroys everything it touches), mine bubbles (explodes when hit by another bubble), chameleon bubbles (takes the same colour as the bubbles it comes in contact with), colour bomb bubbles (when hit, it destroys all bubbles of a specific colour), ice bomb bubbles (freezes every bubble it hits), wave bubbles (destroys all bubbles on the same row), balloon inflate/deflate bubbles (lowers or rises the balloons), hidden bubbles (they only show their colour when hit), gift bubbles (releases a collectible item when destroyed), flower bubbles (creates a flower of bubbles of an identical colour), move bubbles, switch bubbles and solid or semi-solid bubbles that are hard to remove.<br><br>The main aim of the game is to help Kale and Malia discover treasure on Bubble Island. By completing sections of the island, you collect pieces of a map. Each section consists of three progressively unlocked tiers of games. After finishing the first two tiers with five games each, a boss level becomes available. The different variations require you to release balloons as fast as possible, burst all bubbles while the characters' platform rises near the top of the screen, clear a screen of bubbles hidden every few seconds, or shoot passing birds holding balloons. New levels and outfits for the characters are unlocked by completing games and gathering collectible items. There is a tutorial explaining the basics and the Crab Fever mode to keep playing a single game until you are bust. The game's theme song is a digitized version of Nena's 99 Luftballons.

Description=A rollicking naval adventure on the high seas explicitly in the vein of C. S. Foresters Horatio Hornblower or Patrick OBrians Aubrey-Maturin series, this Choose-Your-Own-Adventure (sitting on the back of a simple RPG engine) allows the player to define their character's strengths and weaknesses through their choices of options presented, then direct that character through a long career rising through the ranks of the Royal Navy on the ships H.M.S. Courageous, Defender, and Dauntless.  The seas presented are those contested between fictionalized European imperial states Albion and Gaul, and over the course of the game players will experience intrigue and rivalry with their counterpart from the other side, Villeneuve, as well as an optional Jane Austen interlude during peacetime of finding a suitable spouse.<br><br>The skills that make a ship's Captain include Sailing, Gunnery, Leadership and Patronage, and though the RPG engine will factor in the character's calculated abilities in these fields, players may benefit from some research to successfully put their characters through their paces.<br><br>Genre conventions are adhered to sufficiently to retain the feel of the sources while being open to radical tweaking based on players' narrative preferences: in additional to same-sex romances (surely unknown among sailors!) one has the option of playing in a gender-swapped world, where bold women command tall ships in the service of gentlemen safe at home.

Description=This multiple-choice game situates the player in Iberia (a magical version of medieval Spain), the scion of an upwardly-mobile family in the hinterlands with an extraordinary opportunity to visit the royal court and make alliances and dalliances.  The player, a Death Mage, is given many opportunities to twist the affections of multiple suitors from low-born to high, around their finger.  Different family members will offer consultations, however solicited, regarding which suitor would ultimately be to the highest benefit to your family.  Different approaches selected by the player will both hinge on and influence the ratings of several statistics: Booksmart, Charm, Subtle, Magic, Wealth, and Reputation.  As with many of Choice of Games' in-house productions, successful completion of the game yields a code to be saved to allow players to continue playing as the same character in future installments of this hot-blooded Iberian romance.

Description=Choice of the Dragon plays much like 1986's Alter Ego, with a twist: instead of being a contemporary human being, the player instead makes decisions guiding the life of a fire-breathing wyrm in some fantastical medieval land of long ago and far away.  The game's title is quite literal:  through personality-profile-type questions and plenty of CYOA gameplay, a unique and replayable draconic life cycle will unfold, featuring takes on and deconstructions of classic D&D tropes such as goblin tribes, noble knights, petulant princesses, a pesky party of do-gooding adventurers, the evil spellcaster Vermias, your own nemesis dragon Axilmeus and the vengeful gods themselves, as thatched cottages, sturdy castles, bejewelled temples and unwholesome towers all crumble beneath a blast of flaming breath.The game is a bit more up front than its predecessor about what's going on under the hood, offering options and customizing descriptions measured against three variable statistical axes: Brutality/Finesse, Cunning/Honor and Disdain/Vigilance, as well as tabulating Wealth, Wounds, Infamy and Blasphemy.  Beyond the standard concerns of amassing wealth and lording over lesser beings, the game also offers intriguing tangents such as the quest for a suitable mate for their dragon.

Choosing from any of a wide variety of backgrounds, all the characters will have their distinctive abilities (measuring over 21 statistics overall, five of which are somewhat binary continuums) put to task thriving as a wolf among sheep and surviving amongst the curious parallel political structures of the vampires also.

As in some other games by its makers, surviving to the end of the game results in the sharing of a code allowing players to resume the very particular affairs of this specific character in future installments of the game.

Description=Here, the first "adventure" game continues to be ported to the latest and greatest platforms as a "hello world" exercise of sorts.  Not much has changed for this game in the past 35-odd years, so to briefly reiterate: the player directs the actions of a spelunking cave-adventurer through a primitive text parser, overcoming monsters, traps and strange obstacles with the use of handy inventory items and head-scratching magic words.  This version is a very faithful reproduction, maintaining the gold standard of 430 points to achieve after Don Woods had souped up Will Crowther's sun source.  Android being what it is, some relatively new functionality for this text adventure is the option of using speech synthesis and voice recognition to verbally spar with the game.

The bomb will be the last projectile to be unlocked and like the rocks, it will be eventually upgraded to a three-bomb variation.<br><br>To fire the trebuchet, the player must click the left mouse button to initiate launch, clicking again when it reaches a desired height to launch their projectiles.  The screen will automatically center upon the castle so the player can witness the destruction where they click the left mouse button again to return to the trebuchet and repeat the process.  There is also a reset button in case the player doesn't like how they are doing, however it can not be used if all their targets are eliminated or after the final shot has been taken.<br><br>There is no health system or a points system, but does feature a three second time limit once the player's final shot has made contact with the castle.  If all the targets are not eliminated before the timer runs out, the player will meet with failure and have to restart the level over.  As a bonus, if the player completes the game it will unlock a castle editor that will allow the player to construct their own castle and destroy it afterwards.<br><br>Chris Condon lends his artistic talents to the game.  He is best know for his online flash games including Warfare 1917 and the Last Stand series.

Description=In Dead Runner, the player finds himself in a dark and eerie forest. There is no one else around but the creepy ambient sounds deliver a message that can only be interpreted in one way. Run or get devoured by the souls that are haunting the forest. The gameplay is similar to the ZX Spectrum game 3D Deathchase. The player runs through the forest, viewed from a first person perspective, and has to avoid hitting trees or other obstacles. The running is done automatically so all the player needs to do is to control the steering by tilt the device in the direction he wants to move. Running into a brush will briefly slow down the running speed. Once the player hits and obstacles the game is over and a highscore is given. On the place where the player dies a grave stone will be placed and then become an obstacle in further playthroughs. <br><br> The original release of the game has two game modes: distance mode and points mode. In distance mode the player simply has to stay alive as long as possible while in the points mode he has to score as many points as possible. Points are awarded for the distance and for collecting pickups. Most basic pickups are yellow but there are also purple (2x) and green (3x) multipliers that gives extra points while active although they at the same time increases the speed.

Description=De Blob is the mobile version of the 2008 De Blob console game of the same name, and a reimagening of the 2006 student game it is based on. Controlling a single blob through a top-down perspective, players need to travel through four distinct city areas (residential, commercial, industrial and government) to bring back colour and happiness to the white Chroma City, whose inhabitants are now forced into dull routines.<br><br>The blob can move very fast in any direction and by crushing leech bots it absorbs a colour. Primary colours can then be mixed to create new ones (e.g. yellow and then red to have orange). Colour is brought back to the buildings by bumping into them. Ink police officers and vans can be attacked in the meantime. When touched by them, the blob turns black and needs to wash it off. Starting small, absorbing colours also make the blob larger, granting access to new areas or preventing from passing through narrow alleys. A bath will reduce the size.<br><br>Each area consists of different blocks where the blob has a limited amount of time to get a set score, based on applying colours to the buildings. Time can be extended by doing missions for characters, such as racing or painting specific landmark buildings. Based on the performance and style (such as colour harmony or time), different stars are awarded and a revolution meter keeps track of the general progress. Extra points are also awarded when the four letters that spell out "BLOB" are found in an area. After reaching the requested score, the level can be exited.<br><br>Next to the Revolution game mode, there is also Free Splash with only points as an objective.

All necessary actions are performed with clicks over interactive hotspots of the scenery.<br><br>The objective is displayed at the start of the level, usually requiring a certain amount of resources, money or other goals. Initially, the player has to click on the well to collect water and on the ground to grow the grass that feeds most of the livestock. The animals can be purchased from a tab at the top, to eat the turf and generate products every few moments. Geese lay eggs, sheep shed cotton, cows produce milk, and all these resources have to be collected and stacked on boxes at the bottom storage shed. The boxes have to be shipped to the market by clicking on the truck, that takes a few moments to make the transportation of all the selected goods. A small animation at the bottom-right shows the vehicle going back and forth between the farm and the city.<br><br>Dangerous bears appear randomly on the farm, and kill any animal that cross their paths. They have to be quickly contained on cages, and afterwards collected on boxes to be sold as a product.

The storage space at the bottom is limited, and sometimes bears and other products can't be stored on time and disappear after a while.<br><br>The structures surrounding the game field are used to process the raw materials produced by the farm into more refined products, like powdered eggs, cheese, baked goods and other items. The stars received after completing a level have to be spent on upgrades to the machines on the shop screen, to make them more efficient and unlock new levels. There is no time limit to complete each stage, but finishing within a specific time frame, shown at the top, gives awards and bonus stars.

The goal is of course to get the ball into the hole with the flag in as less strikes as possible. To make it harder for the players to meet that goal, the courses are littered with obstacles like hills and sand bunkers. In addition the wind decides too where the player's ball lands.<br><br>As opposed to real life though, the player can influence the ball's flightpath during the flight by choosing in which direction it spins. This allows to compensate for wind and also for a bad angle at the strike. How hard the player hits the ball is decided by a gauge where the player needs to click at the right moment. The same goes for the angle. Although the game hands the player a club that it thinks fits the situation, he can also choose his own.

Description=Little Shop: World Traveler is the sixth entry in the hidden object series by GameHouse. As the main protagonist, the player has to go on trips around the globe to find and acquire assorted items for several clients. The main interface is very similar to the one in the previous titles: a static scene showing the location is presented with several objects discreetly placed over certain parts of the scenery. The objective is to search and click on all the items listed at the bottom of the screen, with a minimum of ten objects to complete the level, and a maximum of fifteen to receive a gold star.<br><br>Besides the required list entries, each scene has special power-ups that are activated when clicked. Cameras of any type make the screen all bright with their flash lamps, making the list objects stand out from the white background for a few seconds. Thermometers create a layer of icicles or a wall of fire on each visible list entry, becoming hotter or colder when the cursor is near or far from them. ? marks give extra hints, while ! points activate a power-up related to the location. In the forest, this specific power is a compass whose needle spins faster when near one of the list objects. A trophy is received after collecting all suitcases and passport stampers.<br><br>The Shake-It mini-game at the end of each trip is a new addition to the formula, where a box filled with several small items is shown from a top view, and the player has to drag and shake it to uncover some key objects. In some rounds, the goal is to find several instances of the same object. In others, the objective is to find items like dices and cards that add up to a specified sum. All the locations completed in the main mode can be replayed in the Blitz Mode, where the objective is to find all the objects from a scene as fast as possible, to achieve a high score.

Description=Ai-kun is a cute pink cupid (who calls himself "[your] little love friend") who needs your help - he needs to catch the hearts falling down from the sky in order to make you and your lover retain your relationship, and he can't do it alone! You need to help him shoot the hearts by writing their numbers before they crash down on the ground, heartbroken (literally!)!<br><br>Gameplay consists of helping Ai-kun by writing the numbers of the colored hearts that slowly drift down from the top of the screen to shoot at them. Shooting multiple hearts with the same color rewards you with "hit bonuses" at the end of each level. The objective is to fill the Love Barometer all the way up to clear each stage. Missing hearts and letting them fall to the bottom will reduce your score and the Love Barometer. There are also different kinds of colored numerical hearts, such as hearts you must touch to reveal the number, hearts that change color when tapped, hearts that constantly change color and will only focus on a specific color when tapped or a heart with wings you must quickly shoot at to activate the temporary powerup "Love Barrier". You can also collect golden coins, and when you have 50 coins in possession, the "LoveMachine" slot machine will appear and automatically start to play. The LoveMachine will randomly stop the reels on it's own, and will reward you with bonus points if it gets three of the same reel in a row, and will continue playing for 25 coins per reel spin.<br><br>On occasion, a gift box will show up. Touching the box will trigger either one of three things, a math quiz, "Wheel of Luck" or the appearance of Ai-kun's "little friend" (a devil) on the playfield. The math quiz requires you to quickly answer one or more easy math problems under a short amount of time so you can "win a gift for your lover" - answer well and you are rewarded with the "gift" which will give you bonus points. The "Wheel of Luck" is an event where a wheel (with eight segments, half of them being a picture of Ai-kun, and the other half a picture of a dark blue cloud with a face (Thunder)) will automatically appear and spin itself. If the arrow lands on Ai-kun, the player will be rewarded with "Super Shot", in which Ai-kun will clone himself into three and will automatically shoot every heart on screen for temporary amount of time - if it lands on Thunder, the player will be punished via the "Thunder" penalty, in which Thunder will appear from the top of the screen and blow a gust of wind which will push all of the hearts down to the bottom of the screen, thus reducing the player's score and Love Barometer. Ai-kun's "little friend" can appear from the box, in which he will break the hearts slowly drifting down on the screen. To defeat him, you have to wait for a number to appear on him just before he breaks another heart, and then quickly write said number down to shoot at him.<br><br>After clearing a stage and before moving on to the next, you will enter a bonus round to earn some more points, in which the bonus round would be either a color matching game, or collecting the hearts falling through pinball/pachinko-like pins from Ai-kun's "little friend" into Ai-kun's basket.<br><br>There are 40 levels in all to complete. There's also an optional two player mode called "Love Test", where two players (or "lovers") will take turns in order to calculate the two players' love for each other. Online global highscore leaderboards are also available.

Description=Magnetic Sports Soccer is a mobile recreation of table football games, although it differs in a number of ways from a traditional table game. First of all there is no bars in this game. Instead each figure is attached to a spring and is controlled individually. The figures are also magnetic and attracts the ball. Each team in the game consists of six player figures (plus goalkeeper) in a  2-1-2-1 formation. The player uses the touch screen to pull the ball holding figure back to set the force and direction before releasing for a shot. The precision of the shot depends on the strength. Once the ball is lost to the opposing team the player gets to position his goalkeeper, although once the ball is in motion the keeper will try to get the ball himself. Additionally, it's possible to tilt the table. The tilt is charging while the opposition has the ball and once it is full it can be triggered by shaking the device or pressing a button. <br><br>The game features these three modes: <br><br>1. Quick Match<br><br> Magnetic World Cup<br><br> Challenge<br><br>Quick match is a single customisable match where the player can choose both goal and time limits, the difficulty of the game and three different arenas.The magnetic world cup is a recreation of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa where the player can pick any of the 32 countries.

Description=Pac-Man: Championship edition is a sequel, by the same developer Toru Iwatani, done in the style of the original classic. As before, you are Pac-Man and you are in a maze with dots, power pellets and hosts.  The object is to eat the dots and avoid the ghosts, unless you eat a power pellet, which gives you the ability to eat the ghosts for a few seconds.<br><br>What's new here is many different mazes and modes.  This is designed from the ground up as a console game, so some arcade traditions are lost.  The object is no longer to try to survive/get a high score without losing quarters, but to get a high score in a set time limit.  You do still have a set number of lives, which makes your time end early if you lose all them.<br><br>Unlike the original or its prodigy, Championship Edition isn't broken into distinct levels.  Once you clear one side of the maze, a fruit appears on the other side.  Eating the fruit regenerates the empty half with new walls, dots, power pellets, etc and increases the game speed.<br><br>The iPhone version of the game adds two additional modes.  In "Mission Mode", you must clear a specific goal set by the game at the beginning of play (such as eating two apples, or eating eight ghosts consecutively).  In "Challenge Mode", you must aim to achieve the top score for each course, but this time the ghosts have been sped up so that they are initially much faster.<br><br>The look is a bright neon which evokes the classic Pac-Man but takes advantage of nearly 30 years of increased computer power.

It's played from a third person perspective and is fully rendered in 3D with the developer's own Fuse engine. Two control methods are available. The player can either use the touch screen by dragging his finger right or left or the gyro sensor by tilting the phone. Acceleration and braking is done by dragging the finger up and down on the screen. When using the touch screen to steer it is possible to enable auto acceleration. The cars also has boosting and tackling functionality. To boost the player needs to pick up lighting bolt collectibles that are scattered around the tracks and this gives some extra power briefly. In addition to the lighting bolts there is also laughing skulls which the player has to avoid since they will drain the player's boost. When no boost is left the car slows to a crawl for a few seconds.  Tackling can be done whenever the player is close to a competitor who is then sent spinning. <br><br>The game features three game modes: arcade, time attack and championship. In the arcade mode the player gets to race through all the levels and has to reach checkpoints before the time expires. In the time attack mode the player gets to compete for the fastest time on any track that is unlocked.

The aim of the game is to create a line of three or more smilies of the same colour. This is done by rotating a group of three adjecent smilies. Once a match is made the smilies are removed from the board and others fall down and take their place. In addition to the smilies there are also rocks that are unmovable. These can't be swapped and are removed when they reach the bottom of the board. The player can shake the phone to instantly destroy all the rocks as well as number of random smilies. <br><br>Three game modes are available: skilled, time attack and freestyle. Skilled and time attack modes use a progress bar as level systems. At the start of a level it is half filled up and decreases with time in the time attack mode and for every swap in the skilled mode. The bar increases as the player scores points and once it's full the player levels up. Points are earned for each smiley and rock that is removed. For bonus points the player can create combos (removing smilies of several colours at once) and chain (removing smilies in cascade) events. In the freestyle mode there is no progress bar and player can play at his own pace.<br><br>The game uses the Scoreloop service for online high score lists.

Description=Solipskier is a fast-paced action game based around skiing. The aim of the game is to get the skier as far as possible without crashing and rack up a large amount of points, but the player does not control him directly. Instead you need to draw the snow for him to ski on, with the mouse (Browser) of by touching the screen (iPhone). Downslopes allow him to speed up, but he will climb up hills as well. By drawing downslopes ending in an upwards curve, he can be launched in the air. Doing that in quick succession allows him to travel great distances at large speeds. While in the air tricks are performed automatically when the player stops painting snow. The game builds up a score while playing, and by catching air, stars are earned and multipliers are built up. It is also possible to ski through gates and long tunnels to receive additional points and gain speed. Touching red gates kills the skier instantly, however and there are parts that prevent the player from drawing snow to ski on. Indicators on the right announce gates, tunnels and hazards. The skier is designed as a white figure with headphones, blasting rock music. At very high speeds it is possible to lose the headphones, making the rushing wind the only sound.

Description=Cartman and his friends from South Park takes part in a Japanese game show, Mega Millionaire!, with the chance to earn large amounts of money (at least that's what they think before looking up the currency rates). The show which is considered highly dangerous, lets the contestants, wearing roller blades, rush through obstacle courses. The goal of each course is simple: reach the goal, while grabbing as many yen bills as possible. <br><br>The game takes place on a board with each square of the board representing an event. The player moves the boys across the board until and plays through the events one after the other. There is also special squares, which allows the player to spin on the wheel of misfortune. By doing this extra conditions are added to following stage. <br><br>The actual gameplay of the events consists of side scrolling platforming. The controls are simple: the player can move left or right and jump. Due to the roller blades the boys don't stop automatically but has to use the brake button. Each event has different obstacles, like the floor being full of greasy peanut butter, pools of water (and other liquid substances), sumo wrestlers and men in rabbit suits. In addition to the bills, each event also has three yen tokens, which if all collected gives massive bonuses to the player. <br><br>In addition to playing through all the events in the right order in the story mode, there is also an option for quick play where all completed events are available for play at any time. It's also possible to unlock another mode, the Hurry Run mode. This is done by picking up all tokens from all the events. The objective of this mode is simply to reach the goal as quickly as possible. The game's multiplayer mode allows up to four players play on the same phone by taking turns on the game board.

Description=In the year 2142 mankind is working on colonizing Mars. Vast settlements have been created to house miners looking for the big money by salvaging the valuable materials of the planet. Sadly there's not much else to do so crime is at an all time high and the citizens are bored. To that end a new form of entertainment was created: the Speed Forge.<br><br>Very similar to Wipeout, the player chooses one of the available high-speed hovercrafts and hits the futuristic closed racing-circuits in order to get first place against up to five AI-enemies. The player sees his craft from behind and steers/accelerates either by tilting his device or by using the on-screen-display. To spice things up, the hovercrafts are equipped with various weapon slots for which ammunition is scattered around the track. Ranging from machine gun fire over rockets to mines, the player has all the means to destroy his opponents or get destroyed himself. To prevent that from happening, power-ups like shields or repair-kits can also be collected by simply driving over them.<br><br>These drops also become important in the arena-mode where the driver with the most frags wins the match. During the course of the game the player unlocks up to 12 tracks, 6 distinct hovercrafts and additional weapons and power-ups.

Description=Speedx 3D is an action game where the player races through a tunnel at high speeds. The player views the tunnel from a first-person perspective and steers with use of the phone's accelerator. The tunnel is full of blocks and other obstacles that the player has to avoid crashing into. The goal of the game is simply to survive as long as possible. The race doesn't always go through tunnels, at times it transforms to a flat surface and sometimes the player finds himself racing on the outside of the tunnel. <br><br>The player can collect bonuses that he comes across at the track. Each bonus can be used once and it's only possible to have one at a time. They are activated simply by touching the screen (except for the shields which are automatically activated). The bonuses available are shields (orange fields on the track) that can be used to destroy obstacles, quakes (red fields) that destroy all visible obstacles, time dilatation (blue fields) that slows down the game and freezes moving objects, and space folds (green fields) that end hazard zones. Hazards includes blackouts where the tunnel is rendered in negative, gravity wells that limits the visibility and distorts the vision, dark nebulas where the cubes are in negative, hue shifts that are full of different colors, and plasma clouds where the player can collide with a vortex that resets all bonuses.

The action is shown from a top down perspective, and the d-pad is used for controlling the spore.<br><br>Between levels the player will be able to customize his spore with an editor. The further in the game the player gets, the more changes to the spore he can make.

Description=A group of pirates has found the mysterious island known holding the hidden treasures of the lords. It's not just any island however. According to folklore, the island is cursed and full of traps. That each path to the treasures is blocked with impenetrable stone gates doesn't make it easier for the pirates. The pirate captain however won't give up without trying, and orders his crew to set up the big cannon. <br><br>Like in Gamevil's earlier games, Skipping Stone and NOM, the game is controlled with only one button. The idea of the game is to navigate a bomb through a network of baskets. Each level of the game has two cannons, and a number of baskets in between that are used to move the bomb from the cannon at the bottom of the playfield to the one at the top. You have no control over the movement of the baskets, as they move in predefined patterns (both vertically, horizontally and diagonally). Therefore timing is crucial when you launch the bomb from one basket to another. You'll also come across different traps and obstacles, that you have to use to your advantage. Once a level is complete, the stone gate blocking the way will be destroyed and you can go on to the next level, being one step closer to the treasures.<br><br>In addition to the story mode, the game also offers an endless mode, which works the same way except that it picks levels randomly and goes on till the player has lost all his bombs. After that, the player can submit his score to the Gamevil Live leaderboard.

Description=Toss It is a game similar to Throw Paper! and Paper Toss. The concept is simple: hit a waste bin with a ball of crumpled paper. The player uses the touch screen to flick the ball towards the waste bin. The direction of the flick determines where the ball will fly. To make it trickier the player has to take into account the wind which blows at different speeds from either left or right side of the screen. For each hit the player scores a point until he misses. Scores can then be submitted online through the Scoreloop service. The game has a number of different levels and each has different background images, distance to the waste bin and type of wind. One level has a moving waste bin while another has a time limit. <br><br>The player can choose to challenge anyone on the highscore list to beat his score. To play a challenge each player bets a number of coins. After the scores are compared the winner takes half of the stake while the loser loses his stake. If it's a tie, the player who accepted the challenge wins. When the player runs out of coins he can purchase more. This functionality requires a Scoreloop account.

Description=Trivial Pursuit is an adaptation of the board game of the same name. The game can be played in two modes. Classic-mode is an exact duplicate of the original game. The players control a cake-form which can hold six pieces. The board is shaped like a wheel and divided into squares with six of them being so-called category headquarters. The goal of the game is to land on each of those category headquarters and answer the corresponding question correctly which in turn earns the player a corresponding piece to fill up the cake-form. Once he has collected all six pieces, the player has to move back to the center of the board for the final question. If he gets the answer right, he wins the game.<br><br>To get on the category headquarters, the up to four players or bots (virtually) throw a six-sided dice. Every player can roll the dice as many times as he manages to answer the question corresponding to the category of the square he lands on after moving his cake-form. The same system is used in Pursuit-mode but instead of collecting six pieces to win, the sole goal is to get from one end of the custom-made board to the other.

The events can be played on their own or all in a row in the Olympic Games mode. By winning the Olympic Games mode on hard difficulty, a survival mode is unlocked.
