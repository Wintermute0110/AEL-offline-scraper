You're a little black cat who wants to make love to a pretty lady cat that lives in an apartment complex. Play all kinds of cat-themed mini games in order to reach her and score as many points as you can while doing so.<br><br>You start out in an alley and need to get inside the apartment by climbing on garbage cans and a fence. Next, jump on a clothesline and through several open windows while big dogs try to eat you and people throw garbage at you. Outside of the apartment complex you can score points by eating the mice that run across the clotheslines. Once you've jumped through a window you enter a room where you play a randomly assigned mini game.<br><br>These mini games include: eating all the fish in a fish bowl, stealing milk from a bunch of bulldogs, pushing a birdcage from a table and eating the bird, catching mice inside a big cheese, pushing vases from a cabinet. To make things harder there's always a broom inside every room that tries to knock you around. You score points by completing the mini games within a certain time (the faster the better).<br><br>After you've completed a mini game you're back in the alley. Make your way back inside the apartment complex and you get a chance to play the love-cat game: try to reach the lady cat on the top row of hearts while rival male cats and cupid's arrows knock you down.

Description=Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares or by removing all opposing pieces from the board. <br><br>However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat (just like in Star Control, also by Paul Reiche III). If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.<br><br>Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.<br><br>The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.<br><br>Archon can be played with either one or two players.<br>The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.

Description=Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.

Description=The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.<br><br>The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.<br><br>By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.

It also throws daggers from time to time as it advances. The third wave pits you against the deadly med flies, which dance in a line around the screen. If you don't shoot them fast enough, they start to break off from the group, dancing wildly and raining daggers down upon you. Finish this last wave and you get bonus points for the amount of fuel you have left and get treated to a small interlude where a chorus of bugs sings to you as a med fly pollinates a flower.<br><br>The second and third levels are similar to the first, except that they are tougher.

But one nameless hero, the protagonist of this game, has to stand up against the evil.

It is less event-oriented than Japanese games and focuses on exploration. The gameplay is somewhat similar to  Pandora's  RPG of the same name, even though the two games are unrelated. Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in  Bard's Tale games. Enemy encounters, however, are handled more similarly to those of  Ultima: the enemies appear on the exploration screen, and the battle initiates only if the player character approaches the enemy. The battles take place on a top-down field; the heroes and the enemies move around, but the player can't navigate the characters manually: it is only possible to issue commands such as &quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Use Magic&quot;, etc. The game has a day/night cycle. Party members (up to three, excluding the hero) have to be sought out in various cities, rather then joining the hero for plot-related reasons.

Description=Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

Just as the original game, there are three weapon types, each of them upgradable, as well as screen-clearing bombs (which look like flashing skulls), and multiple stages each with a boss at the end. The game also features a bizarre running commentary on the side of the screen by a square-headed face.

You've been chased up into a palm tree and are hanging on a rope, but the apes aren't going to leave you be, so you're going to have to defend yourself!<br><br>Donkey Gorilla is a basic action game where the player controls the stranded character hanging from a rope tied between palm trees. On the ground are a number of primates, and they must be eliminated before they can climb the tree and cut the rope. There is also a bat that flies overhead, attacking from above, but will sometimes fly low enough to be shot. Only a direct hit to the head will kill an ape, and if the player is killed either by the apes or the bat above, all apes on that stage will return. If the player can eliminate all the apes, then play continues on the next stage with a different formation of apes.

Description=D.P.S. is a collection of three short scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played separately. Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional console named Dream Program System. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature nudity and/or sexual situations.<br><br>The scenarios in this game include:<br><br>1.  A medieval fantasy tale entitled Princess Fantasy, in which the player controls a knight who accompanies a princess on a journey. Depending on the personality choice, the knight can either be brave and compassionate, or cynically take advantage of the helpless girl.<br><br>2.  A typical "naughty doctor" story, in which the player - as either male or female school doctor - has to "examine" young and pretty female patients, trying not to scare them away by employing too direct methods.<br><br>3.  An encounter between a famous female pop idol and her fan (also female), which leads to a bizarre sexual experience. The player can choose to control the events from the point of view of either the star or the fan.<br><br>The gameplay is essentially that of a visual novel. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are "neutral", having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered "bad" by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of character in the beginning of a scenario.

Selios married his sweetheart Dina, and they had a child, whom they gave the name Atlas. At the age of fifteen, Atlas was already a strong warrior, thanks to the lessons of his teacher Lowel. Everything seemed peaceful in the country, until two warriors spotted strange creatures near the capital city. Those were... men in space suits! Of course, the warriors could not have known this and believed them to be monsters. Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?<br><br>The second "Dragon Slayer" is very similar to the first game, graphically and gameplay-wise. The only major difference is the fact that the enemies are now completely visible on screen before battles, so that the player can avoid fighting them if he wants to.

Each of your team members has an "EL" rating which indicates how close he is to dying. Death comes quickly for new team members, but as your team gains experience by mapping more and more of the Amazon and Incan ruins, your EL rating goes up and your team members become quite a bit more effective at avoiding hazards. You also get an Efficiency Rating "ER" which is an overall score of your exploration completed and loot collected minus your money spent and the number of team members killed.<br><br>Once you have mapped a few sectors of jungle you will find some ruins with passages leading underground. Underground is a lot more hazardous than the jungle, as many of the pitfalls you encounter mean instant death if you don't have the proper equipment or your team was not alert. The natives are also a lot more numerous underground as well.  But don't worry, you can always replace members of your expedition. Besides, what does it matter if you lost your Field Assistant if the rest of your team is carrying out a bagful of gold and silver?

Description=The first, obscure instalment in the Herzog series is also one of the early precursors of the modern-day RTS (real-time strategy game) genre that was popularised by Dune 2. Unlike the common RTS game, the playfield is a long vertical stretch instead of the well-known map stretching in both X and Y axes. <br><br>Another now unique trait is that there is little emphasis on building up a base to produce units which are then directly commanded into action. Instead, a base is already located at each end of the path, and the player is given control over a hovering battlemech. New units are bought using funds accumulated during play. These units, ranging from single foot soldiers to tanks and AA batteries, advance from the home base towards the enemy base. The player may pick up a single unit (or five soldiers) and move them closer to the enemy base in order to speed up the attack. A radar on the top of the screen gives an overlook of the battlefield.<br><br>The opposing faction has got the same resources, and the enemy battlemech will make raids towards your base, forcing you into mech-on-mech battle. This element turns Herzog into a rather unique blend of strategy and shoot'em up.<br><br>The game takes place in a balkanised region, where the last war has given birth to a new state, called Ruth. A military coup d'état in the now-independent state leads to a new war, which the peace-loving Mercies must win.

In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.<br><br>This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known  Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other  historical simulation games by  the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.

Description=M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.<br><br>You start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.<br><br>Each turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.<br><br>After the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.<br><br>After the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.<br><br>Third phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. <br><br>There are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:<br>- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.<br>- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.<br>- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).<br>- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.<br>- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.<br>- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.<br>- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.<br>- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.<br><br>M.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. <br><br>M.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.

Description=In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. <br><br>Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.<br><br>During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

Description=Punch Ball Mario Bros. is a single-screen action game adapted from the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros.. Visually and structurally, the game is quite similar: enemies emerge from pipes at the top of the screen, and must be knocked over and kicked off the stage. Enemies that reach the bottom will enter a pipe and return to the top. The last remaining enemy on the stage, as well as any enemy left knocked over for too long, will change color and move faster. However, unlike the original game where Mario must flip enemies by hitting the platform they're on from underneath, in Punch Ball, Mario (and optionally a second player as Luigi) carries a red ball which can be thrown at enemies to knock them over. The ball must be picked back up after being thrown.<br><br>Every few stages, there is a bonus coin round with no enemies. Most stages also feature a POW block in the center, which can be hit a limited number of times to flip every enemy on the screen. There is also a small pit in the center of the screen at the bottom, into which Mario can fall if he isn't careful. One or two players can play the game simultaneously.

The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.<br><br>The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between  Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.<br><br>The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.

Description=Super Mario Bros. Special is, on the surface, a port of the original classic. However, while it may look similar, this is a completely redesigned game that plays very differently from its NES brother. The most significant difference is that it features none of the original levels; the eight worlds featured are all unique to this release, and have a high level of difficult surpassing even Super Mario Bros. 2. Also unlike the original game, the screen does not scroll. Rather, when Mario reaches the end of the screen, he emerges on the left side of the next screen.<br><br>The game features a number of enemies and power-ups not found in the original game. Many of the enemies from Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. return, and powerups include the hammer from Donkey Kong, as well as a time bonus item and a wing that lets Mario swim through the air. The game, however, does not include Mario's twin brother Luigi nor any two-player option.

Using her considerable powers, Minax travels through time and space to the hero's homeworld of Earth and instigates a nuclear war, thus serving the dual purpose of working out her frustration as well as erasing the hero from history. Of course, as the hero, this works out rather badly for you, and so with the help of Lord British you must travel through time and somehow find Minax and prevent the events which culminate in the destruction of Earth.

Description=The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the story and goal. <br><br>Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.<br><br>This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre. <br><br>Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to complete your transformation into Avatarhood.

To protect Duma, the heart of the land, the knight Tristram fought valiantly, but was heavily wounded in battle. Mel, a young female magician from Asrafil, has tended to his wounds, and after three months Tristram is healthy again, ready to enter a decisive battle against the forces of Seljild.<br><br>Vain Dream is a RPG with traditionally Japanese emphasis on story and characters, as well as simple game mechanics and mostly linear progression. However, combat is handled differently in this game than in most other Japanese RPGs, and similarly to  Emerald Dragon (made by the same company); still turn-based, it allows free movement on the battle field, calculating the amount of turns without displaying them, thus creating an illusion of real-time battles. Enemies usually appear in groups and are visibly walking on screen in hostile locations.

Instead of playing as a party of six player generated chracters, in Wizardry IV you filled the shoes of Werdna, the evil Archmage who you fought at the end of the original Wizardry.<br><br>It seems that after he was defeated by the party of adventurers who stole his amulet, Werdna was imprisoned at the bottom of his 10 level labyrinth in an eternal slumber to be tortured by nightmares for eternity. Although Werdna was supposed to sleep forever, somehow he has awakened, and now he's out for revenge.<br><br>At the beginning of the game Werdna finds himself in a situation that is singularly unique for most arch-villains: he is stripped of his powers, trapped within his own former stronghold, and filled with the realization that the same traps and monsters he created to keep adventurers out now act as obstacles to his freedom.<br><br>As Werdna, you'll slowly regain your magical powers as well as have the ability to summon helpful monsters to accompany you on your journey. Your goal is to get to the surface and get your amulet (and hopefully a little revenge). But in your way are a variety of monsters, guardians, and gung-ho adventurers out for your head. Not to mention being chased by the rather ticked-off ghost of your old enemy Trebor. Make it to the surface, and you'll have to face one final grudge match against the heroes who defeated you in the past before you can get your amulet.<br><br>Wizardry IV features a somewhat tweaked version of the same engine and graphics that was used in the previous 3 Wizardry (and used one final time in Wizardry V). Unlike every other game in the entire series, you cannot import characters from the previous game (for obvious reasons). The game features three different endings: a good ending, an evil ending, and a special Grandmaster ending which is often considered to be the single most difficult task to achieve in the entire series.

Unfortunately this particular honor didn't last very long as Trebor's madness and obsession with the amulet and preventing Werdna's return drove him to suicide.<br><br>With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of Llylgamyn.

Unfortunately the god Gnilda, more than a bit ticked off with all this bickering, took the staff back and placed it deep within his heavily guarded six-level temple.

Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth is in fact his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard (and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process).

Description=The second game in Nihon Falcom's Dragon Slayer series is, like its predecessor, a dungeon-crawling RPG with action combat. You are a nameless apprentice fighter who must venture into the depths of a cave system beneath the town and become stronger by fighting the creatures that lurk there. When you come into contact with an enemy, you enter a separate battle screen with multiple enemies. You attack enemies by simply bumping into them. You'll take damage if the enemy attempts to attack you from the sides or from behind, but if you are stronger than the enemy, you'll damage it by frontal attack. Killing enemies gives you experience points and treasure. In the town, you can train separately either one of your main parameters (strength, dexterity, charisma, etc.), spending your experience the way you like.

Description=This is an expansion to  Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II. Just like the original game, it is not particularly story-driven; once again, the player is thrown into the medieval fantasy world as a lone nameless hero, who must explore the maze-like environments and stay alive in the process. <br><br>This add-on scenario features new, more complex maps, new enemies (including bosses), and a trading system which allows purchasing items in one shop and selling them for profit in another. Otherwise, the gameplay system remains identical to that of the predecessor; with side-scrolling exploration, separate top-down battle screens, "bumping" action-based combat, and role-playing system with levelling up, equipment, etc.<br><br>The game requires the original Xanadu to play; character creation must be done with the original game discs inserted, after which the player can directly access this scenario.

Description=It is the 12th century, and the muslim world has been split into two warring factions. Meanwhile, Muhammed's disciples are also threatened external forces – in the west the crusaders; in the east the Mongols. As the Persian assassin Sadler, you are given the task of murdering the kalif, hopefully saving the future of the islamic faith in the process, a process which will have implications ranging as far as 800 years into the future. First, however, you must find your three assassin friends and complete a range of quests, for this is an RPG.<br><br>Like many of Falcom's games, XZR (or Exile, as it is pronounced) is played in a traditional top-down view when in villages and towns, and shifts to a side-scrolling platform view when entering dungeons, castles and other action sequences. Apart from equipping your character with an arsenal of weapons and clothes in order to raise hit points and attack points, you can also quaff potions to boost your points. Mind you, these are not ordinary magical potions, but heavy drugs such as hashish, cocain, LSD and heroin. The effect of the drugs only lasts a short while, and too liberal usage of the narcotics will corrupt the screen, or even kill you.<br><br>Even though your party is made up of as many as four characters, only Sadler can be controlled; others do as they want and must be retrieved once they wander off to finish their specialised tasks. All battles are fought alone, since it would be impossible to control several characters in the real-time platform sequences. Though magic can be used, it is seldom as strong or useful as hand-to-hand combat.

Description=This is the second game in the long-running Ys action RPG series. A bright light shot up from Dahm Tower in the end of the first game, and our hero Adol Christian is awakened by a young girl who finds him lying on the ground. She introduces herself as Lilia and tells Adol he is in the land of Ys. Finally he was able to establish a connection between his world and this mysterious land! But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop the evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is...<br><br>This game is a direct sequel to what PC players know as  Ancient Land of Ys (of which the original NES version was simply called Ys), and is also the same game (story-wise) as the second part of Ys: Book I & II for TurboGrafx CD. The gameplay utilizes an unusual action RPG combat style, where you don't press any attack button, but run into your enemies in order to cause damage. You should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise you'll be dead. You can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade your weapons and inventory, like in any other RPG.

Not new to the series is the use of magical rings which give Adol different powering up abilities such as healing and shielding.  The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.

Description=Zan: Yasha Enbukyoku is a turn-based strategy game set in feudal Japan.<br><br>The background for the game's events is the ongoing battle between noble warriors, known as yasha, and demons. Between the two stand the "middle people", i.e. other Japanese generals and rulers. The player can choose to play as either yasha, demonic, or "middle" army. <br><br>The player has to manage his army, deploying units for protection and attack, as well as negotiating with other rulers. Events such as earthquakes, plagues, etc. occur randomly. Diplomacy doesn't always work, so battles against enemy armies occupy a large portion of the game. The battles are somewhat similar to those of turn-based RPGs (though the game has no RPG elements): the player chooses commands from a menu, such as attack, use magic, use special technique, use a battle formation, etc. There is no active movement during the battles. The outcome of the battle depends on the chosen commands as well as on the strength of the units.

Description=Described by its developers as a "New Type Role-Playing Game", Zavas differs from the Japanese-made RPGs by resembling a Western-style RPG, in particular the  Ultima games of its time. Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana (with slight Middle Eastern influences), and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns.  Similarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party (NPCs with names and portraits, but little personality can be found and recruited). beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices (for example, paying money or attacking a guard who demands toll to enter a city). The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.
