Description=1000 Words is a word puzzle game set in ancient Greece. A young apprentice of Xerxes gets the opportunity to leave the peasant life and take a stab at gold and glory by challenging mythical figures and gods. The gameplay is based on anagrams. Games start with a mix of six letters used to construct words of different length. Letters are selected by moving an arrow-shaped cursor. When a word is formed, points are awarded, a meter fills up, and new letters appear on the tablet.<br><br>Next to the story mode, the three game modes can also be played in the Quickplay mode:<br><br>1. Classical: find as many words of different length as you can before time elapses.<br>2. 6-Letter Challenge: find the 6 letter word in a given number of tries.<br>3. Evolution: find words of specific length before time runs out.<br><br>While playing, players can earn bonuses that provide additional time or freeze it, guess a word for the player, or shuffle the letters. The player can also receive penalties from his opponent. These empty the bonus gauge, mirror the letters or even hide them. Bonuses become available by discovering the six-letter word multiple times, and penalties arrive when it takes too long to form a word.<br><br>There is a high score screen for each mode and a tutorial explaining the basics. The game offers sound effects and music, along with an overview map in the quest mode, and pre-game screens where the opponents offer some pearls of wisdom.

Description=Bejeweled Twist is a tile matching game, where the player rotates groups of four jewels to create rows and columns of three or more matching gems.

The coal can't be matched, but it can be exploded by one of the power-ups gems. The locked jewel is chained to its place and can't move, but it can be removed with a match. Bomb gems display the number of moves allowed before they explode, destroying the board and ending the game. They have to be matched before their counters reach zero, otherwise a revolving wheel-of-fortune appears that stops in one of two values, skulls or gems, that either detonate or disarm the bomb. This mini-game becomes more difficult every time it comes up.<br><br>The power-ups appear after making matches of four or more gems. A four jewel match creates the flame gem, that explodes when matched removing all surrounding jewels. A five jewel match creates the lightning gem, that destroys a column and a row at the same time in a cross of fire.<br><br>With the exception of Classic Mode , the other modes are unlocked with continuous playing. Zen Mode is similar to Classic, but is more relaxed without the bomb and locked jewels. Challenge Mode is a puzzle mode, where the objective is to perform a task, like removing all gems of one color, or making a number of matches in a row. In Blitz Mode, the goal is to accumulate the maximum amount of points possible within a time limit.

Description=Bode Miller Alpine Racing brings an Olympic-style skiing competition to your mobile phone. From the main menu, you choose the number of players (single player or two player hot seat), competition type (downhill, super G, and slalom), course, and skis (each one has a different effect on your maneuverability, speed, and tucking). The game itself begins at the gate with a zoomed-in interface where you’ll need to time 3 beeps/flashes to build up power. Each press builds up a percentage -- if you nail all three lights you’ll get 100% power at launch. The game display then switches to an overhead camera focused on your skier, where you use three keypad controls: Left and Right for turning, and OK to tight tuck or recover when off balance. Increasing your turn angle allows you to make tighter turns but at the potential cost of speed.<br><br>In Slalom mode, left/right motions are much faster and more sensitive. At the cost of maneuverability, a tight tuck increases your speed and prevents you from slowing down when hitting jumps, but your speed bonus is greater at turns than when you are going straight down the mountain. The energy meter in the top right corner of the screen recharges faster when you are not tucked. In Easy mode you receive time penalties for errors while in Hard mode, errors puts you out of the competition. If you hit the side areas or any obstacles you crash. Crashing ends your race in utter humiliation with some harsh words from Bode himself. At the end of the race the tight tuck button can be double tapped to execute a “reach” for the finish line, which will shave off a small amount of time. “Reaching” takes energy so you’ll want to conserve your energy, and time the maneuver appropriately.<br><br>The key to winning the race is through effective turning, quick timing of turns and tucks, and strategic use of energy. Scores can be uploaded after the medal ceremony for an event if you win the Gold Medal. Your scores are entered into an online database that tracks the top scores and skiers. The game also allows you to send the real Bode Miller a text message letting him know that you are rooting for him and be eligible to win one of hundreds of prizes.

Description=Chuzzle Deluxe is a tile matching puzzle game with 4 different game modes and trophies for special events.<br><br>Basically, you have a 6x6 rows big screen, filled with different colored Chuzzles (some sort of pets). Unlike other tile matching games, you don't move the tile (in this case the Chuzzle), but you actually move the entire row so that you get 3 same colored Chuzzles in a group. They then "explode" and the gap is filled with new Chuzzles. Row moving is possible due to the fact that the rows (both horizontal and vertical) are "round", meaning that moving the outer left Chuzzle one tile to the left will result in appearing of it at the outer right position.<br><br>The four different game modes are: Classic, Speed, Zen and Mind Bender.<br><br>Classic works like explained above, but you will also face mega Chuzzles (2x2 tiles big) which can't move out of the screen and locks, which will lock the two rows where it is located. Locks can be destroyed by making a match (mega Chuzzles by the way too). The game mode is level based. Just score as much points as needed for the level and you proceed with the next one. If you run out of possible matches, you can scramble the screen (basically this equals the lost of a life).<br><br>Speed is like Classic, but you play against the clock. With each match, the counter is set a bit back, but as soon as the counter reaches the top, one Chuzzle will be locked. This goes until no moves are possible. Once you completed the level, the locks are reset.<br><br>Zen is a relaxing mode. No locks and no clock.<br><br>In Mind Bender, you job is to recreate a certain given pattern with your 36 Chuzzles. No clock and no special level order required to play.<br><br>For the first three game modes, if you don't know any further, you can buy a hint (reduction of the score).<br><br>The major feature of the game are the trophies. In the Trophy Room, you see 22 placeholders for trophies, which will be awarded as soon as you met the requirements. Those are for example for seven-step cascades (you make one match, which will trigger six additional matches), beating 10 levels of Classic, making a six tiles long match, or playing a game without using a hint and much much more.

Take up the role of a reporter, and figure out whodunnit before your editor, Braunmann, sends the story to presses in Clue.<br><br>Clue is a game inspired by the board game of the same name.  Rather than being identical to the original game, the goal in this version of the game is to work out where the crime took place, who committed the crime, and what was used by interrogating those at the crime scene and examining suspicious places in each room.  You'll be given useful information which will reveal the locations of most (if not all) characters and weapons, as well as find out the cause of Black's demise.<br><br>You'll be racing against the clock with each case - you've got to make your deadline.  Talking to a character knocks 2 minutes from the clock, searching an object takes 4 minutes per object, and traveling to another location takes 1 minute per room you travel through.  You've got to be careful not to waste time!<br><br>At any time, you can check your Crime Map to move elsewhere in the house, look at your notes (these keep track of important clues that you've discovered for reference), and view your Suspicions to mark off any characters, objects or rooms that have been cleared.

Most races are against AI-controlled players, but there are also time trials. Each race takes place in a different city with a typical environment, and sometimes you also race at night.

If there is an even larger creature above those two creatures, the larger creature will swallow them up immediately, resulting in something called a food chain, which gives the player more points. When a smaller creature hits another, larger, creature, the larger one swallows. After two creatures, the larger ones will eventually explode. If you make one creature eat another and give the larger one to an even larger one, the larger one will explode. <br><br>Biggs also has a son, Smalls. He must provide for his son by barfing. In cooperative mode, the second player plays as Smalls. The speed of coming creatures increases by stage, and if the creatures reach the bottom, where Biggs and Smalls are staged, it'll be a game-over. In single-player mode, filling up the hunger meter will clear a stage. <br><br>In the first stages, creatures range from normal sizes and types: small, medium, and large. Later on, they start to range from things like bombs, which explode on combo-impact. As stages vary, background environments change as well--from lush forest environments to dark caves. <br><br>Multiplayer modes, which include cooperative and competitive, are endless, and adventures and puzzles have an ending. The goal is to finish up the creatures or beat a high score before the creatures reach the bottom of the screen, resulting in a game-over.

Controlling a single blob through a top-down perspective, players need to travel through four distinct city areas (residential, commercial, industrial and government) to bring back colour and happiness to the white Chroma City, whose inhabitants are now forced into dull routines.<br><br>The blob can move very fast in any direction and by crushing leech bots it absorbs a colour. Primary colours can then be mixed to create new ones (e.g. yellow and then red to have orange). Colour is brought back to the buildings by bumping into them. Ink police officers and vans can be attacked in the meantime. When touched by them, the blob turns black and needs to wash it off. Starting small, absorbing colours also make the blob larger, granting access to new areas or preventing from passing through narrow alleys. A bath will reduce the size.<br><br>Each area consists of different blocks where the blob has a limited amount of time to get a set score, based on applying colours to the buildings. Time can be extended by doing missions for characters, such as racing or painting specific landmark buildings. Based on the performance and style (such as colour harmony or time), different stars are awarded and a revolution meter keeps track of the general progress. Extra points are also awarded when the four letters that spell out "BLOB" are found in an area. After reaching the requested score, the level can be exited.<br><br>Next to the Revolution game mode, there is also Free Splash with only points as an objective.

Description=Hironobu Sakaguchi's Final Fantasy... the first of one of the longest role-playing game series known to mankind. Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.<br><br>The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...<br><br>Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. <br><br>In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. <br><br>Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.

A trophy is received after collecting all suitcases and passport stampers.<br><br>The Shake-It mini-game at the end of each trip is a new addition to the formula, where a box filled with several small items is shown from a top view, and the player has to drag and shake it to uncover some key objects.

Description=The mobile version based on the second The Lord of the Rings film turns the action into a top-down, turn-based RPG. You control Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Theoden in battles that take you from the Plains of Rohan to the siege of Helm's Deep. To advance, you need to kill all opponents in battles and ensure that at least one party member stays alive.<br><br>Each turns consists of two phases. In the first phase, you move a character. The possibilities are shown through a green grid. You need to use the terrain to your advantage, as rocks can hinder opponents, certain characters have a longer movement range, and certain areas boost your statistics (e.g. standing on stones instead of mud). Movement is also used tactically to lure opponents with your archer to finish them off with your melee characters.<br><br>In the second phase, you can make your character attack, use a skill or an item, view the entire map, look at the statistics, or open a chest. When attacking, a screen shows what your opponent looks like and the amount of damage dealt. After a battle, you gain experience used to level up. In certain occasions, you or opponents can also dodge attacks. Your team, sometimes split up in smaller groups for certain battles, starts with a limited amount of items, but by defeating enemies and opening chests scattered around, you can collect potatoes, carrots, elixirs and magical items to boost your stats or heal.<br><br>Next to unique weapons and characteristics, each character has a special skill. This is either a different weapon (e.g. knives for Legolas instead of a bow, a skill you can activate at each turn) or a huge aggressive boost, such as Gimli's rage, only available once per battle. The characters' stats are based on strength, dexterity, defense and speed. In certain battles you need to fight tough bosses, or keep reinforcements into account. The opponents move and attack using the same turn-based principles and they can use items as well.

Description=In the future city of Monsteropolis, the use of robot labour has helped civilization grow more than ever before. At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.<br><br>Mega Man is a side-scrolling platformer. Mega Man has the ability to jump and fire his weapon. He must travel to the levels of the six robot masters and defeat them in combat. By doing so, Mega Man is able to acquire their power for his own. These powers can then be used interchangeably with his main weapon and target the weaknesses of specific enemy bosses. Additionally, some hidden areas of the levels can only be accessed by using certain captured robot weapons. A special  Magnet Beam ability can also be found which can be used to create steps. <br><br>Travelling throughout these levels, Mega Man is confronted by an army of lesser robot creations. Destroying these usually yields energy capsules (for refilling Mega Man's Energy), weapon capsules (for refilling Mega Man's special robot weapons), and extra lives shaped like Mega Man's head.

In quick play mode, you are matched up for each game with five other people with similar overall performance. The second mode is league mode. League mode allows you to join a league with five other people and compete with this fixed group of people in different games across league seasons. A league season consists of five games, over a two-and-a-half-week period. You may either join a public league, which matches you up with strangers, or you may join a private league with your friends. <br><br>In either mode, for each game, you are presented with five predictive multiple-choice questions based on real-life upcoming sporting events, from the winner, to game stats, to the performance of a particular player. The five questions you are presented with are based on preferences that you can customize regarding your favorite sports as well as keywords you can enter. This means that you don't have to answer the same questions as other people in your game, but rather questions tailored to your preferences. However, the scoring mechanism is the same for all players and questions, regardless of which were answered.<br><br>After you read each question and make your choices, your answers are submitted to the server. Your choices must be submitted by the game's deadline to ensure everyone has submitted before the events in question start. When playing in league mode, if you miss a game in your league season, answers are auto-picked for you so you don't miss out entirely, but points will be awarded at decreased values for right answers. As the events you predicted resolve, you can check your game progress to see which questions you got right and wrong and how many points you have in the game so far. The later questions to resolve are worth more points, so there is always a chance to come back and win at the end. <br><br>Once every question in the game has resolved, the final scores are tallied and you can view the results. You may win awards or trophies based on your performance and your reputation grows as you earn points over your career. Your reputation, stats, and awards are visible on your in-game profile to the other people in your league or quick play game. There are also a number of in-game leader boards, including general ones as well as specific ones for the different sports supported by the game.<br><br>MLSN also allows you to send an SMS invite to your friends, giving them a mechanism to get the game as well.

Description=In NBC Sports Figure Skating, you’ll take the role of one of the world’s best female skaters and compete against athletes from other countries to become a star on ice by successfully executing a series of skating moves.  From the main menu, you choose number of players (single player or two player hot seat), program type (Short, Free or Overall), and the country you want to represent.  The game is then viewed from a side on perspective with a large view of your skater to emphasize the action.  Each skating move has a series of button presses and timing cues. For each button press in the move you are to perform, a picture a number from 1 to 6 (randomly chosen by the game) moves across the bottom of the screen to a target zone at the center.  As soon as a number appears in the Move Alert Brackets at the bottom center of the screen, you must press that number key to successfully execute the next step of the move sequence.  If you miss a button completely while executing a move, you’ll fall and receive no points for that move. Each number in the sequence appears within a colored square. A failed sequence step is displayed in red squares.  A successful sequence step is displayed in orange squares.  A perfectly timed sequence step is displayed in green squares.  The next sequence step is displayed in black squares.  Each move has its own unique point value, based on its difficulty, for a perfect execution. You will incur a 1-point penalty for each .5 sec missed execution, modified by the game’s difficulty level setting. The difficulty setting also adjusts how high your competitor’s score will be.  However, if you do not fall during your routine, you will be awarded with bonus points, based on how many moves you’ve chained together.  After you complete a routine, you’ll receive two values. One represents the real figure skating score from 0.0 to 6.0, while the other represents a point value. The point value has a larger range based on the types of moves you do and your overall performance is what is used for scoring.  Scores can be uploaded after the medal ceremony for an event if you win the Gold Medal. Your scores are entered into a website leaderboard that tracks the top scores and players.  If you are playing a Free or Overall Program, you can also assemble your own performance lineup. You can choose any of the 10 different moves and put together a sequence of 10 moves to create your own custom routine. Using a move more than twice in a row halves the point value for the move.

Description=Pac-Man: Championship edition is a sequel, by the same developer Toru Iwatani, done in the style of the original classic. As before, you are Pac-Man and you are in a maze with dots, power pellets and hosts.  The object is to eat the dots and avoid the ghosts, unless you eat a power pellet, which gives you the ability to eat the ghosts for a few seconds.<br><br>What's new here is many different mazes and modes.  This is designed from the ground up as a console game, so some arcade traditions are lost.  The object is no longer to try to survive/get a high score without losing quarters, but to get a high score in a set time limit.  You do still have a set number of lives, which makes your time end early if you lose all them.<br><br>Unlike the original or its prodigy, Championship Edition isn't broken into distinct levels.  Once you clear one side of the maze, a fruit appears on the other side.  Eating the fruit regenerates the empty half with new walls, dots, power pellets, etc and increases the game speed.<br><br>The iPhone version of the game adds two additional modes.  In "Mission Mode", you must clear a specific goal set by the game at the beginning of play (such as eating two apples, or eating eight ghosts consecutively).  In "Challenge Mode", you must aim to achieve the top score for each course, but this time the ghosts have been sped up so that they are initially much faster.<br><br>The look is a bright neon which evokes the classic Pac-Man but takes advantage of nearly 30 years of increased computer power.

In total there are 10 magic powers, each tied to a character that can be chosen before a level. On the bottom of the screen is a bucket that moves left and right. Hitting the bucket results in an extra ball. For each level, the player has 10 balls to use.<br><br>Four game modes are available.

In the quick play mode, players can freely play any of the levels that have been completed in the adventure mode. In the duel mode, players can compete against a human or computer opponent.

Description=Powerboat Challenge is a powerboat racing game. The player has to race his boat round buoys; red buoys must be passed on the left, the green ones must be passed on the right. The closer the player passes to the buoy, the more style points he or she gets and the more boost is given to the boat. When the boost meter is full, the player can use it to speed up the boat for a while. If one buoy is missed, the player loses all his or her boost charge and the boat slows down; if three buoys are missed, he or she is disqualified from that race. A style rating is also given by the end of each race.<br><br>In race events, arriving among the 3 first places awards the player a medal (gold, silver or bronze) and a prize in money. In time trials the player has to beat a pre-defined time to earn the medals. In eliminator courses the last placed player on each lap gets knocked out and in best overall courses the results are determined not only by the place in which the player gets but how well he or she raced. The money can be used to buy boat upgrades. In the beginning of the game the player can select one of four characters with different ratings on attributes such as top speed, acceleration, agility and turbo. The upgrades bought will improve the boat in those attributes.<br><br>The game features 4 islands (Richmore, Brookfield, Culuá and Akonisos) with different scenarios (swamps, icy seas, rainforest rivers) and events in each of them. Collecting enough medals unlocks new islands. After beating the game with a given character, the player can replay the entire game with a different one.

In distance mode players skip it as far as possible, while in splash mode players get it to splash as many times as possible. <br><br>The throw is made by hitting a power bar when it is as high as possible. Once the stone has left the thrower's hand, the player takes control of it. The goal is to make the stone bounce on the water by pressing the button at the right time. Success with this will make the stone maintain its height and speed. If the button is pressed too early or late, the stone will lose power and when the power bar is completely empty, the stone will sink. Further into the game there are additional power-ups and obstacles. One example is a  power-up  that can increase or decrease the speed and jumping height of the stone. Another will make it invisible. There are also whales that give extra splashes to the stones from their water spouts, octopuses that change the target and tornadoes that make the phone vibrate.

Description=This mobile game recreates the events of the movie from a isometric perspective. The game has seven action packed levels that each differs in gameplay. What they all have in common are quick time events that appear frequently. The levels play as follows:<br>1. Battle of Hoth: The player takes control of Luke and has to defend the rebel base by destroying the AT-AT walkers. The level consists of two parts. First the player has to avoid getting shot down by steering left or right to dodge the enemy lasers. Once getting close to the walkers the player has to release his harpoon and use it to tie up the walker's legs. This is done by first quickly pressing the directional keys in the order that is displayed on the screen and then pressing left and right alternately to keep a marker in the middle of a meter.<br><br>2. Dagobah Search: Luke arrives at Dagobah and has to find Yoda. The gameplay here involves navigating through the swamps, jumping over geysers and dodging the flying creature that comes in the player's path.<br><br> <br>Asteroid Field: The player here takes control of Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon and has to flee from the Imperials through an asteroid field. This works similarly to the first level and has three parts. First the player has to avoid being hit by asteroids by simply moving left or right. After a while the player will need to initiate emergency acceleration to avoid being overtaken by the Imperials. This is done simply by taping a button repeatedly. Lastly the player has to defend against Tie Fighters. This is done by moving the crosshair over the enemy ships and shooting before they have time to shoot.<br><br>3. Jedi Training: Back at Dagobah Luke begins his training with Yoda in his quest to become a Jedi. This is done through a number of challenges. First the player has to run across the forest and jump over swamps. Luke runs automatically and all the player has to do is to press the jump button at the right time or he will get wet. Sometimes a liana can be used to swing across a swamp. Secondly he has to do a balancing exercise where he stands on his hands with Yoda above him. This is done by pressing left and right repeatedly. Thirdly he has to use the force to lift R2-D2 and some stones in the air. This is done by repeatedly pressing the directional keys, where each key represents an object.<br><br>4. Cloud City and Bespin Vaults: These two levels work the same. Luke arrives at Cloud City where he finds out that his friends have been captured by Darth Vader. The player has to move Luke between predefined covers and with the press of a button lean out and shoot at the stormtroopers. In some parts of the levels Luke also gets to use his lightsaber in close combat fights. <br><br>5. I am Your Father: Luke finally gets to meet Darth Vader face to face. Now the player has to defend himself in a lightsaber fight while resisting the temptation to attack. The player blocks Vader's attacks by pressing a button when a marker runs through the green sectors of a circle. Luke gains Dark Side points when hit and it's important to not let the Dark Side meter fill up. The level also has a part where Luke has to press buttons to avoid being hit by flying objects.<br><br>6. Clouds of Bespin: The player gets to control the Millenium Falcon once again in and attempt to save Luke. This level involves the laser dodging of the first level and shooting of the asteroid field level.

According to folklore, the island is cursed and full of traps. That each path to the treasures is blocked with impenetrable stone gates doesn't make it easier for the pirates. The pirate captain however won't give up without trying, and orders his crew to set up the big cannon. <br><br>Like in Gamevil's earlier games, Skipping Stone and NOM, the game is controlled with only one button. The idea of the game is to navigate a bomb through a network of baskets. Each level of the game has two cannons, and a number of baskets in between that are used to move the bomb from the cannon at the bottom of the playfield to the one at the top. You have no control over the movement of the baskets, as they move in predefined patterns (both vertically, horizontally and diagonally). Therefore timing is crucial when you launch the bomb from one basket to another. You'll also come across different traps and obstacles, that you have to use to your advantage. Once a level is complete, the stone gate blocking the way will be destroyed and you can go on to the next level, being one step closer to the treasures.<br><br>In addition to the story mode, the game also offers an endless mode, which works the same way except that it picks levels randomly and goes on till the player has lost all his bombs. After that, the player can submit his score to the Gamevil Live leaderboard.

Description=Trivial Pursuit is an adaptation of the board game of the same name. The game can be played in two modes. Classic-mode is an exact duplicate of the original game. The players control a cake-form which can hold six pieces. The board is shaped like a wheel and divided into squares with six of them being so-called category headquarters. The goal of the game is to land on each of those category headquarters and answer the corresponding question correctly which in turn earns the player a corresponding piece to fill up the cake-form. Once he has collected all six pieces, the player has to move back to the center of the board for the final question. If he gets the answer right, he wins the game.<br><br>To get on the category headquarters, the up to four players or bots (virtually) throw a six-sided dice. Every player can roll the dice as many times as he manages to answer the question corresponding to the category of the square he lands on after moving his cake-form. The same system is used in Pursuit-mode but instead of collecting six pieces to win, the sole goal is to get from one end of the custom-made board to the other.

Blazkowicz will meet the enemy head-on, emancipate the prisoners and bring the Axis to its knees.<br><br>Wolfenstein RPG is a first-person role-playing game that takes place in the world of Wolfenstein. The shooter's quick action has been traded in for a slowed down turn-based one where emphasis is placed on using the correct weapons or tools at the right time with the right enemies. Emphasis has also been placed on collecting treasures, finding secrets and reading books that are found along the way and that can either aid by strengthening the character or in some circumstances weakening him with the drivel written within.<br><br>The game's nine levels take Blazkowicz from prisons, to research labs, to sewers, and even to the grounds of Castle Wolfenstein. In his path there are thirty-two different kinds of enemies ranging from familiar Wolfenstein classics like guards and zombies to newly invented genetic monsters. Scientists and Engineers can help guide Blazkowicz if he manages to bribe them, but beware of loyal ones who will try to inject him with poisonous syringes. Blazkowicz' arsenal naturally includes fists and boots but he will also find machine guns, flame throwers, dynamite, rocket launchers and others that will total up to sixteen different ways of maiming Axis scum. <br><br>Besides the gold loot and books to collect as B.J. he can also find empty syringes and loose ingredients and serums that can be combined to use in specialized machines that provide special abilities like super strength, fire deterrents, and health-ups. One last important thing strewn about the world of Wolfenstein RPG are chickens. Chickens can be either roasted and turned in to health-ups or can be kicked into the same purpose. Mini-games are also available some within the game and some from the main menu. Mini-games include Chicken Kicking where the objective is to kick chickens into a targeted area to earn different points or a simple War card game where you collected gold can be bet.

Description=The year is 2011 and New York is hit by a wave of terrorist attacks. The police hasn't been able to take care of the threat and therefore different private forces have been created. In Zombie Infection the player takes control of members of one such team, the Inside the Action team. The team is followed by a live TV crew and has therefore become very popular. It's not uncommon to see large crowds gathering outside the crime scenes cheering for their favourite team. As the game starts the team arrives at the scene of a possible homicide, but it doesn't take long before they realize that it is no ordinary murder. A virus has been released that turns people into bloodthirsty zombies! Now the team has to go out and eradicate the zombies, find out who is responsible and save the world!<br><br>Zombie Infection is an action horror game with some adventure elements, viewed from a top-down perspective. At the start of the game the player takes control of Anderson, the leader of the team. When encountering an enemy Anderson automatically draws his gun and a vertically moving crosshair appears in front of the enemy. The player needs to time the shots to do as much damage as possible. A well aimed headshot is enough to take down any zombie. At the start of the game the player has a simple handgun, but at checkpoints he can buy new and more powerful weapons of all different kinds. There are also other items that can be bought, such as health packs and energy drinks. The player pays with points that he earns for taking down enemies. In addition to killing things the player can interact with different people and objects. Some objects can be grabbed, pushed or kicked away. The player can also pick up items that can be combined to create new ones. <br><br>Later in the game the player also gets to take control of the other two members of the team, Mike and Shawna. For each character the play style is different. While Anderson is trained in using guns and heavy weapons, Mike prefers melee combat. Early on in the game he finds a katana but he can also do ranged combat with shurikens. Shawna is the journalist of the team and always carries a camera with her. Playing as Shawna is therefore less combat-oriented and more about stealth. With her camera she can tape things she sees and then sell it as exclusives. She can also use a lock pick to get access to otherwise locked down areas. Some monsters need darkness to be protected and these can only be taken down after being weakened by the light of Shawna's camera.
