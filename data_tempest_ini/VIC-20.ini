Description=Apple Panic is a platform game based on the arcade game Space Panic (1980, Universal) and ported to the Apple II by Ben Serki. You control a digger, armed with his shovel, and you must kill your opponents - the evil legged apples.<br><br>Your character can only walk left/right and climb up/down the ladders - no jumping - and if the apples touch you, you'll lose.<br><br>To kill an apple you must dig a hole on the ground and wait for one of them to get stuck on it. Then you must hit it with your shovel to make it fall to the level bellow. The apples die if the fall is big enough. Depending on their color, they may require from 1 to 3-level falls, so you may have to dig several aligned holes. Besides, the higher the fall, the higher you score.<br><br>Each level is timed so you must take out all the apples quickly, or you'll lose. If you're successful, the next levels will feature more and more enemies than the previous one.

Armour, an orb and an eagle are among the helpful objects in completing your quest.

Description=Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves.) Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.<br><br>Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.<br><br>Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted.

Description=A simple but technically accomplished game for the VIC-20, Dragonwing puts you in a spaceship flying through a system of caves at a very fast pace. As you move along, and try not to crash into the undulating cave walls, you expend fuel, and must pick up new fuel supplies from the cave floor. Unlike Scramble or Super Cobra, flying through the caves is not easy, even though they are not guarded by missile silos. Since your vehicle is not a helicopter, but a rocket, you fly through the caves at a very fast pace and without stopping. The laws of gravity an inertia mean that you can't adjust your pace with pixel precision. Instead, your altitude must be consistently altered so that you do not crash into the ground, while you have to compensate your maneuvers so as not to crash into the ceiling.<br><br>Programmed in 2002, Dragonwing has little in common with the VIC-20 games of twenty years earlier, what with multicolor sprites, smooth fast scrolling and a breakbeat soundtrack played throughout the game, despite running on an unexpanded VIC-20.

Description=Temple of Apshai is the first in Automated Simulations' Dunjonquest series of role-playing games series and one of the first computer role-playing games. <br><br>The game could be described as a graphical "roguelike", but actually it resembles the mainframe classic DND more, as you cannot see the whole level, but only your surroundings. Furthermore, the level maps are not randomized like in Rogue. Still, the gameplay has a lot in common with Rogue and other early dungeon crawls: A solo character explores a monster-infested, multi-level dungeon to grab some treasure, everything in top-down view.<br><br>The game starts at the Innkeeper by creating a new character (if you already played the game, you can use characters that you created). You get different stat values (in Dungeons & Dragons style) as well as an amount of money that you can spend on weapons, armor and other equipment. Alternatively, you can just enter the stats to "import" characters from other role-playing games. (This is also used as a primitive "save / load game" mechanism.)<br><br>After character generation, you enter the dungeons. On the left, the current room of the dungeon is displayed; the character status and other info are displayed on the right. One thing that sets Temple of Apshai apart from other rpg is that the manual contains detailed room descriptions for each room (that may contain hints about traps or treasures), to create atmosphere despite crude graphics.<br><br>You move about and perform actions like opening doors, firing arrows, examining walls for secret doors etc. by pressing key commands. Moving is also done without cursor keys: You turn your character into the direction you want to go and then move him forward by 1 to 9 steps, also selectable by single keystrokes. But take care of fatigue: If you keep running all the time, your fatigue rises, and if it reaches 100%, you cannot move or act for some time -- which can be deadly in the presence of, say, a Giant Bombardier Beetle.<br><br>Each room may contain treasures to pick up (sometimes just trash, sometimes gold, sometimes useful items), secret doors which lead to hidden parts of the dungeon and traps, which obviously should be avoided (you can try to search for them). Of course, you will also encounter monsters -- a variety of undead or giant insects -- which you have to fight using turn-based combat. Apart from the normal attack, there is also the thrust (which is more effective, but risky), and you can also fire arrows at distance or parry. To avoid a fight, you may also try to speak to them.<br><br>If you return to the Innkeeper, you gain experience, which increases your stats. Still, if you quit the game, the only way to save your character is to write down the stats on paper and re-entering them the next time you play.

Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?<br><br>Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase).  The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.

You, of course, are the computer expert, and your skills will be put to the test, typing in included BASIC programs to decrypt secret messages, weigh tolerances, plot courses through labyrinths and calculate necessary angles of deflection.  The abilities of the whole team will be called for to overcome natural obstacles, untrusting natives, the sapping effects of the Devorim Force, BRUTE agents, a traitor in your midst, the perils and traps of the golden lost city containing the artifact, and the deadly artifact itself!<br><br>Though the story shares the dynamic 2nd-person perspective ("You try to talk, but you cannot make a sound") of Choose-Your-Own-Adventures, the text (like most books) is a non-interactive fixed-rail trip of zero interactivity -- however, some of the type-in programs included offer numerous outcomes, moving into the "game" field what might otherwise be best categorized as an elaborate set-up for low-impact programming exercises.<br><br>An appendix is included describing how to modify the BASIC program listings for greatest compatibility with 10 of the most popular home microcomputer BASICs, as well as describing what each program does and how it works.

The first of the three games (each with four skill levels, demanding faster reflexes) presents the player with falling letters which must be typed correctly before hitting the bottom of the screen... and eventually the game's mascot floats down defying the player to type in an entire word.  The second game takes word-typing as a given skill, as the player is now in charge of typing in the full names of icons of common household objects gradually floating down the screen.  In the third game, an object is named on the bottom of the screen and the player must punch in the correct number corresponding to the object's icon, displayed on screen.<br><br>The second and third games have bonus rounds whose gameplay is as the regular rounds, except that the icons are now partially obscured, demanding a certain exercise of player memory faculties.

After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!

At the beginning of each level, three enemy snakes will also enter the maze. To complete the level, you need to eat all of the enemy snakes. If an enemy snake has more segments than your snake, you can only eat segments that form the tail of the snake; a collision with the head is lethal! Each time you eat a segment, the enemy snake will become smaller until eventually you can devour it completely. For enemy snakes that have fewer segments than you, you can eat the tail segments or the head segment. From time to time, a frog will appear in the maze; eating this will cause your snake to grow. Both your snake and enemy snakes will leave eggs behind occasionally; left alone, these will hatch (your eggs earn you an extra life, enemy eggs will hatch another snake). Eggs can also be eaten to remove them from the playfield, so it's usually a good idea to eat enemy eggs before a new snake hatches! The maze changes for each level, and the enemy snakes progressively become larger and tougher to catch.

You are presented with a grid of 24 squares, each of which has lines around it, and your task is to colour in the whole grid. this is done by moving across these lines so as to colour each square individually. If you overshoot the one of the edges, or are forced to go into a different direction, you lose any lines which have been coloured on that block. Each square that you colour must already be next to one which is already coloured, but any sides which have already been used as part of another completed row needn't be re-coloured. Trying to stop you doing this are up to 9 aliens, each of which costs you a life on contact. After completing a level you get 10 seconds to eat the aliens for points, a lá Pac-Man

Description=Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of Turmoil is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.<br><br>The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way.<br> <br>When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.

Description=ViColumn is, as one might guess, a re-implementation of Sega's Columns for the VIC-20. Blocks of three vertically arranged colours, out of a pallette of four, come dropping down from above, and must be placed on the bottom or on top of another block. By pressing fire, you can rotate the colours inside the block so as to fit in with the colours of other blocks already placed on the screen. If three or more adjacent blocks have the same colour on a row or column, that colour block is eliminated, making room for more blocks. Carefully laying down the blocks can lead to chain reactions. Unlike the original Columns, though, this implementation does not recognise diagonal colour combinations.

Description=VIC Scramble is another Scramble for the VIC-20, but with some alterations that make it stand out. As usual, you fly with a ship through a system of caves, but this cave lacks the usual roof. You shoot or drop bombs at the usual missiles, saucers and fuel pods, but in this version, you don't shoot and bomb simultaneously. Bombs are released by pulling back on the joystick with the fire button pressed. Of course, this means that you can't go back and forth as usual, instead your ship is glued to the back of the screen. While the scrolling is forced, pushing forward makes it speed up, so that you can fly away from missiles and other threats. As you go deeper into the caves, the border colour changes.

Description=VIQ-Bert is perhaps not the first, or even the best variation on Q*Bert for the VIC-20, but it is by far the smallest, weighing in at under a single kilobyte (programmed for the 2002 edition of the MiniGame Compo coding contest).<br><br>As in the original Q*Bert, the player moves on a 3D pyramid, coloring the fields of the pyramid as he/she/it moves. Coloring all tiles clears the level. This would be easy were it not for the enemies moving around in haphazard patterns on the same pyramid. Unlike the original Q*Bert enemies, they don't change back the color of the game tiles, but contact is deadly. Another way to die is to fall off the pyramid. Later levels require coloring the same squares multiple times, and even later, you cannot pass the same square twice without changing the color back, so a strategy element is introduced.

Starting the game standing over his coffin, you wander the length and breadth of his castle in pursuit of a recipe and the verbal and material components needed to cast an antidote to counter his occult menace.  It contains good-luck charms, the sorts of mad scientist chemical concoctions that might well yield a Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation, a flighty medium and her crystal ball, and no small quantity of juju, useful for all sorts of voodoo applications.  All that and a chimneysweep trapped in the flue!  The player will navigate all these and more with the trademark Adventure International VERB NOUN two-word text parser.

Description=When Tetris first appeared, the VIC-20 was already commercially dead, and it didn't receive an official port. In 2002, one version was developed for the annual Minigame compo, a coding competition with strict size targets. Zapactris, taking its name from programmer Anders "Zapac" Carlsson, was thus crammed into 1 kilobyte, while still being a fairly faithful replica of the original albeit without all the spit and polish of some Tetris variations, such as bonus points for eliminating multiple lines.
