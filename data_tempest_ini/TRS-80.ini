Description=As the Great Venicksia, legendary conjuror and Ghost Exterminator Extraordinaire, you may have finally met your match. This town is crawling with ghosts! Stepping off the train at the depot, your objective is walk to the haunted house and back, blasting as many ghosts as you can along the way. Your weapon is your own design, a "Ghost Blaster," capable of steady fire, though short, controlled bursts are the better option. The ghosts, of course, want you to panic. They're here to scare you to death, and to that end, each one that escapes will awaken the next, more dangerous ghost. When the thirteenth ghost appears, it's curtains for you.<br><br>This early first-person shooter presents you with a panoply of ghosts in classical forms drifting and darting across the detailed backdrop of a Western ghost town. As you shoot ghosts, you advance across the backdrop: bigger steps for more dangerous ghosts. Your passage is made more complicated by a laughing ghost whose head pops up briefly and must also be shot to prevent the ghost counter from ticking forward. Some help is provided by spiders, of whom the ghosts are afraid; shoot a spider and the ghost counter goes down, though then ghosts swarm back _en masse_. Your Ghost Blaster is represented by a movable sight on the screen, but it takes more than just a quick trigger finger to hit a ghost. You must lead your targets. This is the only sense of depth the game screen gives, except when that final ghost comes rushing out to get you.<br><br>Each pass through town is rewarded with a musical refrain, which changes from level to level. A successful round trip moves you up one level, which changes the background slightly and treats you to clever names like "Dead of Night" and "Good Mourning." There are bonus trips to be a discovered and even a secret behind the appearance of spiders and the mysterious laughing head. If you beat all thirty-two levels, you are truly a Ghost Exterminator Extraordinaire.

Description=The engine of your airplane stops while you are flying over the amazon forest, forcing it to make an emergency landing. Alone and without proper equipment, you need to transverse the great forest to reach civilization while avoiding deadly wild animals and several other kinds of dangers on the way.<br><br>Amazônia is a text-adventure in Portuguese from Brazil. One of the first computer games commercially released on that country, it has a parser inspired by the ones of Infocom and other companies, although not nearly as sophisticated (it has a small vocabulary of  40 or so verbs, it can't process chain commands, but understands pronouns). One unique characteristic of it is the requirement of accentuation on the Portuguese words. The game even provides special key combinations as shortcuts for accents to ensure compatibility with all systems.<br><br>Given the plot line, the gameplay has a strong emphasis on its survival aspect: even though it is written in first person, the game bizarrely complains about being thirsty ("Hey, I'm thirsty!"). Wild animals randomly appear to threaten the player, and must be dealt swiftly to avoid death.

Description=Early (1983) TRS-80 BASIC text adventure game, the middle in a forgotten trilogy (sandwiched between "Project Triad" and "Codename Intrepid"), remembered for its no-holds-barred approach to math and logic concepts informing game settings and puzzles: in one section, sparking a genre cliche, one has to play a text adventure game inside the text adventure game; in another, one falls asleep and in a dream constructs a proof utilising physical representations of various components of symbolic logic; additional game areas are accessed by pushing and popping the stack, objects extruded from 2 to 3 dimensions by _y_ing them.<br><br>The supporting documentation understates when it claims the scenario for the adventure is meant to be vague -- searching for a 12-word code phrase (unlocked in chunks upon completion of certain puzzles) is just an excuse for sending an unwary player through an alien and abstract setting two words at a time (using VERB NOUN gameplay with a vocabulary of about 200.)<br><br>Later (1988) versions of this game were ported in C to Solaris, Atari ST and MS-DOS environments; more recently, in December 2003, Andrew Plotkin ported it to the interactive fiction standard of machine-independent Z-code.

Tyrants built fortresses to protect themselves from one another.<br><br>Now centuries later, as the descendants of those ancients, you want to unite the provinces.  To do so however, you must fight, until only one leader remains. Only then will the serfs be freed from their servitude and peace and prosperity come again.<br><br>Gameplay is similar to typical board wargames with hex squares, but being on the computer, the rules can be far more complex and realistic than in a board game.

When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.

Description=Temple of Apshai is the first in Automated Simulations' Dunjonquest series of role-playing games series and one of the first computer role-playing games. <br><br>The game could be described as a graphical "roguelike", but actually it resembles the mainframe classic DND more, as you cannot see the whole level, but only your surroundings. Furthermore, the level maps are not randomized like in Rogue. Still, the gameplay has a lot in common with Rogue and other early dungeon crawls: A solo character explores a monster-infested, multi-level dungeon to grab some treasure, everything in top-down view.<br><br>The game starts at the Innkeeper by creating a new character (if you already played the game, you can use characters that you created). You get different stat values (in Dungeons & Dragons style) as well as an amount of money that you can spend on weapons, armor and other equipment. Alternatively, you can just enter the stats to "import" characters from other role-playing games. (This is also used as a primitive "save / load game" mechanism.)<br><br>After character generation, you enter the dungeons. On the left, the current room of the dungeon is displayed; the character status and other info are displayed on the right. One thing that sets Temple of Apshai apart from other rpg is that the manual contains detailed room descriptions for each room (that may contain hints about traps or treasures), to create atmosphere despite crude graphics.<br><br>You move about and perform actions like opening doors, firing arrows, examining walls for secret doors etc. by pressing key commands. Moving is also done without cursor keys: You turn your character into the direction you want to go and then move him forward by 1 to 9 steps, also selectable by single keystrokes. But take care of fatigue: If you keep running all the time, your fatigue rises, and if it reaches 100%, you cannot move or act for some time -- which can be deadly in the presence of, say, a Giant Bombardier Beetle.<br><br>Each room may contain treasures to pick up (sometimes just trash, sometimes gold, sometimes useful items), secret doors which lead to hidden parts of the dungeon and traps, which obviously should be avoided (you can try to search for them). Of course, you will also encounter monsters -- a variety of undead or giant insects -- which you have to fight using turn-based combat. Apart from the normal attack, there is also the thrust (which is more effective, but risky), and you can also fire arrows at distance or parry. To avoid a fight, you may also try to speak to them.<br><br>If you return to the Innkeeper, you gain experience, which increases your stats. Still, if you quit the game, the only way to save your character is to write down the stats on paper and re-entering them the next time you play.

Description=ELIZA was the first chatterbot to make a splash in popular culture, originally written and conceived by Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT in 1966 to mockingly ape the style of a person-centered ("Rogerian") psychotherapist or counselor, largely by prompting the user to elaborate on topics sampled from previous user input.  A typical session would take the form of a typed dialogue (sometimes with simulated typing errors to further the suspension of disbelief), with the computer asking the user a series of questions and being fed responses from which to generate further questions.<br><br>ELIZA stimulated early consideration of computer artificial intelligence (or the appearance thereof), not infrequently passing the Turing test and fooling users into believing (for a little while, at least) that they were interacting with a real human being on the other end... blazing a trail subsequently followed down by Perry the Paranoid and Racter.  Additionally, the nods its conversational interface made toward natural language processing (or, again, the appearance thereof) are considered to have been influential on the early mainframe development of the interface for text adventure games such as Adventure and Zork.<br><br>Considered as a game, ELIZA is nearly the polar opposite to Emily Short's Galatea -- instead of the player probing the computer with questions, the computer probes the player with them.  Many different stories will still be revealed, but in this case, that's because it'll be people tricked by the program into telling them.

YOU WILL BE BESET FROM TIME TO TIME BY NATURAL EVENTS.<br>Results of your actions are narrated to you in plain text; player input primarily consists of punching in numbers and selecting the occasional YES and NO (the end of every turn typically asking you DO YOU WISH TO ABDICATE?) into your keyboard, touchscreen -- or TeleType terminal.  Gameplay and interaction are restrictive, but the minimalist number-crunching is foundational for all the managerial leadership games that followed: You can buy and sell acres of land, purchasing extra bushels of grain to sow in your fields or feed your populace if so needed.  Between turns (only 10 on the iPhone version), citizens starve and are laid low by plagues, peasants immigrate to replace them, and vermin deplete your stores of grain reserves.  One year is much the same as the next, though the particular numerical values shift according to elegant algorithms the deeper understanding of which will lead you to a fruitful and harmonious reign, concluding with enthusiastic congratulations from the computer:<br><br>A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE!!!

Then there is a gentle art to a winning bid, striking some point on a Laffer curve not too high to be accepted but not too low to yield significant profits.  Random factors are tempered with general rules, such as the documentation's suggestion to "Make note that usually the more expensive bridges will mean bigger costs, hence you are capable of making larger bids, and therefore make larger profits."<br><br>Once the player successfully amasses $500 million in profits, they are declared chairman of the board and the game concludes.

KING.)<br><br>At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace.  However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger.<br><br>Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves.  Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies.  If, after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled!<br><br>Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death.

In their bid to conquer the galaxy, the Jovians are attacking United Planet System bases; when no base remains, your mission ends in failure.<br><br>Scanners will help you find the Jovians and the bases, hyperdrive will get you there, and Masers and Triton Missiles will blast the Jovian ships into the ether. It's best to go in with deflectors up, because the game is real-time and the Jovians will start firing before you do. A full damage report is available, with the fastest repairs done at one of the bases. Combat is especially challenging because you must issue numeric commands, including direction and firepower, while listening to the Jovians blast away at you (sound effects driving home the urgency of your situation). Even outside of combat, the Jovian ships will move from quadrant to quadrant, and you may have to fight through magnetic storms or even around invisible black holes.<br><br>The action is shown via a map of your quadrant, including stars, ships and bases. The general status is directly below that, while scanning and damage reports are shown separately. Ten levels of play vary the number of enemy ships and the bases in jeopardy, to the point of making victory far from inevitable on the higher levels.

Description=The year is 2186. Humanity has established colonies on the moon, Mars, and several of the larger asteroids. Earth's sky is dotted with space habitats, and the spaceways are always busy. As usual, there is the urgent need for energy to power this advanced civilization; one of the primary sources of that energy is quantum black holes.<br><br>In STARCROSS, you are a miner of black holes, scouring the asteroid belt in your one-man survey ship. Finding and harnessing a single black hole can make a person's fortune. It's a lonely business, fraught with the known and unknown hazards of space. You've equipped your ship, the M.C.S. STARCROSS, with the best gear you could afford. You've put everything into this venture, and though you've tried before, you somehow sense that this time will be different.<br><br>The ship's computer handles the functions of navigation and routine maintenance. You watch the sophisticated mass detector as it unceasingly scans the vicinity for uncharted masses. To assuage the tedium of your long trip, you browse through the compact tape library, a compendium of human knowledge and culture. But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into a deep sleep.<br><br>As you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if your search for a quantum black hole is successful. Little do you suspect that the alarm on your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream - but not to grapple with the long-sought black hole. Your quest has taken an unexpected turn, for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan alien spaceship from the outer fringes of the galaxy.

The Fighters just shoot at you, where the Annihilators, for instance, drop a ticking mine canister which wipes out the entire warbase. The translocator doesn't appear until you've destroyed the guards, and if you take too long with that, the Vexers arrive, making a beeline for your ship, walls notwithstanding.<br><br>You are far from helpless, however. Your ship can shoot in four directions and comes equipped with hyperdrive units, which are partially replenished by each translocator you nab.

You can generate an antimatter field, too; that destroys all the walls, another life-saver when you're racing to the translocator with Vexers hot on your tail.<br><br>As you might expect, bonus ships are granted at point thresholds, and the warbases go on and on.
