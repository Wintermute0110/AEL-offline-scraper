Description=Crazee Rider is the spiritual successor to Superior Software's Overdrive. Originally envisioned as a car racing game it was turned into a motorcycle racer during development. Players need to race opponents over different tracks, starting out at the 60th position. To progress the player has to end in the top six of the pack in a single lap. Compared to Overdrive there are more opportunities to avoid opponents and tracks also have bends. Two keys are used to speed up or down and two others to steer. For bonus points it is possible to bump into the sides of other opponents. This does not slow them down, it only provides points. Driving straight into them from the back slows down the player's motorcycle significantly. This also happens when the curb is hit while taking corners at a high speed. A mini-map of the track is shown near the top of the screen, along with the score. The current position and the speed is shown at the bottom.<br><br>The BBC Micro release contains a standard and an enhanced version. The enhanced version uses different colours, has more variety in the clothing of opponents, and contains a music track.

When an alien vessel approaches, the sights (cross-hair) changes, indicating when there is a good chance of a hit. When it changes a second time, it locks onto the enemy. Only a laser weapon can be fired and it takes some time to recharge.<br><br>The screen shows the player's score, the high score, the status of the mothership, the remaining strength of the shields, the amount of fuel left, and various indicators for climb/turn ratio and the lasers.

The object of stages one, two and three is to reach the top of the screen where your girlfriend is guarded by the eponymous Killer Gorilla. On stage four the objective is to remove the rivets from the girders, causing the top of the building to collapse and the gorilla to fall.

Killer Gorilla is a clone of Nintendo's Donkey Kong arcade game.<br><br>On stage one, the gorilla rolls barrels down the screen. These can be avoided, jumped over, or smashed with a hammer that can be collected and carried for a short time. If a barrel reaches the flaming barrel at the bottom of the screen, it will sometimes become a fireball that rolls erratically along girders and up and down ladders.<br><br>On stage two, conveyor belts that occasionally change direction carry trays of cement that are fatal to the touch. Fireballs appear from a central furnace. Ladders to the top level extend and retract.

The choice is fairly arbitrary, as you can rename the team, you always start in the lowest of the four divisions, and the kits aren't real-life.<br><br>You start with only 11 players, and the maximum is 15, so you'll be keen to sign new players, and you get this opportunity after each match, when a player is offered, with his skill and form displayed. You can train your players to improve these skills, and sell players you don't rate highly.<br><br>Matches are played out via a succession of short animations, in which the home side wears red and the away side blue. At full time you are told how many injuries were incurred. The league season features 15 matches, one against each team, with the top two teams gaining promotion.

In each classroom, Mikie has to collect all the hearts that are found in each classroom to form a message. In order to collect these hearts, Mikie must stand somewhere near them and shout out. There are two type of hearts: small  and large. Mikie needs to shout out only once to collect the small hearts, and multiple times to collect the large ones. When a message is formed, Mikie can exit the classroom through a door marked OUT.<br><br>Stopping him from collecting the hearts is the teacher, the chef, and the janitor. The teacher is the worst one. When he is unable to  catch you, he works up a sweat, and eventually, throws his teeth at you. When his teeth hits Mikie, he loses one of his three lives. In later classrooms, Mikie can throw stuff at his enemies in order to stun them for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs in the locker room, and the chickens in the canteen). The janitor isn't as bad because he walks much slower than the others.<br><br>In between levels, you have to enter the next classroom through a door marked IN without being caught, but you can do at least two things to pass time: Steal some lunch, and open one of the unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the chance to see a naked lady with breasts. Beware that if you take too long in the hallway and don't travel between floors, a bucket slides across the screen real fast and attempt to slip you.<br><br>If you're good enough at the game, you can enter a high score, and if you fail to enter anything, the game will assume that you are Clint Eastwood.

Description=Osprey! is an educational game based at Loch Garten in Scotland and developed in conjunction with the RSPB (The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). The object of the game is to allocate wardens to help the ospreys successfully nest, rear young and survive the hazards that threaten them.<br><br>The player is appointed as leader of the RSPB project, 'Save the Ospreys!' The game can be started from any year between 1965 and 1979 and ends in 1981 or when all ospreys have been lost, the earlier the start year the harder the game. The number of wardens available each season varies, so some seasons there may be a shortage while at other times tasks may be easier. Weather also has an effect on the results. <br><br>The wardens can be allocated to three areas;<br><br>Looking after the main site, which involves preventing the public from disturbing the birds.<br>Preventing egg stealing.<br>                                                     Making people aware of ospreys, which has a wider effect on survival.<br><br>The game is based on the efforts taken by the RSPB at the site in Scotland after it was discovered that ospreys had returned to Scotland to breed, after many years of only being seen as a rare visitor. The manual provides a detailed look at ospreys and their history in Scotland. Also included is a table showing the number of pairs breeding from 1954 to 1981 and how many were successful, this can be compared with the game results.

Description=Overdrive is a racing game similar to Pole Position but only with straight tracks, without bends. The five tracks have different scenes such as fields, night, snow, desert and riverside. Starting at the end the player needs to finish among the top of the racing pack to progress. This is visualized through a bar at the top of the screen. For every car that is overtaken, the indicator moves to the right. The player needs to reach the blue part of the bar to move on. At the end bonus points are awarded for every car that was passed.<br><br>The car can be moved into five areas of the track. Two keys are used to accelerate or slow down. Racing at a high speed is required to finish in the top in time, but that also makes it more difficult not to crash into the other cars. When destroyed the game can be immediately continued, but the speed needs to be built up again. Opponents can also crash into the back of the player's car when the speed is too slow. The progress is not saved, so when a course is not finished in time it needs to be started from the first stage again.

Description=Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.<br><br>Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.<br><br>Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".
