Description=An experimental platform/action game created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare #8. The competition's theme was 'swarms'.<br><br>The player controls a jetpack-equipped character, tasked with obtaining 25 'gadgets' from a space filled with floating, moving platforms. The player also has a laser gun that can be used to blast away certain destructible barriers. The challenge comes not from enemies (of which there are none), but from the random movement of the platforms themselves. If the player is not careful, s/he might end up crushed between them.<br><br>A handy radar in the top left of the screen keeps track of the gadgets' positions (though not the platforms they sit upon).<br><br>The game ends in one of two ways: With the player's messy death by squashing. Or with the successful collection of 25 gadgets, at which point a victory message will be displayed.

Description=Abandoned Bricks is a Tetris clone, offering several modes of play.<br><br>In every mode, play proceeds as usual in Tetris: blocks of varying shapes are dropped from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them so as to form complete horizontal lines, which then disappear from the screen.<br><br>In Classic mode, the goal is to clear a certain number of lines. When this goal is reached, the screen is cleared and the next level begins, requiring more lines be removed. The shapes drop more quickly as the game progresses, increasing as each line is cleared.<br><br>In Challenge mode, only two shapes are available for each level, but play proceeds otherwise as in classic mode.<br><br>In Bastet mode, play proceeds as in classic mode, but rather than the shapes being chosen at random, the AI chooses from among the least useful shapes, using the algorithm from Bastet version 0.41. Additionally, the next brick preview is unavailable in Bastet mode.<br><br>In addition to the single player modes, a two player Duel mode is available. In Duel mode, each player attempts to be the last one to survive. Besides the usual mechanics, there is one difference: when a player removes more than one line simultaneously, for each line he removes beyond the first, a line of 'junk' blocks appears at the bottom of his opponents screen.

Description=It is the unimaginably distant year 2009. You are Nick Vrenna, falsely locked inside a high security prison. The genetic experiments conducted in the prison, combined with a full-scale riot that took place recently, caused all guards and inmates to be transformed into insane, aggressive mutants. Your job is to escape while stopping the genetic plague from transforming the whole world. <br><br>Abuse is a side-scrolling platformer with a lot of shooting. It's a nonlinear game, as the levels often have a few exits that lead to different areas. Your character is a cyborg equipped with various weapons; initially, you only have a weak laser rifle with unlimited ammo, but you can find more powerful guns later on, such as grenade launchers, flamethrowers or lightsabers. You move through a building complex, fighting any enemies you might encounter on the way. The enemies are mostly the mutants, but also the defense systems (such as stationary missile launchers). <br><br>While you move with the keyboard, you can aim with your mouse, so you can shoot at any angle no matter what direction you are running. On your way, you'll find elevators, teleporters, cracked walls that can be destroyed and more. <br><br>Apart from ammo and health, you can also find upgrades which have a number of beneficial effect - increasing your running speed, for example.

There are different playing modes, most of them intended for games against other human players. But there is also an AI and a campaign mode.<br><br>The campaign mode against the AI helps new players get accustomed to the gameplay. It also introduces new units step by step - there are dozens of them - and ways of acquiring the three different resources crucial to success. These resources are sometimes injected automatically into the player's (or enemy's) industry, but sometimes they have to be transported to buildings, factories or hot spots by specialized supply and repair/refill units.<br>It goes without saying that intelligence gathering (or denying) and recon units also play very important role.<br><br>Like in the original Battle Isle series most units have more than one weapon system, but Advanced Strategic Command adds a slight touch of realism by applying the paper-stone-scissors principle to the combat mechanics. Besides their default damage, which is called punch here, weapons have certain modifiers which make them better against certain type of targets, e.g. a machine gun is good vs infantry but inadequate against armoured vehicles. Also some weapons are less effective against distant targets, but can be devastating at closer range.<br><br>The map editor can be used to create own maps.

Description=Aliens: The Roguelike is a tactical roguelike, inspired by the classic Aliens movie and the  Alien Breed: Tower Assault computer game.<br><br>The story is simple and traditional: in the year 2209, the colony Giger V sends out a distress call before stopping all communication. You are the fortunate soul who is to investigate this unexpected event. Unfortunately, your ship is shot down on approach; fortunately, you survive. Now enter the colony, stripped of your comrade and equipment, and go kick that alien queen's ass!<br><br>The game begins with character creation. Select one of five classes, like Marine, Scout, Medic etc. There are no attributes, instead, each class has different costs for improving the seven skills, three skills for handling weapons (sidearms, light or heavy weapons) and four others that improve your speed, reload time, throwing accuracy or the effect of medpacks. The final step before beginning your quest is to invest initial points in certain skills -- choose wisely!<br><br>You now start to explore the seven towers, each with several levels, to find the alien queen. You are only shown your immediate surroundings on the top-down map, and you have a limited view distance and can't look around corners, so you're in for some nasty surprises... the greenish text graphics and the ominous background music help to create this nice paranoid Aliens atmosphere.<br><br>Of course, you will encounter many aliens during the game -- juveniles, workers, warriors, and, who knows, maybe even the queen? Some of them are quite easy to kill, some of them harder, but none should be underestimated. They are not able to open doors, so closing in front of his ugly nose one can save your sorry life. <br><br>You will find weapons and ammunition, grenades, armor and medpacks to help you on your quest, but you will have to select your tactics carefully to survive: You can only carry one weapon of each type, as well as limited ammunition only. The weapons use different ammo and have different characteristics -- for example, shotguns are handy for blasting several enemies at once, but they are no good against armored targets.<br><br>You also should not forget to reload after each fight! Gameplay is entirely turn-based, yet, each action takes a different amount of time, so being able to reload faster or move quicker can make the difference between life and death -- so be sure to check the character screen to see if you have gained enough experience to increase one of the skills!

Description=And Yet It Moves is a platform game with puzzle elements where the goal is simply to complete each of the levels. The twist is that next to regular movement (left, right, jumping), the player is also able to rotate the game world in instances of ninety degrees, both left and right. That way, the environment can be explored in different directions. Even though it becomes possible to complete a level without the movement keys, it is mainly used for puzzles. Players need to take out enemies by moving items from the environment, guide a shadow character that mirror the player's actions, or do complex sets of platform jumping including bouncing ledges and swings. By quickly rotating, the velocity can be increased to dazzling speeds, but when the character hits the ground too fast or from too high a distance, he will be killed.<br><br>After every section there is a checkpoint and there is an unlimited amount of tries per level. The graphical style is envisioned as a world of paper cut-outs, in regard to the player's character as well as every item in the environment. There are also different themes for the levels, including fire, jungle and rocks. The game is divided into three main acts and an epilogue. Next to the main game mode, the levels can be played in competition for the fastest times, with global high score leaderboards as well as ghosts of other players.

Description=Armagetron Advanced is the sequel to Armagetron, and like it's predecessor is a 3D version of the "light cycles" sequence of TRON. Armagetron Advanced is played on a 3D view that can be rotated and by default is displayed from behind the player. The player's only controls are the ability to turn left, turn right and decelerate. As the player travels around the arena, the area behind them is filled with a solid "trail" which is indestructible. The goal of each game is to outmaneuver the opponents, causing them to crash into a trail or the area wall. Each opponent eliminated gives points to the player, while each death loses points. <br><br>While the core game follows above, Players can customize many variables of Armagetron Advanced including the size of the arena, number of opponents, opponent AI and length of the "trail" of each light cycle. Victory conditions can also be changed, allowing for an end goal of the first player to reach the "win zone" rather than destroy opponents. The game can be played online or offline with several players and individually or in team games.

Description=A Tale in the Desert is an massively multiplayer online roleplaying game with an ancient Egyptian setting. It has two main differences to other games in this genre: Firstly it abandoned fighting completely. The main focus of the game lies in the community and the mutual forming of a society. Secondly it has a limited run time, every few years a new "tale" starts which resets the game and brings new features.<br><br>Since grinding monsters is out of the question, the main occupation is crafting and the completion of several tests which are divided into seven categories: Architecture, Art, Body, Conflict (later replaced with Harmony), Leadership, Thought and Worship. The tests itself are varied, e.g. logic puzzles for Thought, finding a certain number of mushrooms for Body or building houses for Architecture. Every category starts with an easy quest as tutorial and ends with special challenges where many players have to work together.<br><br>Another important part of the game is research and development which are conducted in schools and universities. Like the tests these improvements are divided into the seven categories, e.g. Chemistry in Thought or mining in Architecture. Like in reality before an invention is made "public" the development costs time and resources in it. Later everyone can learn the techniques in schools. Other things have to be developed/learned by the players themselves, e.g. the optimal production of certain goods. <br><br>Another special feature of the game is the legal system which is basically done by the players themselves. The process is basically that one player starts a petition and gathers signatures. If he got enough there is a voting. When the proposal passes this step the game gets reprogrammed to enforce the law.

Description=This open-source, freeware remake of the Spanish action-adventure from 1984 replaces the characteristic large sprites of the ZX Spectrum graphics, and its sparse thin sounds, with new enhanced assets closer to the modern standards, while carefully maintaining the same style and gameplay of the original. As before, the player controls an archaeologist wandering through the gardens of an Arab palace, collecting keys and other useful objects to solve puzzles while avoiding roaming enemies like Moorish guards, giant crabs, poisonous spiders and other bizarre creatures. The adventurer carries a small amount of bombs that can be deployed to destroy all the foes on the screen. He has to drop the bomb and move to an adjacent screen, then return after the detonation. Otherwise, he can also be caught on the explosion and killed. The main objective is to navigate the maze-like environments to rescue a fellow prisoner, kidnap the princess and steal the royal treasure.

Description=Bang! Howdy is a 3D turn-based strategy game with a western theme and bright graphics reminiscent of certain Blizzard titles. Offering both singleplayer and multi-player options, the game consists of a number of scenarios in small areas with different themes and strategical goals. Players take turns commanding a small band of units (usually about four or five) with different statistics against up to three other (computer-controlled) players. Some of the scenarios are:<br><br>1. Claim Jumping: collect claim nuggets and defend or overtake claims.<br>2. Rustlin' Cattle: brand and re-brand cows.<br>3. Gold Rush: collect gold nuggets.<br>4. Land Grab: capture and defend a number of homesteads.<br><br>Using a 3d overhead view, players take turns moving around units such as flying blimps, gunslingers, big shot units, dirigibles, artillery, shotgunners, sharpshooters, steam gunmen and more. Each game consists of a set number of rounds. The scenarios' goals often involve acquiring and defending certain areas or items before time runs out. Units have different weapons, features and movement options. Clicking a unit reveals their health and the time before a next move is possible. Obstacles and elevation also influence units and some work better than others in specific situations.<br><br>Movement is done through a semi-transparent grid overlay that shows the movement or attack range. Big Shot units have the ability to capture homesteads, overtake claims and brand cows, and need to be protected well. When dead, units respawn but this takes a number of turns. Points are called "Scrip" and are awarded based on the outcome.<br><br>The gameplay is further influenced through spawning bonuses that improve defence, movement, attacking power, health or luck. This can also be done by collecting and using cards during gameplay, with similar effects. The single-player portion is played from a town where players can visit different buildings. The avatar can be fully customized and the scenarios are shown as a number of unlockable town bounties, rewarded with cash. There are also a number of most wanted challenges against a specific opponent. Multiplayer usually involved ranked matches.<br><br>Although the game is free to play, paying customers with a gold account receive more customization options (hats, clothes, facepaint), they can recruit new Big Shot units, visit new towns, and unlock new units and goods.

Description=Between is a disjunct cooperative multiplayer game by the art game developer Jason Rohrer. Unlike his previous games, there is no singleplayer element and it communicates through an online connection with another player. Players can choose to join a game with a stranger, or start a new match with a friend based on a "friends code" that is randomly generated by the player who starts the session.<br><br>As with all his games, no instructions are given and the gameplay is only revealed gradually. The game takes place in an abstract, side-scrolling world where a character can be controlled. In the distance, a shimmering image of a tower is shown. It consists of blocks, each with a different squared pattern of colours. The aim of the game is to build the tower according to the pattern, but it is impossible to complete it without the help of the other player who has the same goal, but who is not visible on the player's screen.<br><br>The game consists of three different states, and they can be chosen by going to sleep or waking up, represented by an area on each side of the screen. The player starts with an outlined construction area where the patterns of blocks can be selected and built, to be moved to the tower where they are stacked. The player however starts with three colours: red, green and blue, while higher parts of the tower with complex colours include cyan, magenta and blue. These block patterns cannot be built by the player, but need to be provided by the other player. The other one however does not sees the player's tower and as such the correct patterns are created by accident, or it may just as well never happen, leaving the player unable to complete the game.<br><br>When a part of the tower is completed, a soft sound can be heard. When the game is played by two players in the same room, this can serve as an additional hint for the other player, as the author discourages looking at another player's screen.

Description=Bullet Candy Perfect is a top-down bullet hell arena shooter. It is a remake of the original Bullet Candy using a 3D engine, but originally it was meant to become an unlockable in the game Irukandji. In the end the developer found it to be good enough to stand on its own and released it separately.<br><br>The game can be controlled using a gamepad or with the combination of a mouse and a keyboard. Players direct a space ship that can be moved around and can fire in any direction, regardless of the movement. The game consists of a series of enclosed, single-screen arenas where the successive waves of enemies and attack patterns become gradually more difficult. Next to a basic laser with an unlimited amount of bullets, the ship can pick up yellow power pods. These lead to new weaponry and higher scores. When half of the pods in a single level are collected, the laser is upgraded to a stronger version. When all of them are collected, a smart bomb is unleashed and it destroys all enemies at once.<br><br>While playing, and especially when destroying enemies, four types of bonus items appear. Red ones provide extra lives, yellow one yield more points, blue ones provide triple shots, and green ones make the ship invincible for a short while. Players are encouraged to survive as long as possible with a single life. Not only because all weapon upgrades are otherwise lost, but also because this resets the score multiplier at the bottom of the screen. In dangerous situations the player can opt to commit suicide instead of being shot, as that preserves the upgrades and multiplier. Committing suicide however costs two lives.<br><br>During attack waves the screen is generally crowded with many different enemies, bullets and bonuses, all in different shapes and colours. All objects need to be evaded successfully to survive and some enemies have complex attack patterns. When dying the ship immediately respawns and the gameplay is continued, without having to replay the entire wave. The game includes a high score list and keeps track of the overall progress. There is a basic tutorial and three difficulty levels. High difficulty levels do not only toughen up the game, they also provide multipliers that are two and three times as large, making them the modes where the highest amount of points can be scored.

The general interface looks similar, but new campaigns and features such as grenade exchanges have been added.<br><br>Each player joins a German or an American team and then controls four soldiers in a squad. With different squads per team controlled by different human players (up to 30 in a single game), the aim is to kill the soldiers on the other side, or to hold the most points in strategic points at the end of the round. Soldiers start with 5 grenades and basic rifles and on certain maps extra weapons such as machine guns, Thompsons / MP40s, ammo boxes or extra grenades are given to the Commanding Officer to assign. Each side has a Commanding Officer, an experienced player to give orders, manage the weapons and ammunition, and make tactical decisions.<br><br>Teams can then be split to cover different areas. The soldiers can crawl, hide, throw grenades, and there are different fire options. Combat happens in real-time, but is often based on stealth and the use of buildings and the environment for tactical play. Visibility is based on a logical line-of-sight system, and you can only see what your soldiers see.

Description=Captain 'S': The Remake is a freeware, open-source update to the classic platform game from Spain. As in the original, the player controls Mariano Lpez, a truck driver that crashed his vehicle after witnessing an atomic explosion. A spilled truckload of the blood sausages he was transporting ended up being irradiated by the fallout. Mariano wakes up hungry, and foolishly decides to try some of the glowing food, transforming into the superhero Captain 'S'. Now he must clear Seville of all the roaming mutations and fight their leader, the mad scientist Torrebruno.<br><br>In his normal state, Mariano can jump on platforms and punch enemies within reach, but is killed instantaneously when hit by objects dropped by the mutants or when touching one of the approaching foes. After collecting and gobbling up one of the radioactive sausages, he becomes the much more resilient and powerful Captain 'S'. The superhero can fly over short distances, and has three powers: a continuous puff that blows the monsters back, glowing sausages that can be throw at the enemy, and a radioactive shield that makes him invulnerable for a few seconds. His energy is show at the bottom, as a large red sausage meter that gets shorter with every hit, eventually disappearing with the character reverting to Mariano.<br><br>Besides the updated graphics and sound, the game changes some of the controls and behavior of the original as well, with Mariano's jumps and the Captain powers being more interactive and closer to modern standards. The levels were also expanded, with a much larger world map to explore in the second stage. The language can be set to English or Spanish, and the controls and level of graphic detail can be configured on the main menu, allowing a wide range of hardware to run the game.

He constructs buildings and production cycles to improve his economic strength and satisfy the population's wishes. Space ships can be built individually with different components. Sooner or later the player has to expand to get access to more resources, to do so he can either settle on new planets or trade with other players. <br><br>Of course he can also go to war: the combat is a simple matter of selecting a space ship and telling it what to attack.

Starting from a local BBS the player quickly gains the knowledge to exploit long distance calls, hack into protected environments and download updates and programs to expand the computer's capabilities. Although there are many technical elements to the story, romance in a digital world is a central theme and no technical knowledge is required to play  just the attention to important clues.<br><br>Much of the game takes place through messages. The player does not actively need to type these, replies are composed automatically and you can only guess at the content of the messages that are sent out based on other people's answers. The Amie Workbench comes with a basic interface with a programme to play music. Other ones are added later and all of them are accessed through the desktop.

Description=Dofus is a 2-D Flash-based tactical MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that uses cute manga-inspired graphics.  The humorous fantasy land of The World Of Twelve is like an interactive comic book.  6 dragon eggs named Dofus have disappeared in the province of Amakna and the greed of people to get their hands on the extraordinary powers they emit has resulted in people and cities coming to blows.  There are also strange occurrences such as weird animals appearing and even new lands rising from the sea.  <br><br>Servers exist for different language communities and there's a F2P account with access to the zone of Incarnam for new players and to the city of Astrub and most of its outlying areas.  A P2P account allows access to the whole world of Dofus, plus PVP factional battles and being able to go above level 30 in profession levels.  You control a character avatar from one of twelve classes (including Pandawa's Flask which are only available as P2P)  through the world in isometric view.  Your character gains levels through completing quests and defeating monsters.  Points are awarded to life, characteristic and spell levels.  You can take up a profession, join a group to attack a dungeon, or join a guild. <br><br>It has a PvP + PvE turn-based fighting system which allows for hundreds of tactical possibilities. When you attack a monster, you are transported to a copy map where no-one else can join and take turn using spells to either attack, buff, drain or heal Action Points or Movement Points.  There's 20 class spells plus some common weapon mastery, elemental or mount-taming spells that can be bought, exchanged for or looted from monsters.  Challenges are issued at the start of a  fight to perform certain limited moves and if players complete the challenge their reward is amplified.<br><br>You can learn up to 3 professions (in collecting, crafting or magus fields) and with enough experience you can gain specializations.  Also, you can align yourself with the warring factions of Bonta (City of Angels) or Brakmar (City of Demons) and wear a shield, and access exclusive areas and resources.    Bounties may sometimes be placed by a special NPC on a player of an opposing alignment.  Players who find and kill targets with a bounty get a reward of bonus experience points.  On some servers, players can take out contracts on others for which a mercenary alignment will take on those jobs.  Guilds can also be formed to allow players to speak and coordinate events, mark houses and paddocks with their insignia, and place perceptors on their maps to collect taxes from battles fought there.

The only way out is through. Equipped only with a pistol, you start to shoot your way through the mazes.<br><br>The whole game is text-only, but made in a Doom-like style (the sound effects in the Windows version are the original Doom sounds). The only difference to Doom is that you haven't got a realistic 3D world. What you've got are simple 2D text graphics, like in Rogue, where @ denotes the player character, letters denote monsters and other characters denote items.<br><br>Apart from the style, this game is a straight Rogue-like dungeon crawler. The gameplay is turn-based, with each action taking a certain amount of time. As in a role-playing game, the character has different stats that increase with his experience -- he can reload faster, do more damage, shoot more accurately etc. During the game, you find different weapons and power-ups, all well-known to doom players (blue sphere power-ups, green armor etc.).<br><br>The game is freeware and was written in FreePascal, using the Valkyrie library by the same developer.

Description=Droid Assault is an arcade shooter inspired by Paradroid and Quazatron, where the player controls a small army of robots invading an industrial complex and fighting against other malfunctioning machines. Each unit has its own energy meter, diminishing with every hit received, with the robot eventually exploding when all the reserves are spent. The objective of each level is to destroy all the enemy robots to activate a teleporter and exit to the next stage.<br><br>The main characteristic taken from those earlier games is the ability to connect the robots to one of the roaming foes, effectively taking control of the other machine and adding it to the army. The number of transfer points available is displayed at the bottom-right corner, with new ones received at every 1000 points. Larger robots require more transfer points to be transformed into a friendly unit, with the cost displayed on top of the machine when attempting a transfer. The robots recruited this way are carried from level to level, and the units can be upgraded with power-ups, new armor and more powerful weapons. The player can switch between any of the available robots with a button.<br><br>After reaching the limit of eight robots, new units acquired start to replace the older ones in the roster. Besides the robots patrolling the levels and shooting on sight, there are glowing mines set on the floor and stationary turrets that have to be avoided. Power-ups and upgrades appear after destroying some of the robots, or are retrieved after exploding crates. Final stages end with a boss fight against a large enemy moving and shooting in a set pattern.

The tanks are simple to control with a keyboard/mouse-combination but in other aspects, e.g. damage and weapon range, the game tries to be as realistic as possible.<br><br>The game features several different maps and mission goals but the basic principle is that a match has a fixed time frame, typically between 30 and 60 minutes, where the players battle each other and solve tasks like capturing the enemy flag or conquering a point on the map. Every successful action rewards points and in the end the team with the most points win. When a player dies he can set his respawn point. One player per team can play as commander and gives orders on the tactical map. The Ogre playing mode is a bit different because there one team consists of just one player who controls a giant tank.<br><br>The maps and objectives offer several different tactical approaches. One aspect of this are the various different tank models which can be chosen, For single players there are the possibilities to play single matches against bots in 20 scenarios and a campaign with ten missions in a linear order. The core gameplay doesn't change for these missions.

If this sounds familiar, it's no coincidence -- Zork/Dungeon is the primordial clay from which the first three games of the Zork series were fashioned, following some extensive refitting of set pieces -- due to the game's enormous size of one megabyte, making it commercially available for home microcomputers, with their limited memory and storage capabilities, was not considered a viable plan in 1979... until they came up with the idea of segmenting the giant dungeon up.<br><br>(Ports of this game also exist for VMS, the Acorn Archimedes, and the Z-code, TADS and GLK software platforms.)

In 2060 they enter space above their next target: Earth. The Global Defense Force (GDF) is completely overwhelmed by the attack of this highly advanced force but they don't give up and fight for their survival.

This means that on every map one team needs to fulfill an objective while the other needs to guard it. For example on the map "Valley" the GDF needs to build a bridge, then drive a MCP over the bridge to a nearby outpost, hack a Strogg-shield so that the MCP can fire a missile into the Strogg base so that the GDF can enter it and destroy a generator.<br><br>To make it even more complex, most objectives need to be completed by a specific class. On each side are five classes and each class has special abilities. The engineer for example can build the bridge on Valley, repair damaged vehicles or deploy identities while the Field Ops supports his teammates by handing out weapons and deploying artillery systems. Since the maps are all pretty big, you also have access to several kinds of vehicles ranging from little quadbikes to helicopters.<br><br>Unlike most multiplayer-games, the teams in Enemy Territory: Quake Wars don't just have a different skin but are actually completely asymmetrical balanced from classes over weapons to vehicles. This means that while both teams have a medic, they both function differently. The GDF medic for example behaves like every other medic by instant reviving his teammates but the Strogg technician needs a few seconds before his dead companion is alive again. To balance this out, the Strogg technician can turn dead GDF soldiers into spawn hosts. So if he dies, he respawns at such a host (if it hasn't been destroyed).

Description=FlipOut is a Breakout variant developed for the 2008 Assembly summer convention. The classic concept of bouncing a ball towards bricks to clear an entire area to win the level, with the bottom being an endless pit of death where the ball can disappear, has not changed. Instead, it has been remade into 3D, with a slightly slanted playfield affected by realistic physics. That means gravity needs to be taken into account and the ball does not travel at a consistent speed when launched.<br><br>Also, instead of merely bouncing the ball, the paddle consists of two sides that can be tilted to launch the ball towards the bricks, similar to the flippers in a pinball game. There are different levels to choose from and many power-ups that affect the ball, the paddle and the field's gravity. Some bricks are unbreakable or require multiple hits to destroy. Also, bricks do not simply disappear but they form debris that hinders the ball or prevents the power-ups from falling down.

An arch-nemesis is automatically generated at the start of the game. A series of set encounters with this nemesis are periodically spawned leading up to a final, dramatic encounter. Based on the outcome of this encounter you either win or lose the game.<br><br>The main focus of the game, however, is the mecha-vs-mecha battles. Each mecha can be reconfigured in multiple ways by installing different equipment and body parts. There are multiple movement modes, including walking, rolling, jumping or flying.

Combat is turn-based and takes place upon a grid as per other roguelikes. Lancemates are not controlled directly, but rather are governed by their own AI. Combat is triggered either by missions or random encounters. Some missions have set objectives, such as destroying a piece of equipment or protecting a convoy. Missions are granted by different factions and award varying amounts of money and "renown". Some missions allow you to salvage remains, which you can then use to outfit your mecha.

After creating a starting position, the player can watch the cells to see what they do, or interfere while the simulation is running to add or remove live cells.<br><br>Unlike many other simulations of the Game of Life, Golly features an unlimited-sized board, a built-in collection of 'patterns' of pre-arranged cells, and the ability to undo and redo steps. Golly also supports other rules than Conway's Game of Life, including sixteen built-in alternate sets of rules, and the ability to enter others.

Description=This remake of the Spanish platform game from 1987 updates the graphics, sounds, brick physics and controls, while remaining faithful to the original gameplay. As in the old game, the player controls a thief in his night job of stealing any valuables and money laying around unprotected. The game starts in a sewer hideout, from where he can travel to any part of the city by following the connected pipes of the plumbing system, and riding the service elevators to reach the streets.<br><br>The thief has only one weapon, clay bricks that can be thrown at any approaching enemy to knock them out. The strength of the throw can be adjusted by holding and releasing a button to fill the force meter at the bottom, making the brick bounce from walls and other surfaces before finally shattering on the ground. Money bags can be found on several locations, and the funds accumulated are used to purchase the required trade tools at the hardware store, where useful objects like drillers, spanners, keys and other helpful items can be acquired to help complete the bank robbery.<br><br>The city is populated by bizarre cartoon characters that roam the town, hitting or holding the main character and removing some of his health energy. He can recover the lost energy by drinking the foaming beer glasses scattered around the levels. The thief carries a ladder that can be deployed anywhere to reach high places. The character dies instantaneously when walking over certain hazardous environments, like lakes and cement mixture barrels. The game language can be set to English or Spanish.

Description=As with Jason Rohrer's previous game Passage, Gravitation is an autobiographical game and it has a similar visual style. No explanation of the goal or the game mechanics is given and just like Rob Humble's art games a large part of the appeal is in discovering the gameplay. As such, the rest of the description below can be considered a spoiler and should not be read before first playing the game.<br><br>Gravitation is played as a metaphor of how the protagonist's moods and creative endeavors affect his family and vice versa. The player controls a bitmapped character in an environment that can only be explored vertically. The only other character is a small boy, Rohrer's son Mez. A single gameplay session consists of eight minutes with a clock counting down the seconds. By climbing platforms, the player collects blue stars (prizes) that drop down to the lowest level. As soon as they hit the ground, a number appears on them, counting down from nine to one. To collect the points, the blocks need to be pushed into a fireplace, but if the player stacks too many before coming back down, it becomes hard to move them around. Collecting the stars is not a goal by itself, the player can choose to play with Mez all the time and not achieve anything else, or go for the stars with the chance of having Mez disappear.<br><br>Mez is on the lowest level and he throws a ball the protagonist can return. This clears up the sky (and the character's mind) and allows the main character to jump and reach higher areas. At the same time, the frame size grows. When staying up the higher levels too long, Mez will disappear, leaving behind the red ball, most likely as an affirmation of the player's greed or neglect. It is not possible to collect all stars at once, grab all of them, or reach the top of the level. After a while, the frame size shrinks again, the environment turns cold and the main character can barely jump. This can be restored by returning to the lowest level, pushing stars into the fire or by playing with Mez. The entire sky also clears up when flames come out of the player's head, possibly referring to a manic or mad state, providing a short burst of motivation before eventually returning to depression.

You can also find different gems that give life or mana and potions that help jump higher, fall slower. Mana is needed for spells that you can aquire from level bosses.

Description=IQ Game is a simple strategy game that aims to improve the player's IQ. It is played on a field filled with blocks of different colours in random patterns. The player and the computer-controlled opponent alternately pick a block with a certain colour, adjacent to its own position. When the player selects one, that block and all other blocks of the same colour, adjacent to any of the player's blocks, become taken.<br><br>The trick is into thinking forward and choosing blocks that will expand the reach as quickly as possible. However, the same colour can never be picked in succession (if the opponent chose it first for example), widening the strategical options. The computer's AI supports two algorithms: Pinky, a well-known greedy algorithm with 50% probability of error, and Brain, like Pinky but no errors in greedy, plus it tries to block player's best move. The player with the largest reach wins the game.

Description=Irukandji is a vertically scrolling bullet shooter set in an abstract underwater trench. The player controls a ship battling waves of procedurally generated sea monsters, leading up to the final confrontation with a giant sea crab. The game consists of only a single level, but after each successful playthrough a new ship is unlocked, with six available in total.<br><br>Each ship has different characteristics based on weapon strength, speed and the power of the special weapon, a depletable super weapon different for each ship. The most important difference between the ships is the shooting pattern; some only shoot in straight vertical lines, while others have bullets swirl to the sides. For the first ship Particle Bird for instance, there are two keys: one directs bullets to the left, the other to the right, and when pressed together they form a straight, vertical stream.<br><br>While playing defeated enemies leave behind weapon upgrades that also act as the main energy source. When hit, some of the upgrades are lost, until the ship is entirely destroyed. Other collectibles are score multipliers. Not all special weapons are offensive, one ship for instance is also able to generate a temporary shield to block incoming attacks. The game contains a global ranking and a list of achievements.

Description=The evil Dr. T has invented tea-eating plants that he uses to destroy the tea-plantations of the British Empire in order to force them to buy their tea from him. Of course the Queen does not want his tea so she sends in a British Secret Agent who has to stop Dr. T.  Jack Keane, a rather unsuccessful captain, is chosen to escort the agent to Tooth Island where Dr. T has his base of operations. When he meets the agent in Cape Town it quickly becomes clear that the agent does not really know anything about spying even though he thinks he is the best of the best. So Jack unwillingly takes over the operation and tries to help the agent stop Dr. T.<br><br>Players take the role of Jack in 3rd person perspective. Later in the game the player can also control Amanda, an American henchman who is hired by Dr. T to get rid of Jack. Amanda eventually learns she is on the wrong side and begins helping Jack instead.<br><br>This adventure game uses a 3D engine with a fixed camera and everything is controlled by the mouse. The left mouse button is used mostly for looking at objects and moving around the gameplay screen, while the the right button performs all important actions.<br><br>Upon hovering over items, the appropriate action appears: walking, running, looking, picking up, talking or using. Items are gathered in the inventory at the top of the screen. They can be examined, used in the environment or combined to create a new item. There are also bonus items available when certain non-essential actions are completed. These have nothing to do with the main story but provide bonus riddles. There is another bonus if certain riddles are completed early before they stop the game's progress.<br><br>Other options offered in the game include using the "x" keyboard key to highlight all interactive spots in the current view, turning subtitles on or off, inventory show or hide, and various screen resolution settings. The playable character will run if the left-mouse button is double-clicked.<br><br>The story-based problems all involve choosing the proper inventory item (or combination of items) in the environment or on another character. There are no puzzles as such otherwise. Climbing up and down and occasional jumping are done with a click of the mouse, but there is no time-limit or risk, since your character cannot die in the game.<br><br>The graphics and humour are reminiscent of the LucasArts adventures especially the Monkey Island series.

Description=The political situation in the Democratic Monarchy island of Arulco has gone from bad to nightmare. The country has been taken over through a coup-de-tat by Queen Deidranna Reitman, the wife of Enrico Chivaldori - rightful heir and son of late King Andreas Chivaldori. Enrico was reportedly killed in an assassination attempt during his trial for the murder of his father. Enrico however is alive and has contacted The Association of International Mercenaries (A.I.M.) to help him retake the island. Making contact with Miguel Cordoba, the head of the resistance team, A.I.M. will hire mercenaries and coordinate battle plans to control towns, organize militias in a quest to overthrow Queen Deidranna.<br><br>Jagged Alliance 2 is an isometric, 3rd-person perspective turned-based strategy game.

From a new game, players will use their laptop to review information and hire mercenaries. Following that, the Political map shows a satellite top-down position of the island of Arulco. From the map, equipment and funds are managed, as well as a review of enemy movement, and planning can be made to capture towns, mines and other locations. From the map, mercenaries can be deployed into a specific sector. Hostile sectors and enemy counter-attacks initiate combat mode<br><br>The combat screen is where most of the actual gameplay occurs. Traveling in towns, exploring houses (with the purpose of stealing stuff of course!) and most importantly combat, occurs here. An encounter with an enemy team (either offensive or defensive) will prompt a battle in the area of contact. If on the offensive, players may opt to place mercenaries in favorable positions. Each team plays in turns, unless their action in interrupted by an opposing member. Enemies come in all shapes and sizes: Enemy soldiers, tanks, bloodcats, and (in Sci-fi mode) very weird insect-like monsters. The team that remains alive will control the sector.<br><br>In order to recapture the island, players must engage in town militia management. A defense system must be organized for newly conquered towns to defend against enemy troops. Only loyal towns however may have its population trained into militia (indicated by a green percentage on the town via political map). A maximum of 2 mercenaries may train militia in any given town. The militia has 3 different training levels: Green, Regular, and Veteran. The first 2 may be acquired through training, while the Veteran status may only be acquired through combat.

Your characters gain skills with use, capped by their original stats.  Increasing one's original stats can only be accomplished by getting more "juice" points, the LCS version of experience, which is mostly acquired by violence and criminal behavior.<br><br>All of this is decidedly tongue-in-cheek, and neither of the warring ideologies receives any quarter from the game's biting satire.  Thus both liberals and conservatives can enjoy the game, despite the former being the protagonists, as no position on the political compass is safe from the radicalizing bludgeon-like absurdity that prevails throughout.<br><br>The player's over-the-top actions can influence public opinion and elections, cause violent police/military crackdowns, result in dramatic trials, prison escapes, etc., generating an almost limitless cavalcade of dramatic events.  Policy changes regularly via Congressional votes, public referenda and Supreme Court decisions, and these changes influence the game world directly in terms of what is legal and what is popular.<br><br>The ultimate goal is to turn the country "Elite Liberal," which requires policy shift on an extremely broad range of issues and extensive liberal domination of government.  This naturally requires the Supreme Court, a body which can take many in-game years to turn fully liberal due to its potentially life-long terms of service.<br><br>The core game was brought to its final state via Bay 12 Games' development, but it has been altered well past this version through the release of its source to fans.  The fan additions are officially sanctioned and can be found on the Bay 12 Games Forums, Jonathan S. Fox being the current guiding force behind them.

His name is Turner, his wife has been killed and his only son kidnapped by a band of rogue raiders. At first, the task seems clear, however soon a tangled up conspiracy begins to unravel itself. The brave kung-fu rabbit will have to face wolves, bandits and even treacherous friends to fully understand what exactly is going on.<br><br>The prominent feature of Lugaru is a unique combat system that takes advantage of skeleton animation in mix with rag-doll physics. The players will have access to various actions at their disposal, each one resulting in different move depending on the context in which the action was performed. The list include simple attacks, attack reversals, counter-reversals, long-range knife attack and a strong rabbit kick. Sometimes, it stands to reason to remain undetected and sneak up on the enemies from behind taking them out one by one. As the game progress additional weapons become available, like sword or staff, each one with the techniques of their own.

Description=Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure set in a mechanical world where the player controls a small robot that has been kicked out of the city. He has to return and confront the Black Cap Brotherhood who terrorizes his kind and took away his girlfriend. The game consists of a number of static, non-scrolling screens the player gets to explore. This is done by clicking on objects in the environment to manipulate them, gathering them in an inventory and solving a wide array of puzzles, ranging from simple item combinations to more complex pattern analysis. The player's robot can scale his height to solve a number of problems, and communication is often presented graphically through speech bubbles that describe a scene using animated images, rather than words.<br><br>It is not possible to die, and when stuck, the player can opt to use a single hint (one per screen) or consult a walkthrough book. Pages in this book show the full solution to the level in the form of concept art panels, but to reach it a short side-scrolling shooter mini-game needs to be played. Therefore, the player cannot access it right away. In the beginning progress is done screen by screen, but after a while the world opens up more with many locations available at the same time.

Uzume, a mysterious summoner;<br><br>and you, an urchin with a handful of cantrips to help survive the streets at night, visiting in hopes of learning a thing or two about magic use by observing the proceedings -- but accidentally, and terrifyingly, thrown into the competition unarmed and outclassed.  To survive, you need to somehow win the competition.<br><br>An unusually MUD-like entry in the 2004 IF Compo (placing 18th), this game pits the player against an array of stronger opponents in an enclosed castle complex, all interacted with through a robust TADS text adventure interface.  Since the emphasis is on survival, not storytelling, descriptions and character interactions are terse and to-the-point -- more Colossal Cave than Zork, with a generous helping of Legend of the Red Dragon mellowing the difference.<br><br>A winning strategy involves thorough exploration of the environment, scavenging arcane knowledge and artifacts from the grimoires of adversaries slain by other competitors, and having the dumb luck to be in the right place at the right time to do so. By the end of the game you should have tamed the denizens of the castle's dungeon, mastered the respective sorcerous schools of all your ex-rivals, brought life to inanimate objects and brought back from the dead extinct monsters to do your bidding -- leaving you in a position for kingship to seem a far more plausible possibility than when you started.  But to get there, you're going to have to tread lightly and do a heckuva lot of hackenslash RPG-style stat-building.

Description=Minecraft is a game which mixes elements of sandbox, survival horror and construction game. It is an evolved version of Minecraft Classic<br><br>As in Minecraft Classic the player is dropped in a randomly generated world made out of cubes. Unlike the classic version where the player can add and remove blocks at will, in this version all blocks the player wants to place must first be "mined" elsewhere. Some materials require special equipment to be mined. Stone requires a wooden pick axe to be mined; gold requires an iron pick axe and obsidian requires a diamond pick axe. The player can also create shovels and normal axes to mine sand, dirt and wood faster. Mining is no longer instant but requires the player to hit the block a couple times, tools reduce the time.<br><br>Some blocks can not be found in nature but require crafting. Clay, for example, can be split into clay balls, which when baked turn into bricks which can be combined to form brick wall blocks. Baking happens in a stone oven, which requires a steady supply of coal and the oven itself needs to be crafted at a workbench, which needs to be constructed first.<br><br>This time the player(s) are not alone. During the day pigs, chickens, cows and sheep roam the land. Some of them, when killed or struck, will drop valuable items such as leather required for protective clothing or pork chops which when baked can heal the player. But at night and in the dark randomly generated caverns monsters rule the land. There are various different monsters, including the zombie, a skeleton archer, an exploding creeper, deadly spiders and gelatinous cubes. Aside from randomly spawning in dark areas, they also spawn in so-called "mob spawners" which spawn enemies indefinitely until properly illuminated or destroyed. To defend himself against enemies the player can craft weapons such as a sword and bow, and protective clothing to reduce damage. When the player dies his items are dropped at the place of his death, but the player respawns at his original spawn point. Items can be recovered if the player reaches them within five minutes (unless they fell into lava).<br><br>The randomly generated worlds are structured in such a fashion that more valuable resources are either rare or only spawn in deep caverns far below the ground.<br><br>Aside from building blocks the game also, unlike its previous versions, offers more complex building. The player can create railway systems and ride mine carts, row in a small boat, and build pressure plates, switches, doors and electrical circuits to power various contraptions.<br><br>The game features no pre-set goals and advocates exploration and construction.

Description=Visually very similar to the Sim City series, Mobility also allows the player to control and dictate the growth of a city, but the main focus of the game is other: public transportation.<br><br>While the player is in charge of developing an empty plot of land like in SimCity 2000, by "zoning" areas to residential, commercial and industrial buildings in different densities, as well as services such as malls, schools and several entertainment facilities, the true goal of the game is assuring all citizens can move from their homes to their jobs, commercial and entertainment buildings without stressing in traffic jams or overpolluting the area, lowering the quality of life of those living next to busy streets. For that, the player can setup traffic signs, define maximum road speeds and priorities at crossings, create an efficient network of public transportation buses, and at more advanced levels, urban railroads and several commodities such as parking spots, active navigation and "park and ride" systems. <br><br>Research also plays a part in the game. Long-term projects of emissions reduction, fuel consumption efficiency, electric and hydrogen vehicles and teleworking all affect the city efficiency and quality of life of your citizens. As the goal is to keep a large city with as little people driving and polluting as possible, by adjusting traffic fines and taxes (providing bonuses to drivers of minicars, for instance) and rewarding those who renounce their car, work at home or decide on a non-fossil fuel powered car by giving them a lower tax burden.<br><br>There are two game modes: Normal and Master Mode, where the player is free to develop the city even if it went into debt or features poor evaluations. In this mode, simulations settings can also be tweaked to study the effect of them in the map. Some scenarios where the player has to solve issues in a city are also included.

Player input is limited to clicking on the lines, which removes them, allowing adjacent squares to swell in all directions until either touching another black line, which halts growth, touching another square of the same colour, which clears both squares from the screen (and is the level's objective), or touching another square of a different colour, which renders both squares grey and the level unwinnable.<br><br>Upon matching all squares, a new level with a more complicated arrangement is revealed, a process which continues through ten levels.  Gameplay is also complicated by the advanced move achieved by clicking on the intersection of two black lines, which removes both lines involved and generally contributes to rapid and unpredictable change to the layout of the screen.  Square growth and contact is accompanied by a harmonious abstract soundscape directly informed by movement on the screen.

Description=NetHack is a text-only (although some graphical versions exist) roguelike role-playing game. The objective is to find the Amulet of Yendor and sacrifice it to your deity. <br><br>In the beginning, you choose one of the classes - there are some traditional ones, like Priest or Knight, but also unusual ones like Tourist or Caveman. Then, you find yourself on the 1st level of the dungeon, along with your pet that will accompany you and help you in combat. On each level, you have to find an exit to the lower level; on the way, you'll find countless monsters to fight, as well as items to collect. Sometimes, you come upon a shop, where you can buy or sell items. <br><br>Items you find can be blessed (more effective than normal), but sometimes are cursed (less effective, or outright harmful). Eating the corpses of fallen enemies is an important part of the game, since many creatures give you special abilities or immunities when eaten. <br><br>While the above description might seem brief, NetHack is, in fact, a very complex and merciless game - there are lots of ways to die. <br><br>Since NetHack is a roguelike, everything is represented as a top-down view of the current dungeon level, where the walls, the floor, and all items, characters and monsters are ASCII characters.

The game remains the same basic strategy title, where the goal is to build lots of autonomous robots to destroy the opponent's machines and resources. The player controls a hovering aircraft that acts as a cursor, moving it around the map to show all the available installations and buildings, where machines are constructed and raw materials are harvested. Construction buildings have landing pads that open up menus with options.<br><br>A mini-map at the bottom shows the whole extension of the map, with blinking dots pinpointing the relative positions of the ship and the robots. When placing the aircraft on a factory, the construction menu appears where robots can be assembled from several different pieces, to give them singular abilities and weapons. The robots can be ordered about by landing on their heads, and choosing one of the options from a list of commands. The main objective is to send the robot army to take over the factories of the enemy and eliminate the opposing units. Besides recreating the default map, several new ones are included as well, some much more complex than the old, primitive original.

Unlike most add-ons, this expansion doesn't extend the first game. It is an entirely new campaign in which players can start a brand new character or load up a previously saved NWN character.<br><br>The story begins in Master Drogan's School for Heroes amidst the snowy mountains in the northern portion of the Forgotten Realms. Your studies finished, you and several other adventurers are just about to graduate. As you walk toward the main hall, havoc ensues as a band of kobolds attacks, stealing four magical artifacts and seriously injuring Master Drogan, who is unconscious. You are sent out into the world to find a special healing potion for Drogan and to recover the stolen artifacts. Your travels will take you deep into the Nether Mountains, the Anauroch Desert with a caravan of halfling gypsies, and high above the earth inside the flying city of Undrentide. <br><br>The game is divided into 3 Sections comprised of Chapter 1, the Interlude and Chapter 2, and gameplay does not differ from the original game with the same engine and interface throughout. But there is more interaction with your "henchmen" companions in this expansion.<br><br>At first, you can choose between 2 companions to accompany you: the self-righteous, half-orc sorcerer Xanos or Dorna Trapspringer, a dwarven rogue-cleric. Later on you can choose Deekin, a kobold Bard. Each one has a unique personality, attributes and abilities which you can access by talking to them or selecting it. For instance, talk to Dorna and ask her to cast one of her cleric spells. If they have double classes (as is the case with Dorna), you can tell them to "train up" in just one or both of them as they increase in levels. <br><br>The ability to view and manipulate your henchman's inventory is new, allowing you to equip them and load them down with objects as you see fit.<br><br>When you have advanced higher in experience, you can choose one of the 5 new Prestige classes, or continue on with your current class. The new Prestige Classes are:<br><br>1. Assassin (Stealthy, back-stabbing attacker)<br>2. Arcane Archer (Spell-casting Ranger with special ranged attack abilities)<br>3. Blackguard (Evil Warrior, absolute opposite of a Paladin)<br>4. Harper Scout (Stealthy Rogue/Ranger)<br>5. Shadow Dancer (Evasive and stealthy Magic user)<br><br>Your character can be played in the single-player game as well as in the multiplayer online world. If you are into making MODs or being a Virtual Dungeon Master, Shadows of Undrentide adds more goodies to play with.

Description=Osmos is a game where the player controls a substance in an enclosed environment, reminiscent of flOw. By touching smaller objects, they can be absorbed, merging to create a larger substance. The substance is controlled through the mouse with a mechanism similar to the classic Asteroids. The mouse is used to choose a direction and gentle clicks, or holding the mouse button, provide acceleration in short bursts, steadily moving the object in a certain direction until touching a border or being slowed down by another object. Moving however causes to leave behind small droplets of fluid, rendering it smaller. When touching an object larger than itself, the player's substance gets absorbed.<br><br>The levels are set in enclosed environments where zooming can be done freely. After a few tutorials levels, different paths are offered based on variations on the concept. Some of them are based on aggressively tracking another organism or surviving in a crowded environment, another set is about an orbital course floating around a large object, and the final one is the slowest where there is very little space and the area needs to be captured with caution. In levels with limited manoeuvrability, time can be speed up or slowed down to prevent losing too much fluid when going slowly. Levels are usually won by capturing a specific organism (there are many, with different abilities) or growing to a certain size. In later levels antimatter is introduced, with the opposite effect or regular organisms.<br><br>The gameplay is supported by soothing, ambient electronic music.

Description=Black Plague is the second major part of what was originally planned as the Penumbra trilogy. The story is picked up right after the events of the first game, where Philip travelled to Greenland to pursue a location the notes of his father describe. The game takes off deep inside the mines, in a complex known as The Shelter, built in the seventies by the Archaic Elevated Castle, an organization in pursuit of ancient knowledge. Philip gets to know more about the Tuurngait virus and the storyline is explained further through the events and notes left behind.<br><br>Gameplay is fairly identical to the original game. Philip has to gain access to different locations mostly by relying on his wit, in a survival horror setting. The environment is very dark and puzzles are more complex than similar games, requiring extensive object manipulation, combined with a realistic physics engine where the mouse is used to open drawers, turn valves on tools and throw or stack objects. As the original game was often criticized for the cumbersome close-combat, the sequel removes almost all offensive means, having the player use the environment to outwit enemies and run from them, and putting the focus almost entirely on the puzzle-solving aspect. Gameplay is also largely based on stealth and hiding in dark corners. The game is shown through a first-person perspective with a regular mode, and an interact mode to explore specific areas.<br><br>Important items are stored in an inventory, with quick slots. The player can take multiple hits and restore health through painkillers. The game uses fixed save points, represented as ancient objects. Where the first game introduced the character Red as a dubious radio sidekick, the second game makes interaction more complex, as Philip is contact with a certain Dr. Amabel Swanson as well as with Clarence, a conflicting voice inside his head as a second personality due to the effects of an infection. Clarence is able to cause effects such as dj vus (playable sequences), distorted reality and a lack of control over vision and movement.<br><br>Playing the first game is not required to follow the story, but many important plot elements are further explained or referenced. New to this game are a gas mask, the use of computer terminals to access information and gain access to new areas, and an additional button to rotate items more easily when holding them.

Description=Penumbra: Overture is a first-person survival horror game. Originally created as a tech demo to showcase the in-house developed HPL engine, the small team soon turned it into a full game, split up into two episodes (originally advertised as three), of which this is the first one.<br><br>Players take on the role of Philip. After his mother's death, he receives a letter of his father, a man he has never seen in his life and presumed dead. Philip is asked to destroy a set of notes, but instead he decides to travel to the wastelands of Greenland following the clues left in the writings. He ends up in an underground complex where he discovers disturbing facts about the past and events hidden from the rest of the world.<br><br>Unlike other survival horror games, Penumbra heavily focuses on adventure elements with physics-based and inventory-based puzzles, exploration, and a few action elements and scripted sequences, with a first-person perspective and mechanics similar to a first-person shooter. Players need to use the environment to operate items and machines, and build structures with items scattered around. Almost any item can be picked up and used as an active game element. Actions need to be performed through an appropriate motion with the mouse: hold and move left or right to swing a weapon, turn valves in a circular motion, pull back to open drawers and doors, etc.<br><br>Key items are stored in an inventory and need to be combined or used with objects to progress in the game. Clues and background information about the events are gathered through notes left behind and one-way conversations with a mysterious man called Red. Puzzles often require a lot of thinking, with both visual and auditive elements, and need thorough investigation of the environment. All notes are stored in a notebook and clues for puzzles and tasks are added a to do list.<br><br>Philip can collect weapons such as a hammer, a broom and a pick axe, but melee fighting is generally discouraged and rarely rewarded. Instead, players need to use the environment to set up inventive traps or avoid fighting altogether by using distractions or stealth to sneak past enemies. By hiding in the shadows, the edge of the screen turns blue and Philip stays hidden for all creatures. The environment is almost completely dark at all times, enhancing the horror experience. Light sources are very important, and Philip only has a flashlight with a limited amount of batteries, a glowstick and flares.<br><br>Next to a constant feeling of desolation, there are many disturbing events and horrifying elements, so the faint of heart need not apply. The game supports OpenAL sound.

Each location is connected to the other one through a portal and there is nothing else linking them in a logical sequence. The puzzles are all physics based and require the player to examine the environment, manipulate it and usually find a way to power the portal to move on to the next area. Often, the player will need to buy structures with elements from the surroundings to reach other areas.<br><br>Story elements are provided through narrated sequences through diaries discovered in the areas. Each of the nine locations also contains a hidden artifact. When all nine of them are collected, the ending is expanded with additional pieces of information.

Description=Saving a failing restaurant may sound like a peculiar premise for a game, but any skepticism is forgotten at this diversion's base recipe for its salvation: to raise enough capital ($5 million) to purchase Flaming Sheinen's grill outright, you must take to the streets and delegate the revenue-generation to a small army of ladies of the night, who you will manage toward optimal profitability.  While it's a strange formula it's also a straightforward one (as the game reminds upon startup, Note: Daily Profit = Cash + (Rate * Hours of all Whores) -- and it can't be denied that this game's lurid approach to supply-side economics is more titillating than your run-of-the-mill industry simulator.<br><br>Starting at the nowheresville intersection of 1st & Main, you slowly build your empire, day by day, as you earn enough money to move uptown street by street, where your whores -- if suitably attired -- can increase their hourly rates by leaps and bounds (for after all, as the old chestnut has it, while lower-class whores get crabs, upper-class whores get nothing but lobster.)  While your player doesn't make money the same way as his stable does, you still have the options of attempting to fatten your chequebook by trips to the casino or, for the bold, outright theft from other players.<br><br>Indeed, left to your own devices, winning this game would only be a matter of time -- but the presence of competitors in this game's dial-up BBS door game context means that you not only have to perform well but outperform your peers, or risk having the restaurant sold out from under you.  This leads to a number of underhanded and despicable tactics -- you can burn down competing brothels, or hire an agent to impregnate or infect an opponent's working girls with venereal diseases... if you can't just persuade them to work for you instead, with a fancier wardrobe on a more prestigious corner.  (Just make sure you dole them out enough condoms to remain part of your active workforce!)<br><br>The interface is a series of single-keystroke options selected from various textmode menus, with every action undertaken adding minutes to the clock.  Once you hit late night, all you can do is sit back and wait for your employees to earn their commission.  The following day, you get to find out what all your careful arrangements (and more to the point, what the other players' careful arrangements against you) amounted to.

Could there be some connection between Postal Dude's visions, the evil video game publisher Whiptail Interactive, the recent mysterious mad-cow induced zombie outbreak, and the U.S. War on Terror? Has Postal Dude's brain trauma given him the ability to see the hidden machinations of some bovine Ultimate Evil attempting to bring about the very End of the World? Or is it just a bunch of random elements some pea-brained level designers strung together on a shoe-string budget? Only the Postal Dude can find the truth.<br><br>Apocalypse Weekend is the single player expansion pack for the controversial first-person murder simulator, Postal 2.

Apocalypse Weekend is also much more combat-oriented than the original Postal 2, and unlike Postal 2 it is virtually impossible to complete the game without killing, as several of the game's later missions involve the Postal Dude running through narrow corridors while being bombarded by wave after wave of hostile machine-gun-wielding attackers.<br><br>Apocalypse Weekend features:<br>10 new "story-based" missions taking place across 20 new maps over the course of 2 days (Saturday and Sunday), culminating in a climactic battle for the very fate of humanity (aka an oddly out-of-place boss battle that even the game admits was apparently thrown in just for the heck of it).<br><br>3 new melee weapons: A machete, a sledgehammer, and a scythe, all of which are capable of killing enemies in a single hit and even of severing limbs and cutting enemies in half.<br><br>Several new enemies, including: Experimental Tazmanian Devil cats, homicidal Gary Coleman demons, and the ubiquitous Mad Cow Tourette zombies. <br><br>A new damage modeling system that allows you to dismember your enemies by hacking off their arms and legs.

They are transported into The Sphere, an enormous, organic alien ship. Tommy is set free by one of the denizens and his task is to save his girlfriend Jen and grandfather Enisi, and find out what the meaning of The Sphere is.<br><br>This 3D-shooter, based on a modified version of the Doom 3 engine, takes place entirely inside the gigantic ship.

The ghost-like hawk Talon is always on your side and you sometimes cross over to another land to get help from your grandfather. Tommy can also shift to Spirit Walk, an alternate dimension in the game to get past obstacles and solve puzzles. When you die, you are also transported to another realm where you have to shoot lost souls with your spirit bow before being sent back. Your new health and spirit status will be based on your performance there.<br><br>The weapons Tommy uses are usually organic, with secondary fire functions. The arsenal includes a wrench, a rifle, crawlers, an acid sprayer, an auto cannon, a leech gun (chargeable with fire, ice, red orbs or lightning), a rocket launcher and the spirit bow. Certain parts of the game require you to explore large areas in a flying pod. You can use it to engage enemies or use the tractor beam to move objects. Navigation, often with a distinct lack of direction, is reminiscent of Descent then. Puzzles usually require you to decipher codes, activate switches and find entrances.<br><br>The game supports OpenAL and EAX HD surround sound, and multiplayer games for up to eight players in duel or team deathmatch. Although the game is developed by Human Head Studios, it is produced and was originally designed by 3D Realms.

Description=Primrose is a puzzle game played on a square grid of 49 tiles.<br><br>Each turn the player is presented a pair of tiles with two colours, initially from a pool of three colours. The player clicks the grid to place the first tile and then the second tile needs to go in the same row or column. The goal is to clear tiles by surrounding one or more tiles of a single colour entirely (horizontally and vertically) with tiles of a different colour. The edges of the grid can be used as well. Cleared titles are turned black and can be used again. The surrounding tiles are converted to the colour of the tiles that were cleared.<br><br>Clearing a large group of tiles also provides more points. After reaching a certain score up to four additional colours become available. Scores can be uploaded to an online leaderboard and there is also a colourblind mode.

However, obstacles such as crates, barrels, gates, magnets, pulleys, trampolines, and Rage-Bots will make the exit difficult to reach!  Three different platform types also add to the puzzles: Grass, sand, and ice.  On grass, objects such as crates and barrels can be pushed freely. On sand, they'll get stuck or move more slowly. On ice, the professor will keep sliding until he hits something and comes to a stop.<br><br>Navigating the levels is challenging, but you're often given power-ups to help you on your way. The Frost Gun, for example, will allow you to freeze any object (including the Rage-Bots!) so that the object can slide more easily on grass and sand.  The E.M.P. power-up is helpful for disabling Rage-Bots, and for disconnecting magnets.

Description=In what some might dub the logical conclusion of the statbuilding RPG genre, Progress Quest is a game that plays itself.  Stripping away the flashy and distracting bells and whistles of things like graphics and sound, automated gameplay consists of three simple phases, stock components of any game in its genre: 1) going into the killing fields to slay monsters; 2) returning to town to sell plunder looted from the monsters' corpses; and 3) using the resultant lucre to upgrade one's equipment, so as to more effectively facilitate the efficient slaughter of further monsters.  Abstracting things away from even a nominal Nethackian 2D textmode depiction, Progress Quest instead represents all these goings-on as a series of progress bars, gradually but irrevocably filling up until they tick over and place checkmarks in task boxes.<br><br>Effectively a monotonous, game-themed screen saver with all the excitement of watching your hard drive defragment, developer Grumdrig has nonetheless instilled a great deal of subtle complexity into this title, it randomly generating enough missions of common types (Deliver, Seek, Exterminate, Placate) to keep the avatar diligently questing while the player eats, sleeps, or works, occasionally checking in to monitor the "fire-and-forget" game's progress.  An impressive array of creative spell, treasure and equipment types await the stalwart player willing to invest the CPU cycles needed for the long haul -- as with Kingdom of Loathing, the pseudofantasy proceedings are tempered with a certain quantity of whimsy (available races, for instance, including the Panda Man, Land Squid and Enchanted Motorcycle, while class types include Puma Burgular, Tickle-Mimic and Tongueblade).

Description=An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.<br><br>id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.<br><br>In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.<br><br>Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.<br><br>The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.<br><br>Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

Description=Quake 4 is the true sequel to Quake II, continuing the Strogg vs. Humans storyline from the point where Quake II ended. The Strogg is an alien cyborg race which, much like the Star Trek Borg race from which they seem to be partly inspired, wander the galaxy conquering planets and wiping civilizations. Their sole purpose is to collect organic body parts with which to swell their ranks. After a prolonged war, the united armed forces of Earth decided to launch a desperate counter attack on the home planet of the invaders, Stroggos. By some twist of fate a sole marine was able to disable the Strogg main planetary defense (aka The Big Gun) and kill Makron, their leader. That was the end of Quake II. The second wave of attack is meant to land on Stroggos and take advantage of the brief disorder, ending the threat of the Strogg forever. Of course it will not be that easy...<br><br>This time the lone soldier theme (of Quake I, II and the Doom series) is replaced by a war. Not as large scale as a military FPS or even Halo, but close enough. There are squad mates, some of which are important to protect, some vehicles (a hovertank and a mech) and frequently changing objectives to achieve. The arsenal contains elements from all Quake games (nailgun, rail gun, lightning gun) and the classic BFG has been replaced by the Dark Matter Gun. Weapons can be improved later in the game, making them much more effective. The game uses a somewhat improved version of the Doom 3 engine to good effect. Multiplayer options are rather limited, offering only the standard Deathmatch modes and CTF.<br><br>Quake 4 was developed by Raven under the guidance of id Software.

As with the other Quake games, it is known for its freedom in movement. Advanced players using techniques such as rocket jumping, strafing and circle jumping to quickly get around areas.

Description=Quantz is a 3D color matching game. The player controls a rotating geometric shape floating at the center of the screen, peppered with small multi-colored spheres called Quantz on each face. New spheres keep appearing from the screen edges and falling towards the structure, and the objective is to turn the whole polyhedron to make them land on clusters of three or more globes of the same color, to make them disappear. When one of the balls is completely enclosed by a cluster of spheres, it can turn into a fireball after the surrounding balls are matched and removed. The fireball takes off the surface, and falls back burning clusters that share its color, creating new fireballs and giving combo points. Most of the balls are free-ranging, and react to the simulated physics by bouncing around and moving about the surface. Abrupt movements can send the spheres flying off the shape for a few seconds, but its gravity eventually pulls them back. This behavior can be exploited to solve some of the puzzles.<br><br>The game has three modes. In the strategy mode, the objective is to clear all the Quantz before all the energy runs out. The extra spheres are lined up on a ramp at the bottom of the screen, and the player shoots them towards the shape by pressing a button. In the puzzle mode, there's a limited amount of balls available, and the player must plan carefully where to deploy them to clear all the Quantz. The action mode is unlocked after completing ten levels of the puzzle mode, and is similar to the strategy mode. The main difference is the way the globes appear automatically hurling towards the surface, adding a more frenetic pace to the gameplay. The language can be selected from seven options: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian and Japanese.

The game mimics a MAME environment with classic games such as Defender, Gauntlet, The Legend of Zelda, QIX, Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Pang, Spy Hunter and more, in an ultimate mash-up.<br><br>Rather than emulating the games, the roms fail and distort the entire gameplay. Every five seconds, the main character, enemies, environment and background music are replaced with a random game. At one moment you're fighting Goombas with the Defender jet and The New Zealand Story music playing in the background, in another you are slashing your way through QIX with Link. The environment adapts to the new level graphics, but keeps its design. The player and both the enemies are however limited to the original controls. Zelda's top-down gameplay allows Link to travel through all the screen, but upon switching to Mario he will drop down immediately. The poor Space Invaders ship can only move left or right. The amount of defeated enemies is maintained and that way the player has to complete a set number of levels. After each successful round, an extra life is awarded.

A match of two colors at the same time gives 3 spells.<br><br>There is a rune matching game between levels, where a crystal at the center of the screen shows a rune for some seconds.

The fire spell (red and blue runes) is similar to the fire spells on the board, but it becomes more powerful with time. The magic sand (green runes) activates any spell on the board. The spread spell (silver and gold runes) turns the surrounding runes into the same color as the rune it falls on. The time bonus spell (gray runes) adds time. Each spell uses 5 Rune Magic points. Some spells can be cast with either one of two available colors. The spell uses the one that has more points collected.<br><br>On the regular levels the objective is to fill all the magic vials with their corresponding colors. On rainbow runes levels the goal is to collect all rainbow runes. They can only be removed with spells.

Save citizens in distress, stop falling pianos, battle wacky supervillains -- its all in a days work for a new superhero. Spandex Force contains eight episodes filled with different minigames and lots of tongue-in-cheek humor.<br><br>The main gameplay centers around a match-3 battle mechanic, in which the player uses his superpowers to defeat common criminals or supervillains. There are also many other minigames using variations of the match-3 mechanic in which the player has to collect enough power tokens within a certain time in order to accomplish the task -- stop a falling piano or plane, rescue an old lady from getting run over, stop a fire in a building, and more.<br><br>The game is divided into eight episodes in which the player collects clue points in order to progress with the storyline. Experience points are also awarded to level up the hero, and money and reputation points can also be collected. The different resources are used to gain access to hero base upgrades, new superpowers or artifacts containing bonuses. Each episode contains one or more supervillains to battle, and features a lot of dialogue parodying common superhero themes and ideas.

Description=Following the on-going war of the first Star Control game, the Alliance has lost. The Ur-Quan armada systematically hunts down the alliance races and imprisons them onto their homeworlds, including Earth. However unknown to the Ur-Quan, during the war, a small research vessel had been lost while sent to a distant star system looking for evidence of the ancient Precursor race. The survivors of this research team had come across the controls to a Starship factory and used it to build a Precursor supply vessel: one of the largest vessels in the galaxy. It's time for these Terrans to return to Earth...<br><br>Star Control II is a game based on exploration, space combat, diplomacy and resource gathering. Your main starship is the Precursor vessel and it can be used to travel between star systems. This uses fuel which must be processed in exchange for raw materials. In addition to providing fuel, raw materials can also be used to make purchases. You can use them to improve your starship, buy ships for your fleet, and hire crewmembers (who represent your ships' "health"). <br><br>Raw materials are found on surfaces of planets throughout the galaxy; you have to send a landing module to the planet and then guide it around the surface as it picks up the materials you found earlier with your scanner. Each planet is unique in the type of minerals and metals it is formed of. Some planets are plagued by natural dangers such as lightning storms, earthquakes or lava which can damage or destroy your landing modules. Non-sentient lifeforms can also be found and stunned to obtain biological samples. Special installations, objects and ruins can also be found on certain planets. <br><br>While in "deep space", your starship can approach any star you come across, and then you can guide your ship around its system and land on its planets and their moons. Space is treated as two-dimensional and presented in a top-down view. There is also a starmap available which shows the entire galaxy and allows you to set your ship on auto-pilot to any star. <br><br>Throughout space are different alien civilizations. These are represented on the starmap by a sphere of influence. Within the sphere, the aliens have a controlling presence and their ships will venture freely. Outside the sphere, encounters are rarer. Aliens can be dealt with diplomatically, through a series of dialog options, or in combat. <br><br>Combat utilizes the same engine as the first Star Control game, where action is controlled from a top view and influenced by the gravity of nearby planets. Each alien vessel is controlled uniquely and has unique abilities. Combat can also be played as a standalone game ("melee mode"), separate from the main storyline.

Humans use guns while aliens are class-based and rely on speed and melee attacks. By killing foes, aliens earn frags that can be used to evolve to stronger mutations. Humans, on the other hand, either spawn with a weapon or a construction kit, and they earn credits by killing aliens. Those credits can be exchanged in the armoury for new equipment. When a team reaches a set amount of frags, a new stage of development is occupied. Aliens get access to advanced creatures with healing and construction abilities, while humans acquire new building options, better weapons and stronger armour. There are three stages in total.<br><br>Each race has important constructions that must be defended. For the aliens, the Overmind is vital. It controls the production of eggs and the upgrade abilities. Humans have a Reactor as a main power source. There are additional defensive constructions such as barricades, alien tubes and turrets, or hives, eggs and telenodes as extensions of the main structures. These have distinct abilities as well. In an advanced development stage, aliens can build them on walls or ceilings, and they slow down humans with creep, or spray acid when destroyed. The overall objective is to destroy the opposing team.<br><br>The game was originally developed as a total conversion for Quake III, but later, after the release of the 3D engine's source code, turned into a standalone product.

The effect is cumulative, so a small ship can quickly become a huge gathering of lego-like boxes. The enemy tends to adapt to the ship's power, firing more bullets if the ships become large. There is no collision detection with the enemy ships, only with their bullets. Next to a key to shoot, there is another one to pull in the acquired parts. This is used when a large numbers of bullets is fired and the player wants to avoid them without damaging the parts.<br><br>The 3D graphics are in pastel colours, with large, minimalistic shapes. It later became the inspiration of the Wii game Blast Works: Build, Trade, Destroy where the original game can also be unlocked.

Description=Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it's now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3. <br><br>At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point. <br><br>The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it's called assault. These are real missions, like you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10 minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.<br><br>All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots.  Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.

Description=Unreal Tournament 2004 is the third game in the popular Unreal Tournament series.<br><br>This latest edition includes several new features.  First and foremost is the return of Assault mode from the original Unreal Tournament.  This mode pits two teams, attackers and defenders, against each other.  The attackers must try to complete various objectives, and the defenders have to stop them.  At the end of the round, whether time runs out or the attackers win, the roles are switched, and the defenders become the attackers.  A mode new to 2004 is Onslaught.  Another team-based mode, there are several Power Nodes spread throughout the map, with one base per team that houses a large Power Core.  The players must go to each Power Node, link it to the enemy Core, and eventually attack the enemy Power Core itself.  Rounding out the remainder of the game modes is the standard Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Double Domination, Bombing Run, Last Man Standing, Invasion, and Mutant, for a total of ten different game modes. An additional official game mode is Vehicle CTF, which will only appear in the gametype browser after the user adds a VCTF map in the Maps directory, be it an official VCTF map (released after the game was published) or releases from amateur mapmakers.<br><br>There are several weapons available to you, all of which come with a secondary fire.  You have a shield gun, an assault rifle (which can be dual wielded if you pick up a second one after an enemy or ally dies while holding one, much like the Enforcer in the original Unreal Tournament), a shock rifle, Redeemer missile launchers (which can launch a missile guided by you), an AVRiL missile launcher, a lightning gun, a rocket launcher and a flak cannon, to name a few.<br><br>2004 features, for the first time, vehicles, which are available in Onslaught, Assault and VCTF. You can hop into a tank (Goliath), a humvee (HellBender), a lightweight wheeled vehicle (called the Scorpion and relatively similar to the Warthog in Halo), a juggernaut vehicle (Leviathan) and several different hovering or flying vehicles, notably some space ships in some Assault maps such as AS-Mothership. Each vehicle has its own characteristics, some can hold multiple players and additionally some players can hitch a ride by standing on the external body of the vehicle. Some vehicles also have a personalized license plate with the name of the player driving it.<br><br>There are over one hundred maps to choose from.  A lot of them are remakes from the past versions of the game, and there are several new ones made for 2004. Most maps for UT2003 are compatible with UT2004. Maps can be downloaded in the future, from official sources or from amateur mapmakers.<br><br>Unreal Tournament 2004 also includes a detailed single player campaign, in which you earn credits by competing in tournaments, which you then use to draft a team to compete in team-based tournaments.  You work your way up qualifying ladders to the championship.<br><br>2004 supports voice chat. It also includes the possibility to give a limited number of command through speech recognition. The game also supports text-to-speech, translation in-game text messages into voice messages using the computer default SAPI 4/ SAPI 5 synthesis voice.

The gameplay is similar to Rainbow Six and Counter-Strike, but with the inclusion of the fast-paced Quake movement, with strafe jumping, but also wall jumping, ledge climbing and power sliding (4.0). In general, damage is also less severe compared to the aforementioned games. At all times, players can only carry a limited amount of weapons.<br><br>Although the game is playable offline, it is meant to be played online with multiple people. The available game modes are free for all/deathmatch, team deathmatch, team survivor, capture the flag, capture and hold, follow the leader and bomb mode. Players spawn with a knife but can pick up weapons such as pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, rifles, machine guns and grenades, along with a kevlar vest or helmet, laser sight, silencer, night vision goggles or additional ammo and health.

Description=World of Goo is a physics-based puzzle game where players need to build constructions using balls of goo. The original concept is based on the prototype Tower of Goo Unlimited! by Kyle Gabler, one of the developers of this game, created for the Experimental Gameplay Project website.<br><br>Rather than a series of puzzles, the game presents the balls of goo as living creatures in a universe they set to explore. They need to find out about the power source of the world they live in and the true meaning behind the Goo Corporation. In most of the levels, the constructions need to reach a pipe that sucks the goo balls out of the level. To succeed, players need to bring over a certain amount of balls or do it within a limited amount of time. There are also OCDs (Obsessive Completion Distinction) where players can aim for secondary, much more difficult goals.<br><br>Each level brings entirely new challenges, based on gameplay, environment elements, art style and types of goo balls. Regular balls can be dragged and dropped with the mouse or wii remote to form cohesive connections, but only for a short distance. Because of the physics and the wobbly matter, a solid basis is required. Balls can be picked up and moved around to adapt the constructions. While buildings sometimes timebugs will appear. When clicked, they allow the player to go back in time for one move. The types of goo differ greatly in abilities, connections and response to physics. Some of the goo balls introduced gradually are ivy goo (attach and detach at will), albino goo (four connections), balloon goo (fly upwards), water goo, pokey goo, fuse goo, bone goo, and much more. In some levels, sleeping balls can be woken up to join the construction. Constructions not only bend, but can also be broken when gravity gets the upper hand. In later chapters, players acquire a whistle that can be used to lure all loose goo balls in a certain direction.<br><br>More of the world is revealed through cut-scenes and sequences during gameplay, always with a humourous nod. There are five main chapters with different levels that follow chronologically for one year in the world of goo. The environment is changed to reflect the season. Often, players will save more balls of goo than required. These are stored in the World of Goo Corporation, a separate level reminiscent of the original prototype the game is based on. There, players can use extra goo balls to build a construction as high as possible. With an online connection, it is possible to view the height of other players. In-game hints are provided through signs that can be clicked and contribute to the story.<br><br>The Wii port supports up to four players simultaneously in cooperative gameplay. The PC port is single-player only but features online leaderboards where players can compare their scores to one another.

Description=X-Plane 6 is a flight simulator using the blade element theory. It runs on several computer platforms. It provides a real time simulation of flight using actual weather info, aircraft systems performance and failures, accurate topographical data and real world navaids (over 25,600) and airports (over 21,000). X-Plane is bundled with tools to design and modify aircraft, navaids and scenery. Also, various aircraft models have been included such as the Boeing 747, Piper Malibu, F-22 Raptor, Cessna 172, Bell 206, X-15, and Space Shuttle to name a few. <br><br>This version differs from the previous in the following major areas:<br><br>1. Minimum resolution increased to 1024x768.<br>2. New scenery format with 5 times the number of elevation points.<br>3. Auto-generated buildings.<br>4. New aircraft format with new texture format and greatly increased flexibility in instruments. Vastly improved default instruments.<br>5. Round world terrain model that eliminates the old distortions and errors.<br>6. Major terrain upgrade: improved terrain accuracy for the US, land use data, all new terrain textures, roads, rivers, power lines, etc.<br>7. Custom scenery folders.<br><br>General Information<br>X-Plane uses the so called blade element theory (19th century) to calculate aircraft behaviour. In essence this theory regards each surface as an airfoil and calculates the forces acting upon to derive its velocity. Hence the way the aircraft handles and behaves is governed by its shape, weight, centre of gravity (CG), drag and thrust. Other flight simulators have chosen to use tables for aircraft performance. One benefit of that approach is that less powerful computers can perform the simulation. By using different factors for density, gravity, X-Plane will allow for flights in a different atmosphere. An included example is Mars.<br><br>Plug-Ins enhance this simulator further by adding for instance realtime online flying, flight planning and control. X-Plane can output data which can be fed to such as motion platforms, displays, navigation systems or home-built cockpits. It can also receive data from external sources such as RC-flight controls, Garmin GPS system, or your own flight model. Different angles of view can be output to up to 5 individual monitors (or streamed over the LAN/Internet).<br><br>The game's flight model and supplied design tools are used in visualisation, aircraft model testing and feasibility studies for real life aircraft. A library of standard NACA airfoils has been included. There are a number of companies that use X-Plane, such as NASA, CarterCopter (helicopter),  and Terrafugia (Transition - street legal aircraft). While other companies such as C74 offer design services for aircraft builders and DARPA. People from all walks of life (engineers, aviation enthusiasts, pilots, lawyers) have offered their design to major registries such as x-plane.org, and avsim.com. The X-Plane aircraft and scenery collections total over 1,500 submissions and updates.

Description=Yo Frankie! is a Creative Commons open source game project developed using Crystal Space and Blender. Based on the characters from the open movie project Big Buck Bunny, it is a 3D platformer. Rather than a complete game experience, it is presented as a set of individual levels that can be selected from the main menu.<br><br>Players control a squirrel who is able to run, glide through the air, attack, and collect bonus and nuts to throw them at opponents. As there is no real level progression, most of the game experience is based on exploring the different parts of the environment. Enemies include rat and sheep. Often, there are small puzzle elements that involve moving a spring to jump on platforms, or a combination of double jumping and gliding to reach far away areas.<br><br>Developed on a 50,000 budget, the game was initially made available to the sponsors on a game DVD.

Description=Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates allows the player to create a pirate character and participate in an online society. Unlike most games in the MMO genre, Puzzle Pirates offers an alternative to monthly subscription fees. Although there are servers which do run on traditional subscriptions, there are others which are entirely free to play on. The important difference is that these latter servers have an extra currency called "doubloons". Most of the items in the game have a doubloon cost (in addition to a cost in "pieces of eight", the other currency), and there are two ways for players to obtain doubloons - they may either trade them for pieces of eight on an in-game market, or they can be purchased with real-world money via the game's website. This micropayment system allows players with cash to spare to pay to make it easier to obtain the more expensive items, while giving players who cannot afford to pay the option of working harder in the game to earn more pieces of eight to trade for their doubloons.<br><br>Many of the game's mechanics, such as the duties on board a ship (sailing, carpentry, bilging, navigating, gunning), involve playing a specific puzzle. The better the player performs at the puzzle, the better the ship will be able to do battle against NPCs or other player-manned ships. After a hard day's pillaging, pirates can relax in the inns and play a selection of games in competition against other players. These range from card games such as Hearts and Poker to massive swordfighting tournaments. Some of the puzzles in the game may be familiar to dedicated puzzle fans, as many are quite similar to popular titles like Puzzle Bobble, Super Puzzle Fighter, or the puzzlers by PopCap.<br><br>The game also features a robust economic system which allows players to invest money in opening a variety of different shops for the production of various kinds of goods. Some of these are necessities for successful piracy (cannonballs, rum, swords, and the ships themselves) and some are simply luxuries (clothes and furniture for your house), but all require resources which are specific to certain islands, meaning that one must travel and trade in order to operate a profitable business.<br><br>The game is available for free download online, but a limited run of boxed games was released by Ubisoft in 2005. This special release added a basic offline story mode and allowed new pirates to choose one of two special items unique to owners of the boxed version.
