Description=Alice in Wonderland: An Adventure Beyond the Mirror is a tie-in for the 2010 Tim Burton's movie Alice in Wonderland. It is loosely based on the movie's story, borrowing from it main characters such as Alice, the White Rabbit, the Cheshire Cat, the March Hare and the Mad Hatter.<br><br>It is a 2D platform puzzle game bearing some similarities to The Lost Vikings series. The main objective in each stage is take Alice from left to right until the end of the stage. The stages can be transposed either by taking Alice through Wonderland or through a mirror version of Wonderland, accessed by mirrors which will work like doorways. Some mirrors will be shattered, so Alice will need to collect the missing pieces to fix and then use them.<br><br>Alice can only run right and left or jump. In order to proceed in some locations, the player must swap Alice for the other characters, which she will find along the way. Each character has a special ability and can be called upon just to use them, not to move. The White Rabbit can stop time for some objects; the Cheshire Cat can make objects appear and disappear; the March Hare can use telekinesis to move an object from a point to another and the Mad Hatter can transform objects from one world to another. Some locations will demand the combination of two or more characters' abilities. When the player reaches the end of a stage, a map of Wonderland will be shown, displaying the next location available as well as the already completed ones. As new characters join Alice's party, the player can replay a stage to reach specific areas which weren't reachable before (without those character abilities). <br>Some low ceiling areas will require Alice to drink the "drink me" bottle to be transposed, only to eat the "eat me" candy to regain her normal size.<br><br>The obstacles faced are mostly water sections, bottomless pits, spikes and the like. There are Red Queen soldiers in some stages, which can't be killed, only bypassed. Some stages have passages similar to holes opened by torn portions of a book page. In those passages, Alice will find hidden objects, which can be collected and accessed in Alice's journal outside the game. The iPhone version also offers different ways of unlocking those objects, with the player's GPS, Camera and Photo Library. Some other objects can be unlocked by solving riddles or by logging in on specific dates, such as the date when Alice's original Disney movie was released.

Description=Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you.

To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!

Description=Powerboat Challenge is a powerboat racing game. The player has to race his boat round buoys; red buoys must be passed on the left, the green ones must be passed on the right. The closer the player passes to the buoy, the more style points he or she gets and the more boost is given to the boat. When the boost meter is full, the player can use it to speed up the boat for a while. If one buoy is missed, the player loses all his or her boost charge and the boat slows down; if three buoys are missed, he or she is disqualified from that race. A style rating is also given by the end of each race.<br><br>In race events, arriving among the 3 first places awards the player a medal (gold, silver or bronze) and a prize in money. In time trials the player has to beat a pre-defined time to earn the medals.

The money can be used to buy boat upgrades. In the beginning of the game the player can select one of four characters with different ratings on attributes such as top speed, acceleration, agility and turbo. The upgrades bought will improve the boat in those attributes.<br><br>The game features 4 islands (Richmore, Brookfield, Culuá and Akonisos) with different scenarios (swamps, icy seas, rainforest rivers) and events in each of them.

Description=An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.<br><br>id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.<br><br>In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.<br><br>Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.<br><br>The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.<br><br>Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

Description=Zuma's Revenge is the sequel to Zuma Deluxe, an extremely popular marble shooter released in 2003 by PopCap. As in the previous game, the main goal is to clear a series of marble strings by matching three or more balls of the same color. The spheres roll on twisting tracks that occupy most of the screen, appearing from one side and moving towards the gaping mouth of a golden skull. The player controls a frog that is either stationed near the tracks or moving sideways at the bottom. The amphibian holds one of the colored balls in its open mouth, and a reserve one inside its body.<br><br>The main Adventure Mode is divided in sequential zones, each with several levels. The main objective of each level is to aim and shoot at the moving lines to make three-of-a-kind color matches and fill a meter at the top to finish. If three or more balls enter the exit hole, the player loses one life and the level has to be replayed. When all lives are spent, the whole zone has to be restarted from the latest automatic checkpoint, usually at mid-point.<br><br>Some of the spheres are marked with icons and have power-ups that can be activated with matches. The bomb explodes all the surrounding spheres, the reticule improves shot accuracy by giving temporary laser targeting sights to the frog, the rewind arrow pushes all the marbles backwards, the hand slowdowns movement for some seconds, the lightning bolt vaporizes all the balls of one color, the tri-shot fires three cannon balls that destroy anything in their path and the laser surgically removes single spheres. Some levels have pairs of lily pads, and the frog can jump between them to eliminate all the marbles.<br><br>A boss battle happens at the end of each zone, where the opponent is an idol mask that keeps moving sideways at the top. The frog moves at the bottom and has to hit the enemy with several spheres to defeat it, while at the same time matching the moving line of spheres to clear the field. Each boss has a different attack and defense strategy, throwing enchantment shots at the frog and putting obstacles and minions to block the area.<br><br>Besides Adventure Mode, there are three additional modes that are gradually unlocked as the levels are completed in the main game. In Challenge Mode, the objective is to achieve a high score under three minutes. The top meter is replaced by a bonus gauge that slowly fills with every match. When it is full, it transforms one of the spheres into a multiplier that gives bonus points after being matched. The Heroic Frog Mode is a harder version of Adventure Mode, with the spheres moving faster and with more color variations from the start. Iron Frog Mode is unlocked after finishing Adventure Mode, and is the hardest mode where the player has only one life available to complete ten difficult levels in sequence.
