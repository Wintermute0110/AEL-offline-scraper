Description=3D Lawn Darts takes the classic game of lawn darts and brings it to mobile devices.  Lawn darts is a game played outside where you lob big metal darts at a circle on the ground.  The game was banned in the United States and Canada because of all the injuries.<br><br>The unique thing with 3D Lawn Darts (besides having a full 3D game on a mobile device) is that it uses real motion for throwing the darts.  The way this works is that the mobile device must have a camera that the game can use.  Then during the game, it vibrates to let you know to toss the dart.  Once the person feels the vibration, he/she then makes a throwing motion while a picture is taken.  The game then analyzes the pictures blur to decide where the dart goes.  Once the motion is made he/she can view the screen and follow the dart in the 3D world through the air till it hits the target.<br><br>Besides the motion other features of the game are choice of 3D world (4 choices), choice of player to throw the dart (4 choices again) and different types of darts to throw.  Dart choices include flaming darts, nuclear darts, magnetic darts, and more.

Description=The year is 1999. Kaida's father disappeared fifteen years ago, and now, all of the sudden, Kaida receives a letter from Athemys, urging him to visit the Portland Mansion, where his father was seen for the last time. Fay, a young girl, awakes at the same place. She has no clue where she is, but she feels it has something to do with her past, a door she has been keeping shut for too long.<br><br>After Dark: Under the Moon Light is the second top-down anime-styled RPG in the After Dark series. You can play as Kaida or Fay. The gameplay and levels stay the same, but there are a few plot twists. Kaida carries a mythril sword for regulars attacks, and Fay can attack using her lamp. Each character also has a distinct move: Kay can dash while Fay can toggle a walk/run mode to get out of difficult situations quickly. During the quest, the characters meet each other, and you have to search the mansion and the underground while solving puzzles. This involves looking for keys, and collecting coins, spirit stones and other items. There are also new weapons to be found, such as a blood sword for Kaida, and a magical bow for Fay.<br><br>Items are stored in a separate screen, and you can collect health kits and special abilities such as invisibility or slowing down time. Different weapons can be equipped with specifications based on "Speed", "Attack" and "Defense". Opponents include witches, flying skulls, ghosts and monsters, and there also a few NPCs you can talk too, with conversations shown in a dialogue window with a portrait. A save option is available.

Description=Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).<br><br>At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.<br><br>Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

Description=Farm Frenzy is a straightforward time-management game, where the player controls a farm, raising animals and selling products to the market. The main game screen is mostly occupied by a central bare patch of land where the farm animals roam, surrounded by a series of farm implements and machines. All necessary actions are performed with clicks over interactive hotspots of the scenery.<br><br>The objective is displayed at the start of the level, usually requiring a certain amount of resources, money or other goals. Initially, the player has to click on the well to collect water and on the ground to grow the grass that feeds most of the livestock. The animals can be purchased from a tab at the top, to eat the turf and generate products every few moments. Geese lay eggs, sheep shed cotton, cows produce milk, and all these resources have to be collected and stacked on boxes at the bottom storage shed. The boxes have to be shipped to the market by clicking on the truck, that takes a few moments to make the transportation of all the selected goods. A small animation at the bottom-right shows the vehicle going back and forth between the farm and the city.<br><br>Dangerous bears appear randomly on the farm, and kill any animal that cross their paths. They have to be quickly contained on cages, and afterwards collected on boxes to be sold as a product. If the cage remains untouched on the field for too long, the bear eventually breaks free and runs out of the farm. The storage space at the bottom is limited, and sometimes bears and other products can't be stored on time and disappear after a while.<br><br>The structures surrounding the game field are used to process the raw materials produced by the farm into more refined products, like powdered eggs, cheese, baked goods and other items. The stars received after completing a level have to be spent on upgrades to the machines on the shop screen, to make them more efficient and unlock new levels. There is no time limit to complete each stage, but finishing within a specific time frame, shown at the top, gives awards and bonus stars.

Description=Super Fighter Block Battle picks up the story after Super Fighter, but the beat-em-up gameplay is now presented as a Tetris variant. The game pits the player against computer (or human) controlled opponents who can be defeated by either filling their screen with garbage blocks or by knocking them out. This is done by clearing more lines and faster than the opponent. Damage is based on previous hints and the amount of blocks on the screen. There are also flashing blocks that heal the player when they are used to form a line.<br><br>The game offers three game modes: a story mode, a two player mode (using two copies of the game, two phones and a bluetooth connection) and a practice mode.

Description=You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up. <br><br>You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. <br><br>The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.<br><br>Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.

When all tiles are turned up, the game is completed. For each pair the player earns points. The score is multiplied when several pairs in a row are made. The game features three different game modes:<br><br>1. Sly - the player has to turn all tiles with a limited number of attempts<br><br>2. Agile - the game is timed and the player has to turn all tiles before the time is up. Extra time is awarded for each pair found<br><br>3. Smart - the player has to score as many points as possible. The number of points awarded for each pair is lowered when the player mismatches

Vector Blaster uses a 3D engine to put an updated spin on the old vector/line graphics style. Gameplay is done level-by-level; in each the goal is pretty much the same: blow up the bad things flying at you while avoiding things you can't blow up and grabbing power ups. Bosses are thrown in every few levels to spice things up.<br><br>The bosses include &quot;the twin shooter spinning bad guy&quot; - This dude fires explosives at you that, if gone untouched, will damage your movement ability and lock you in a corner, and &quot;the big evil floating head of doom named Ghotran&quot;.

Description=Westward is a real-time strategy game similar to the Settlers series and the more recent Virtual Villagers. The player must build and maintain a wild west town, and perform certain tasks to progress. Some of these include finding lost treasures, gun-fighting desperadoes and blowing up obstacles with dynamite.<br><br>All the actions are performed by clicking and holding the mouse button over a character or a group of characters, and dragging a line of dots to a place or object in the terrain.  When the end of the line is over a collectable object, the cursor changes to a purse. When it is over a building with housing facilities or a job opportunity, it changes to either a house icon or an icon of shaking hands. Releasing the button makes the character follow the line path to the objective and perform the action.<br><br>Certain characters, like the Sheriff and gunslingers, have to be hired at their respective buildings, but most settlers arrive at the city spontaneously as soon as the city population limit increases.<br><br>Each citizen and building consume a fixed amount of resources like food, wood and gold. Buildings also create resources, and need employees to function. Some of the characters' status is indicated by icons floating over their heads. A food icon, for example, shows that the character is hungry.<br><br>The city is afflicted by random disasters. Cyclones damage the buildings, droughts and famine diminish productivity, and an insufficient number of outhouses can produce an outbreak of plague.<br><br>Combat follows the same interface of the other actions. The dotted line is dragged from a combat character or a group of them, and the cursor changes to a firing pistol when it's over an enemy.<br><br>There are side-missions within each level. Usually a character comes bringing news or a request for help. Clicking "okay" on the dialog box loads a separate level. Once it is completed, the game returns to the main city.
