Description=Based on the scripts of the 21st movie "Casino Royale" and the 22nd James Bond movie of the same name as the game, it follows closely the story of those movies but elaborates many scenes and fills in some blanks.<br><br>In a first person shooter fashion, the player directs Bond through the levels filled with many bad guys. To overcome those, Bond has several different kinds of weapons at his disposal ranging from his trusted P99, over machine guns to full blown grenade launchers. But the levels are also filled with canisters that either explode upon shooting or vent gas that temporarily blinds the enemy. Bond can also perform a take down move which puts an enemy out silently. If Bond is near enough to an enemy, a button press will initiate the corresponding mini-game in which the player needs to hit a circle with a crosshair in a short period of time. Is the player successful,  the enemy is out of the play but when he fails to hit the mark in time, Bond will be thrown away from the enemy and is vulnerable for a short period of time. In addition Bond can duck into cover to avoid bullets and shoot blindly over it or look out of it to get the kill. Bond also automatically regenerates his health when not under fire.<br><br>Other obstacles in the levels are cameras, which can either be shot or disabled and electronic locks which need to be hacked in another mini-game. There arrows flash green or red on the screen and the player needs to press the corresponding button fast enough when it blink green to input the right number into the keypad.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode for up to 12 players with the following game modes:<br><br>1. Bond Versus: one player takes over the control of James Bond and either needs to defuse two of the three bombs in the level or kill all six of the opposing team. In this mode Bond can also see all enemies and has two lives.<br><br>2. Golden Gun: the first player to score 100 points wins the round. Points are earned by kills but if the player is holding the always visible power weapon called "Golden Gun", he scores 6 points per kill.<br><br>3. Bond Evasion: in this mode one member of the MI6-team randomly gets to be Bond and needs to get to the escape point of the map to win the round for his team. Meanwhile The Organization tries to stop him by either killing him or preventing him to reach the escape points in time.

Description=0D Beat Drop is a falling block puzzle game with musical elements similar to the Lumines titles (the beat matching system from those titles was licensed for 0D Beat Drop). But rather than scenic design, the player needs to combine the puzzling with matching the beat as an essential part of the gameplay. The basic layout is similar to Tetris. There is a playing field where groups of three pieces in a square of four tiles drop down. To the right the next groups can be previewed and there is also a beat meter that moves along with the game's music. The goal is to avoid having the stacked pieces reaching the top of the screen.<br><br>The groups drop down and can be moved around and rotated. They need to be positioned to form matches of three identical pieces: horizontal, vertical of in an L-shape. These do not disappear right away when formed, but only when you perform a Beat Drop. When the pieces are dropped with a separate button when the beat meter is near the top of the bar, the matched pieces disappear, additional points are scored and a multiplier is built up. Timing it wrong does not clear anything even if there are matches on the playing field. While the multiplier builds up it becomes harder to match the beat and perform a Beat Drop. Eliminated pieces become shadow pieces and are sent to the opponent's playfield, similar to the Puyo Puyo games, as most game modes focus on competitive play against a friend or AI opponent. A good player will first stack up chains and then perform a large Beat Drop to attack the opponent, but due to the increased difficulty of making a successful drop at a high multiplier, there is a risk of missing it. In that case all the shadow pieces end up on your own playfield. When you create a chain when the opponent is about to send you those pieces, you can create a chain yourself to counter and clear the pieces right away. Shadow pieces are shown as hollow objects and can still be used in a regular fashion to create chains.<br><br>Advanced players can enter the Hyper Mode. When you allow shadow pieces to fall into your playfield twice, consecutively, without performing a beat drop, this mode is activated (with at least 42 shadow pieces). At that moment it is possible to make a huge comeback or risk it all.<br><br>The singleplayer game modes are:<br><br>1. Planet Quest: one player against the computer<br>2. Survival Four: one player against three AI opponents<br>3. Co-op With COM: work together with a computer player in 2-on-2 battles<br>4. Time Attack: reach a target score in three modes<br>5. Task: complete different challenges<br>6. Watch AI battle: watch two computer opponents play<br><br>The multiplayer game modes are:<br><br>1. 2 Player Versus<br>7. 2 Player Co-op<br>8. 4 Player Versus<br>9. 4 Player Team Versus<br><br>There is also a music player to listen to the in-game music and a Beat-O-Matic where your own music from a music player or the Xbox 360 hard drive is captured, analysed and synchronized to be used in the game.

The only way out of each room is to push a block onto a yellow switch, which will open a door leading to the next room. Many rooms contain hazards like ogres, bats, and lava, and one touch will kill the hero. Many rooms also contain signs left by a previous traveler, offering hints, instructions, and sometimes insane rambling. The player has infinite lives, and can reset the stage if it becomes unsolvable. The game features 40 puzzles to solve, and allows the player to return to any previously-visited stage through the options menu.

Description=Aliens vs Predator is an update of the 1999 PC game  Aliens Versus Predator, in which the player can choose either Marine, Xenomorph (commonly known as Aliens) or Predator in a first-person shooter.  The story takes place on the planet designated BG-386, in a mining colony owned by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation where they have found a mysterious site; an ancient pyramid that depicts an unknown alien race and the Xenomorphs.  Curious, they decide to forcibly open the doors and cause a massive energy backlash that causes the power on the entire planet to go out, unleashing hell in the process.  This is where the story begins for the three factions:<br><br>1. Marines:  The player takes control of the &quot;Rookie&quot; as they are dispatched to the planet to investigate the distress signal.  Once arriving they realize that a Alien outbreak has occurred and the player must traverse various environments.  There are various weapons such as a pistol, pulse rifle, sniper rifle, flamethrower, shotgun and the smart gun the player can use against the various enemies scattered throughout the stages.  There is also the iconic motion tracker that can pick up on enemy movement, flares and a flashlight for seeing in very dark spaces and stims that will replenish their health.<br><br>2. Aliens:  The player takes control of an Alien nicknamed &quot;Six&quot;.  Captured and raised by Weyland-Yutani scientists, Six has been hearing the call of the Matriarch for a period of time, desperate to escape and join his brethren.  When the power in the colony goes out, Six escapes and begins to wreak havoc against the humans and propagate his species across the planet.  The Aliens are considered very weak and vulnerable and only have their claws and tails as weapons, but possess great speed and the ability to climb on walls and ceilings.  Health can automatically regenerate, but the player can bite the head of a fallen enemy to automatically regenerate their health.<br><br>3. Predators:  The player takes control of a Youngblood; fresh from training he receives word from the Predator council that a distress signal from a long lost hunting ground has been set off.  He is then dispatched to the planet to investigate, upon arriving he discovers humans have taken over the planet and unleashed the serpents (The term the Predators use for the Aliens) upon the planet.  The council orders him to wipe out the human and alien presence and discover the secret of the hunting grounds.  Weapons include the Plasma Caster, Wrist blades, Combi-Stick, Mines and the Smart Disc with health being replenished through shards.  The Predator can also leap across long distances, mimic voices to distract victims away from groups and use their signature cloaking device to move through enemy encampments without being detected.<br><br>Along with the single-player campaign there are also several multiplayer modes including:<br><br>1. Survivor: A group of four marines surviving against waves of advancing aliens.<br><br>4. Predator Hunt: Out of a group of Marines one will be chosen to be the Predator, the goal being that the player can use the Predator to gain extra points through killing other players and extend the time limit of being the Predator.  If a Marine player can kill the Predator then they will become Predator until they are killed or time runs out.<br><br>5. Infestation: Similar to Predator Hunt, out of a group of Marines one will be chosen to be an Alien, the goal of being to kill the Marines and earn points.  However, when an Alien player kills a Marine then that Marine will become an Alien and join that player.<br><br>6. Deathmatch: Standard free-for-all ranging up to 18-players<br><br>7. Species Deathmatch: Three groups of players use teamwork to take out the other teams of the opposite species, basically Marines vs. Aliens vs. Predators.<br><br>8. Mixed Species Deathmatch: Three groups of players of mixed species fighting other mixed teams.<br><br>9. Domination: A group of players vie for various strongholds scattered throughout the map, the goal of which to take these points and reach a certain point count to win the match.<br><br>Players also gain experience points through winning matches, killing enemies in different ways (i.e. getting more points for trophy kills) or a killing streak.  Using these points the player can unlock additional skins in the multiplayer's main menu.

The APL consists of 24 teams grouped into six divisions of four teams each.<br><br>The ruleset drifts between the strictness of Madden series and the freedom of Blitz: The League. Horse-collar tackles and late hits are allowed, but  for the latter players are penalized with a fifteen-yard personal foul.

Description=It has been 83 years since Edward Carnby investigated the suicide of Jeremy Hartwood. Now he wakes up in an apartment in New York and is moments away from being shot by a group of bad guys. He doesn't remember much and as he looks into a mirror, a man looks back at him that isn't even near the age of 80. But as all hell breaks loose and mysterious forces tear through the building and the city itself, the question about his looks becomes one of many. To make things even worse, an old enemy decides to return in a search for a powerful stone. So for Carnby a race for survival begins and all signs point to Central Park.<br><br>Edward's mysterious journey is divided into eight episodes that can be played in chronological order or can be accessed directly from the main menu. Once in the game, the player controls Edward either in a 1st-person or a 3rd-person manner either by switching manually or depending on the situation and what item he uses. If he picks up a fire extinguisher for example, the player will be able to extinguish fires with it if he is in 1st-person mode. In 3rd-person mode it instead becomes a deadly weapon or a battering ram.<br><br>This is especially important since Edward won't find much ammunition for the pistols, shotguns and other weapons in the game. Instead he needs to be creative and use the items he finds or the environment for his advantage. Especially since most enemies can only be permanently killed by burning them, igniting a wooden chair at a nearby fire, or using a lighter and a can of hairspray are Edward's best bets to knock them out.<br><br>Fire plays an important role in the game at all times. If not extinguished, it will slowly burn through anything in the vicinity and spread until everything burnable has been reduced to a smoking pile of ash. This behavior can of course be useful to Edward if he for instance wants to get through a closed wooden door and has nothing heavy at hand to force his way.

Description=Michael Thornton. A name without a past. A person whose life before joining Alpha Protocol no longer exist. Alpha Protocol being a clandestine service without any ties to the US government and specialized in covert operations to protect home and country. Thornton's mission: Assassinate the leader of Al-Samad known as "Shaheed". Shaheed's crime: Destroying a passenger plane in the Middle East. An easy task it would seem. But life is never that easy - especially if one has to deal with terrorists. In the end, Shaheed is just the beginning of a greater conspiracy and it's up to Mike and the player to save the world.<br><br>Bearing many similarities to Deus Ex, the player takes over the control of Michael Thornton after his initiation into the world of Alpha Protocol, looking over his shoulder. At the start of the game, the player has to choose one of four classes (Soldier, Field Agent, Tech Specialist, Freelancer). The choice mostly determines his past as he can change all pre-defined skills before the final start of the game. In addition the player has to customizes the basic look of Mike although during the course of the game he is still able to change his appearance at his safe house and certain lockers scattered around the levels. He is limited to facial features (including color) and clothing however. <br><br>After the tutorial, the player is send out to different safe houses around the globe including Rome, Moscow and Taipei. Here, the player is able to select and prepare his next mission in peace. There's a TV which allows the player to keep up with current events (or get new assignments), a weapons locker to choose his load-out with and, more importantly, a computer to check his email and visit the "Clearinghouse". The latter is a black market service where the player can sell stuff he found during missions and buy additional gear (including weapons, armor and special items) or upgrades like a bigger magazine for the pistol. The money needed for that however, the player has to earn himself. Alpha Protocol doesn't want to be traced back to Mike, so during the missions, the player not only fulfills his given objectives, may they be capturing or killing an enemy or finding intel, but is also on the lookout for money-bags lying around or ways to convince other people to give him some.<br><br>This is mostly done through dialogues which, similar to Mass Effect 2, offer several different choices. But as opposed the Bioware-game, the player only has a limited time to make his choice. The amount of available choices the player has, greatly depends on how much the Mike knows about the person he's facing, increasing the need for him to gather intel before, during and after missions. One way again is the Clearinghouse which also offers ways to make a mission easier like bribing a bunch of guards to not show up for work that day.<br><br>Depending on his choice during a dialogue or simply by answering an email a special way and during normal gameplay, not only his relationship with the person he's talking to changes - news of the player's actions travel around the world, changing how enemies and friendlies alike view the player even before their first encounter, making it sometimes easier or more difficult for Mike to persuade his opponent. Every person in the game even reacts to certain kinds of attitudes better than others. Being suave to Mina (another employee of Alpha Protocol) may seem a good idea at first but she's more into the professional type for example.<br><br>If all fails and on his way to the main target, Mike has several other options to deal with a situation, the most obvious one being to pull out one of his several different types of guns and shoot his way through the mission. But even then just going in and pulling the trigger is mostly a waste of ammo as taking the time and aim increases not only the accuracy but also the change to score a critical hit. If the player is more of a peaceful and/or sneaky nature, he can however take the stealth-route. This allows him to make one-hit take downs of an unsuspecting enemy as well as avoid many obstacles. Especially sneaking around involves a lot of hacking, lock-picking doors and rerouting electronics to go around enemies, stop alarms or just get additional intel. Each of these tasks involves a small mini-game which increases in difficulty as the player advances through the game.<br><br>Each kill, hack, successful dialogue and completed mission objective earns Mike experience points which in turn allow him to level up and earn advancement points. These are used to upgrade the nine available skills like "Stealth" or "Assault Rifles" up to 10 times. If a skill is completely upgraded, the player can then choose to specialise it, unlocking 5 additional ranks to dumb points in. This can however only be done for three skills. Investing points into a skill unlocks both permanent bonuses like less recoil when using a pistol to special abilities. "Awareness" for example is a stealth-ability which allows the player to see all enemies and which direction they are currently facing even through walls. At higher stealth-ranks, this effect becomes permanent.

Description=Ancients of Ooga is a puzzle platformer that builds on the game mechanics of Cloning Clyde. The game is set in a fantasy world and is centered around creatures known as Ooganis. They ignored the advice of their chiefs and befriended monsters known as the Boolis. As soon as the Boolis were given trust, the Ooganis ate a bunch of intoxicating slugs and became fat and lazy. They locked their chiefs in cages, the Boolis burned them down and then the Ooganis were made slaves of the Boolis. The player controls the Spirit of Ooga, a ghost with the ability to possess any of the Ooganis, and summoned by the few remaining Ooganis that want their freedom back. The entire game is played with the possessed characters and the player can switch to new ones at any time. The spirit needs to visit seven villages and each village is split up into different levels (about 50 in total) with objectives that need to be completed. Generally to move on to a new village the chief needs to be revived.<br><br>Even though most Ooganis have fighting abilities, there is a strong emphasis on puzzle elements, to take out enemies using alternative means or possessing different characters to pull levers, turn wheels or activate pressure plates, or use their unique abilities to spit fire, swim more quickly, call floods, walk on lava or slow down time - having characters work together in the vein of the Lost Viking series even though there is no permanent character that needs to be taken along all the time. Many other abilities are gained by picking up objects and chewing them for temporary storage like an inventory system (but for a single item). This is needed to carry an object (or another character) while climbing a ladder and then puking it out again, but when the object is swallowed it can also restore health or activate abilities. Red peppers make them belch fire, certain fruit puts them to sleep and beans can make them hover. Most items can also be thrown.<br><br>Even though the characters are 3D models it is largely played as a 2D platformer (with a fixed side camera view), with the added ability to move to the front and the back of an area rather than a fixed horizontal path. Pulling the left trigger opens up a map with general directions and an overview of the quests. In the spirit mode the entire environment can be explored freely. Cooperative play is supported for up to two players.

Description=Arkanoid Live! is a modern update of the classic ball bouncing game from the eighties. Player steer a paddle (called the Vaus) left and right at the bottom of the screen to bounce back a ball (there are six bouncing directions). A round is completed by busting all blocks on the screen and the player has to avoid having the ball disappear at the bottom.<br><br>The game offers different modes of play and the main single player mode is divided into four episodes. There is a lives system where the number of lives is reduced when the ball touches the bottom of the screen and a barrier system where the ball can touch a barrier at the bottom of the screen a number of times before it disappears, along with different difficulty levels. Both systems can also be played as multiplayer co-op. In that mode the second player is however more of a helper, as the paddle floats below the one of the first player and it can only catch balls that are missed by the first. There are different types of blocks where each colour holds a different amount of points, blocks that need to be hit multiple times, moving blocks, and blocks that are impenetrable. Optionally enemies can be activated (Obobo, Konerd, Triphere, Pyradok, Klacker, Valion). They float through the screen and need to be hit. There is also a boss level at the end of the game. Certain blocks release bonuses for the Vaus:<br><br>Laser: fire a laser at the blocks, acquiring another one provides a power laser<br>2. Expand: increase the Vaus' size with 50%<br>3. Catch: catch the ball and release it whenever you want<br>4. Slow: slows down the speed of the ball<br>5. Reduce: halves the Vaus' size but gives double points<br>6. Megaball: the ball can break through blocks without bouncing<br>7. Disruption: seven clones of the ball appear (multiball)<br><br>Certain bonuses are only available according to the chosen system:<br><br>1. Lives Rules:<br><br>Break: an escape hatch to the rights open where you can leave the level to complete it<br>8. Thunder: a plasma shield appears below the Vaus to bounce back a lost ball once<br>9.

The captors attach Desmond to a strange device called "Animus", which allows him to access the memory of his ancestor, an assassin named Altar. For some reason, the reconstruction of Altar's memories is vital to the captors.<br><br>After accessing Altar's memory, Desmond is able to experience the events that took place in the Holy Land in the year 1191, the time of the Third Crusade. Al Mualim, the leader of the assassins, orders Altar to kill nine prominent historical figures, who supposedly let war and corruption take over the Holy Land.<br><br>During most of the game, the player controls Altar; however, it is clearly indicated that controlling him is a part of Desmond's experience. The player is also able to control Desmond between his sessions in the "Animus".<br><br>The game's most innovative feature is the freedom of choice and movement. Every architectural detail like window ledges, carvings in the stone or wooden bars can be used to move on the walls. This allows the player to have intense chase scenes if by any chance you're hunted by the guard.<br><br>There are several ways you can reach your goal in the game. Using eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing, you can find out information about your next target. You can then use this information to choose whether you take on the targets by full frontal assault or with a properly placed throwing knife from the cover of the rooftops.<br><br>Depending on your choice, you'll have to deal with the citizens and knights of the cities who will become suspicious of a cloaked person wondering on the rooftops or near the mission targets.

Description=Assassin's Creed II continues exactly where the original left off. The player controls Desmond Miles, and who was connected to the Animus device, allowing him to experience past events in search of a mystical power the Templars were interested in. After the end credits roll in the Assassin's Creed, by going into the Eagle Vision mode in Desmond's room (more of a holding cell, really) a set of strange symbols became visible on the wall. That's where this game starts off.<br><br>One of the scientists asks Desmond to put his trust in her hands and follow her out of the complex. Soon afterwards they escape the holding place and team up with some new allies that don't seem to force him as his previous captors did. Their new device is called Animus 2.0 and is an upgraded version of the original device that let him experience past events. This time, he will go back to Italy in the 15th century.<br><br>Unlike the prior game, Desmond and the player will get to know the past-event character quite well before he puts on a cloak and hood. His name's Ezio Auditore di Firenze, a sly little rascal who likes to pick fights and chase skirts, but all that changes when his father and little brother are publicly executed by the man he trusted.<br><br>This game provides a learning curve that will go equally well for new players and those who played the original game. Although most of the moves stayed the same, the game comes with a plethora of new offerings. For starters, there are many weapons in the game: weapons one can pick up from enemies (even though they cannot be carried permanently, unless purchased in the armory). Ezio can carry a sword-type weapon, a dagger-type weapon, throwing knives, smoke bombs, a pistol, and a bunch of upgradeable armour (you can even unlock Altair's armour which does not require any repairing, unlike any other armor in the game).<br><br>Jumping on the roofs, escaping the angry guards, taking a leap of faith, riding a horse and climbing to virtually any point one can see is all there from the original. On top of that, there are chariot chases, swimming, or even flying using one of Leonardo's inventions (yup, Leonardo da Vinci is a very good friend in this game). With a stealth approach, one can use courtesans to distract the guards or to help Ezio blend in. Mercenaries can be hired to help in fighting guards; thieves can be commissioned to create a distraction... one can always just go guns blazing and fight one's way up to becoming notorious and making any guard attack on sight.<br><br>The travels in the past take place in 15th century Italy, namely to Florence, Venice, Rome and more. A lot of lying gold chests and sub-quests significantly add to gameplay time, but most of the quests are not obligatory in order to reach the game's ultimate goal. The game is mostly in 3rd-person perspective but lets the player switch to 1st-person view virtually anywhere.

Along the way, there are also items that periodically appear, and whoever grabs them can use them to attack the other players, such as by shrinking them or freezing them in place temporarily. Each player also has a limited boost meter which can be used to either move quickly to the sides or to jump, and will refill when not in use. The game ends when a player collects the golden milkshake, which is worth a points bonus but does not decide the winner outright.

The player's avatar is constantly running down a river on the top of the water, and there are two bars to keep track of. The red bar is the rhythm bar, and the player must continually press the A button to keep it filled. The blue bar is the focus bar, which goes down when the player hits an obstacle, and will slowly refill over time. The lower the focus bar is, the faster the A button must be pressed to fill the rhythm bar, and if the rhythm bar empties, the game is over.<br><br>There are several types of obstacles along the way. Logs must be jumped over with X, bombs must be slid under with B, and targets must be shot down with a shuriken using Y. There are also many coins that that must be collected for points, as well as several ninja magic powers the can be collected to give an ability like a focus boost or shield.

Description=Baja: Edge of Control is an off-road racing game based on the real-life Baja 1000 race series held in California. The tracks are set in a desert environment and there's over 1000 miles of route to explore. In the main career mode, the idea is to start at the bottom class of off-road racing with a VW Beetle. By performing well in races, players earn prize & sponsorship money and experience points to buy better machines and unlock higher classes. In order to secure the sponsorship money, their logos must still be on the car at the end of the race, so too much damage to the car will result in the player not getting paid. The vehicles can be tuned and modified to increase performance.<br><br>There are five different race modes; circuit which is a standard race where you do a few laps of a track against opponents, rally which a point to point time-trial, hill climb which as it suggests is drive up a steep hill, and then back down, open class where different categories of car race against each other with a handicap system in place to disadvantage the more powerful ones and Baja which is an endurance race lasting between 250-1000 miles. The Baja mode races can last up to several hours.

On the side of the other members of Bad Company, the player tries to fulfill the various objectives of the missions while gunning down several dozens enemies using a huge arsenal of real-world military equipment but limited to only carrying two main weapons and a side-arm at the same time. During the course of the game, the player unlocks new weapons by finding them during his missions, granting him the ability to equip them from then on at every supply drop.<br><br>As in previous installments of the Battlefield series, the core of the game is again the class-based and team-based multiplayer for up to 32 players, divided into squads with four men each. Four game modes are available: Rush, Conquest, Squad-Rush and Squad-Deathmatch. Each mode can also be played on "Hardcore"-difficulty, deactivating the cross-hair, the mini-map and such. The four modes in detail:<br><br>1. Rush requires the two teams, Russians and Americans, to either defend or destroy mobile transmitters. Once the attacking team successfully destroys one, the battlefield is expanded and the fight moves on to the next transmitter.<br>2. Conquest is once again all about capturing and holding flags.<br>3. Squad-Rush has two squads fighting for two mobile transmitters at the same time.<br>4. Squad-Deathmatch pits squads against each other with the winner being the squad that scores the most kills.<br><br> The available classes are Assault, Engineer, Medic and Recon. Each class has their own set of weapons and gadgets. While the Engineer has his repair torch to repair tanks and other machinery, the Medic uses his Defibrillator to revive fallen team members and prevent the loss of a ticket. Each class gets access to new weapons and equipment by leveling up. The players get experience points for killing people, capturing flags, fulfilling objectives and earning achievements like killing 7 enemies in one round with a light machine gun. Additional points are gained, if the player interacts with one of his current squad-mates. With these experience points, the player levels both up his class to unlock new stuff as well as his overall rank.<br><br>Although the game is very infantry-heavy, vehicles like bikes, tanks or helicopters stand ready to be used in the fight. Tanks are especially useful to take full advantage of the so-called Destruction 2.0 system, which allow the players to take down whole buildings if enough fire power is used. The health system is a mix of using med-packs and automatic healing. If a player still dies and isn't resurrected by a Medic, he can either choose to respawn at a stationary points like the home base or captured flags, or use one of his squad-mates as an entry point.

Description=Battleship is one of the launch games of the downloadable XBLA version of Hasbro Family Game Night. It can only be played through Hasbro Family Game Night, which is offered as a free application. It is also included in the retail version of the game. Hosted by Hasbro's Mr. Potato Head, the game can be selected from a game room. The room can be browsed and holds trophies collected while playing. Each game comes with included hints. There are also different background themes to choose from.<br><br>The game is a conversion of the classic board game. Players place a fleet of ships on a board (a 10x10 grid) and an opponent does the same, without seeing the location of each other's ships. Players then take turns firing at the grid to try and locate the ship. During the placement ships can be rotated with a key and there is also an option to auto deploy all of them. The game offers three modes:<br><br>1. Original: classic rules, players take turns firing a single shot.<br><br>2. Salvo: players can fire as many shots as there are ships left. So five shots per turn in the beginning, and less when some of the player's ship are sunk, based on the fleet count.<br><br>3. Super Weapons is very different and borrows many elements from the Electronic Battleship Advanced Mission board game to introduce more strategy. There are reinforcements with a small patrol boat, lucky shots (can take out an entire ship when they hit), heavy shots (target five squares at once), decoys (show a random hit or miss, regardless of the actual situation), torpedoes (travel through an entire column until they hit a ship), and random power-ups.<br><br>Next to those main modes there is a custom mode where individual features can be enabled. There are three difficulty levels, and multiplayer is available locally and through Xbox Live.

You are late for duty and on route to your ship as the Japanese attack the harbor and sink it. Now you first help to defend the harbor and then take the fight all the way to the last Battle of the pacific around the Midway Islands.<br><br>You are limited to control the ships, subs and planes the game gives you in the single-player campaign but in multiplayer-matches you are free to jump into anything that moves and isn't currently occupied by another player. So it's yours to decide at anytime if you want to fly a plane, steer a cruiser or take the on the enemy under water with a submarine anytime you like. Since there are several kinds of ships from Torpedo Boats over Destroyers to Aircraft Carriers and planes like the F4F Wildcat or the SBD Dauntless you have different options and weapons at your disposal. On a Aircraft Carrier for example, which has only AA guns, you can build up squads of airplanes, assign targets and launch them. You can also go to the tactical map if you currently controlling a ship and assign formations, give out orders and so on. Or just jump into a vehicle and do everything yourself instead of letting the AI or the other players take care of it.<br><br>The single-player also features three different challenges, one for each type of vehicle. Each mission inside a challenge puts you in difficult situations you've to master. The first mission in the ship challenge for example gives you control over a Japanese Battleship which has been ambushed and needs to reach safety as US Destroyers advance at it's position.

Description=Battlestations: Pacific is the successor to Battlestations: Midway and once again pits Japanese against Americans. Two single-player campaigns await the player with one picturing the Japanese starting at the attack on Pearl Harbor and the American campaign following the aftermath of the the Battle for Midway.<br><br>Similar to the Battlefield series the game puts the player right in the middle of the battle, always surrounded by AI-units filling up the free spots. But instead of fighting on foot, the players only use several different kinds of battleships, u-boats and airplanes. These are launched by the players at their team's HQ and can be equipped with different weapon load-outs. Depending e.g. on the type of the airplane (bomber, fighter or such), these range from MGs over rockets and bombs to carpet bombs and paratroopers. Of course once the support bar reaches zero, no more units can be launched.<br><br>Besides players doing all the work while sitting in a unit, the commander can also use the tactical map to assign formations, give out orders to the AI as well as other players and so on. This is also the place where the players choose in which unit they want to jump in. Each type of unit also plays radically different. While airplanes concentrate on fast dogfights and low bomb-droppings, ships are slow but can repair themselves. U-Boats on the other hand have the ability to dive and disappear from every enemies radar. To compensate for that, U-Boats not only have a limited supply of oxygen but can also be spotted by sonar and killed with water-bombs.<br><br>Besides the campaigns, the game also features five skirmish-modes for both single- and multiplayer. In "Escort" both teams have to defend key units from the enemy while themselves attacking and destroying the enemies key units with every player using a pre-defined unit. "Siege" on the other hand one team has to attack a island or coastline with the other team defending it. This time each player can choose his own unit from an available pool of units. "Competition" again has all the players only controlling one unit but fight on the same side in an effort to destroy as many AI-enemies as possible or completing the objectives. In "Duel" the players choose their unit before each mission and have to destroy all enemy units to win the round. And last but not least "Island Conquest" requires the capturing of control points to both win the match and gain access to additional units.

Description=Beat Hazard is a single screen arena shooter where the behaviour of enemies, gameplay and visual effects are dynamically adapted based on the chosen soundtrack. Just like Audiosurf about any custom music track can be imported to alter the game experience. Players control a small ship and need to survive waves of enemies. Only one level is provided, but the ship's firepower and the opponents dynamically change by analysing the music. During slow sections the ship's weapon is very weak and only a few enemies appear. When the rhythm and beat is built up, the weapon will gradually slow stronger, ending in large gushes of lasers (the beat hazard weapon) with different colours and visuals flashing along with the beat. At that point larger ships often appear and they can take a lot of damage before exploding. Players do not need to match the music in any way contrary to other games where the gameplay is centered around sound.<br><br>Defeated enemies, and objects such as rocks and space debris leave behind a number of modifiers that remain persistent regardless of the changes in the music. These include power-ups that increase the sound volume or raise the ship's firing power, provide bombs that clear the entire screen, or grant score multipliers. Multipliers are also awarded by not firing for five seconds (Dare Devil) and every 30 seconds that are survived (Survivor). When the ship is destroyed all upgrades are lost and generally a few more tries are provided before the game ends. There are three difficulty modes and a survivor game mode along with sessions that consist of single tracks and where multipliers are gradually dropped. The overall score is stored across sessions and moving up ranks opens up starting bonuses and provides other types of benefits. The gameplay works best with tracks that have a consistent and fast-paced rhythm. Slow songs generally numb the experience through a lack of firing power and enemies. An online leaderboard is also included.

Description=The official game of the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, Beijing 2008 features 32 national teams in 38 events for both men and women on a varied number of disciplines, played in truthful representations of the stadiums that hosted the real Games in the summer of 2008 such as the Birds' Nest or the Watercube.<br><br>As usual with games in this genre (some events play in a particular similar fashion to Athens 2004), button mashing and timing makes up the core of the gameplay, with some exceptions and novel ideas. In now-classic events such as sprinting running and swimming, instead of mashing the power buttons as soon as the starting pistol is heard, the player has to control a bar with the trigger buttons, where the player jumps from the blocks when it is completely filled and has to be careful not to fill the bar too soon (resulting in a false start) or too late (losing precious time). Other events also have their share of gameplay innovations in the genre, such as the Javelin, where the analogue stick is used to set the throw and accurately define the angle accurately. <br>In the most off-beat events, diving and rings requires the player to follow the on-screen cue with the analogue pads, while others such as the the floor exercise and beam require the player to follow the button queues - there are three difficulty levels, mostly changing the looseness of the timing - in higher levels, the player will have a much harder time hitting "perfect" moves and some of them will require much faster combinations.<br><br>One of the most novel events is Judo, where the player must react quickly to the on-screen cues in order to gain advantage during the grappling phase - once there's an opening chance for an attack, the player can press one button to initiate a throw, and if the mis-match was large enough (a "Perfect" against a "Very Good" won't allow for an Ippon throw, and the defending player with block the attack, starting another grappling sequence). The player being thrown must bash the appropriate button to decrease the power bar to avoid being projected with his back down, which would result on an Ippon and instant defeat. While an Ippon decides the match instantly, two Waza-ari also decide, with the lowest scores (Koka and Yuko) usually deciding matches stopped by the clock. The player can also choose to do a choke or lock move, where both players must press the triggers, and unless the defending player does not break the lock in a limited time frame, he concedes an Ippon and loses the match.<br>Table Tennis also makes an appearance, and is an event where the player must be properly placed to respond with either a well-timed normal or backspin shot, the timing defining the accuracy of the shot. Good returns fill a power bar, and once it's filled, the player can do a particularly vicious shot that when well executed is nearly impossible to return - however, being able to return these shots becomes the essence of each set, same with doing perfect serves.<br><br>Game modes include practice, regular competition (where the player can select or deselect each event, for men and women), random events, Decathlon or Heptathlon and of course, the Olympics. While in previous games the Olympics were usually just a set of events, in Beijing 2008 they are much more complex, and feature a game where the player must complete a number of challenges each day with the difficulty level and number of necessary successes increasing progressively. While in the other modes there is a slight slowdown during the technical parts of the events, in Olympic the player must assign points to it, and trigger when required. The player also needs to assign points to other key areas, such as speed, technique or accuracy. Failing to reach the goal for the day forces the player to load the game and try again.

He can also slide and fight with his fists. <br><br>His most important tool however is the Omnitrix. Through this device he can eventually transform in up to ten different alien forms. They have their own health and a unique fighting style with a primary and a secondary attack. The included aliens are Swampfire, Brainstorm, Big Chill, Humungousaur, Echo Echo, Chromastone, Jetray, Spider Monkey, Goop, and Lodestar. Each alien also has a special ability. Swampfire can grow plants to reach higher areas for instance, while Brainstorm can send out an electrical shock to enable or disable mechanical equipment. Morphing can be done at any time without restrictions and many of the abilities need to be used to solve minor puzzles.

Description=Beowulf: The Game is a hack-and-slash game based on Robert Zemeckis' animated movie adaptation of the poem Beowulf. Gameplay combines elements from the Tomb Raider and God of War series.<br><br>As Beowulf, the player fights his way through a number of episodes commanding his band of merry Thanes via a small selection of commands. Beowulf can chant with his band to boost the morale and max out damage out, triggered through a rhythm button mashing mini-game. There are more mini-games similar to the chanting throughout the game. Some appear right in the middle of combat while trying to grapple a large monster similar to sequences in God of War.<br><br>Beowulf can lift enemies with brute strength and hurl them in any direction, even at other enemies. He can also alternate weapons by picking up new ones, lying discarded on the ground, or from racks of weapons that may be found in many places. Also in combat Beowulf can enter Carnal Mode that increases his strength but demoralizes Thanes, so players won't be able to use it frequently or the entire kingdom will be sad and dismal. In certain areas the player needs to find a path to continue, sometimes by climbing walls and grabbing small ledges. All characters are voiced by the original actors who starred in the film.

Description=It has been ten years since Nathan "RAD" Spencer managed to defeat the Imperials and destroy the Albatross in Bionic Commando. Hailed as heroes he and his comrade Joseph "Super Joe" Gibson became responsible for the training of new recruits under the flag of the TASC. But when Spencer disobeyed an order from Gibson during Operation Blackout, which lead to the death of several TASC agents, Spencer was court-martialed and sentenced to death while through his actions the public changed its opinion about bionic technology leading to the cancellation of the program and the "Bionic Purge". During the purge all TASC personnel were ordered to turn in their bionics or have them forcibly removed. Some fled, others obeyed but in the end bionic technology was effectively removed from the nation - at least until terrorists from BioReign detonate an atomic bomb in Ascension City. With no military unit returning from Ground Zero once gone in, Nathan is spared his fate for now and is instead send in to deal with the situation under the promise to get new information about the where-abouts of his missing wife Emily.<br><br>In a classic 3rd-person-shooter-style, the player moves through the destroyed city, fulfilling objectives like activating a relay station and thereby deactivating a minefield and killing the countless enemies (including mechs and other deadly vehicles) blocking his way. Literally always at his side: his Bionic Arm. While it can be used to just throw a nasty punch, the built-in grappling hook is the real clue on that device. It not only allows the player to swing around fast and even climb up the highest skyscraper, it's also a handy tool to get rid of enemies and for removing other annoying obstacles. At the same time Nathan also can use normal weapons with his right hands like pistols or grenades. Besides BioReign-forces, the environment itself is also an enemy to Nathan with radioactive zones killing him almost instantly. And due to the weight of his Bionic Arm, Nathan can't swim and will drown when he falls into water.<br><br>To keep things interesting, the game features both collectibles and challenges. While the collectibles are simply hidden in the levels, challenges are offered once the player has done something, gains a new ability and such. The goals of these challenges include killing 25 enemies, making three consecutive swings or destroying three train wagons. Once a challenge has been met, the player immediately gains a bonus like better armor and often gets the same challenge again - only this time with increased requirements.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer-mode for up to eight player featuring Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch and Capture the Flag on small, mostly vertical maps allowing the players to make full use of the Bionic Arm the same way as in single-player.

Description=Bionic Commando Rearmed is a remake of original Bionic Commando for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The visuals are updated to the year 2008's standards and it remains quite faithful to the gameplay and general mission structure of the 1989 game. It should be noted that the game remade is the North American release, so no Nazi symbols or references can be seen in the remake.<br><br>There are however a number of additions never seen in the original. The first is the ability to play the game completely through the co-op mode and a plethora of various multiplayer modes. Another one is the completely reworked boss battles that change their AI to accommodate for a second player. Some enemies are now more vulnerable to a particular weapon type while others barely scratch them.<br><br>The remake also sees an appearance of challenge rooms that must completed without touching the floor once. This can be done using the bionic arm, which the player can use to swing around. Those events are optional and time based. Hacking now includes solving a 3D puzzle in something resembling a cyberspace. Completing those puzzles is optional, however it may provide a hint as how to destroy the boss on the current level.

Description=BioShock is considered the spiritual successor of System Shock 2 and mixes first-person shooting with role-playing elements. In the year 1960 a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with you as the only survivor. You have the apparent luck of resurfacing in front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating, you enter the door and soon you are taught that this is the city of Rapture, a paradise of free will build in the 40s by Andrew Ryan, visually and socially inspired by objectivism of Ayn Rand. However, even before you assimilate all this new information, the descent to this supposed paradise ends and you only see ruins and chaos. Learning about the destiny of Rapture will be now your main motivation while you have to survive to the horrors that the free will can create.<br><br>A sci-fi plot based on a social system that fails is not the only thing BioShock shares with it predecessor, as many features of its gameplay and even elements of Rapture are easily recognizable in SS2. Bioshock is an FPS, but with many elements that make the gameplay more complex than just shooting your enemies while advancing in the game. In addition to the usual, and not so usual, fire and melee weapons, the main character can use "plasmids", genetic tools created in Rapture that can give superpowers, like telekinesis or fire throwing, to those who use them. The enemies are also more complex, in the sense that they do not always go after your character to kill him. Most of them are inhabitants of Rapture, victims of the bizarre experiments performed in the city and empowered themselves with plasmids. There are also security devices that you can use for your advantage or creatures with symbiotic relationships like the "Big Daddies" and the "Little Sisters" and many others to be discovered. All of these features and some abilities of interaction with the surrounding give the player many ways of facing each situation.<br><br>The entire game takes place in an underwater setting using an improved Vengeance engine, a heavily modified version of UnrealEngine3. Rapture is in ruins, you can see that everywhere you go and water is the key to all this. Water is what surrounds you and the city all the time and what slowly devours it with you inside. The water also helps building the dark atmosphere of Rapture the same way genetic engineering (and underwater architecture) helps establishing the sci-fi bases of the plot. Both, the setting and the plot are completed with many 50s furniture and propaganda,  la the Fallout series.<br><br>The Xbox 360 and Windows version were released simultaneously. A PS3 port was only announced afterwards and was released more than a year later. There are no graphical improvements, except for the "horizontal plus" widescreen option that was introduced through a Xbox 360 patch. The cut-scenes are also in a higher resolution. A new addition is the Survivor Mode with a harder difficulty level.

Description=Ten years have passed since the events in BioShock. The underwater-city Rapture has further deteriorated, with water breaking in everywhere and whole sections flooded by water. But as bad as the situation is, the city still isnt empty. After Andrew Ryans death, his long adversary, the psychiatrist Dr. Sophia Lamb took over the helm  embracing her own cult, making the mutated splicers that roam the city her worshippers. In the middle is Delta, the first of the protectors of the Little Sisters better known as Big Daddies. Eternally bonded to one and only one Little Sister called Eleanor, daughter of Sophia Lamb, hes damned to search the city and find her or die trying.<br><br>The player slips into the mighty boots of Delta, making his way in a typical first-person-shooter-style through the city of Rapture to find and confront Dr. Sophia Lamb, who holds Eleanor against her will. The switch of perspective, in the first game the player was a normal human, also brings with it a few changes in gameplay. The most important being, that the player can now use both one of the eleven available plasmids and one of the several different weapons at the same time, allowing him to burn enemies while pumping them full of bullets. Other plasmids include Winter Blast which freezes an enemy or Scout which allows the player to leave his body and look around unnoticed. The weapons on the hand range from the famous Big-Daddy-Drill over a powerful double-barrel-shotgun to a grenade launcher.<br><br>As in the first game, both weapons and plasmids are upgradeable. While the weapons just require the player to find a special workstation, upgrades for plasmids and tonics (granting passive effects) are bought at special vending machines called Gatherers Garden with the rare substance called Adam. As in the first game, the Little Sisters roaming the levels are the key to getting access to Adam. But since the player himself is a Big Daddy, the process is a bit different this time around. While the player still needs to kill the accompanying Big Daddy to get access to the Little Sister, he can choose to adopt it afterwards instead of just harvesting it. The Little Sister will then sit on his shoulder and look for Adam-infused bodies in the level to harvest them.<br><br>Setting down a Little Sister to harvest a body will unleash hell as every splicer in the level will try to kill her, requiring the player to protect the little girl from harm until its finished collecting. Once a Little Sister has harvested two bodies, the player can again either harvest her himself, or free her. Either action grants him more or less Adam and at the same time may alert a Big Sister. As opposed to the Big Daddies, they are nimble, fast and very deadly.<br><br>Another important change is the new hacking-mini-game which is the same in all versions now and requires the player to hit the green or blue spaces on a gauge with a constantly spinning needle. If he doesnt hit the right field, he either gets a electro-shock or will sound the alarm. A successful hack on the other will lower the prices at vending machines or turn turrets over to the players side. The new mini-game also allows the player to fight and walk around while hacking as well as hacking from a distance thanks to the arrows shot by the hacking-tool.<br><br>BioShock 2 features multiplayer for up to 10 players which was developed independently from the single player by a different developer and tells the story before the first game. By gaining ranks for kills and winning matches, the player unlocks access to additional radio messages advancing the story behind the civil war that raged in the city between the Splicers and Andrew Ryans security force. The available multiplayer-mode include Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture and Hold, Capture the Sister and Adam Grab. The latter requires the players to collect and protect the sole Little Sister in the level in order to gain points. Capture the Sister on the other hand puts two teams against each other with one team trying to bring the Little Sister to a vent and the other trying to prevent that. Each mode also features the possibility of one player slipping into the role of a Big Daddy.

This hub area also serves as a meeting place for characters from the game world and the player may gleam information from gossip heard that will help them later in-game.

Battles are a simple hack and slash affair, with the player attempting to clear the area of enemy troops. Once this has been achieved a base commander will appear at the base under siege. Beat this commander and the player will have seized the territory and completed the mission. Extra fame can be achieved from beating in combat the VIP enemies found throughout the mission. This in turn will also yield treasure for the player, some of which is collectible throughout the game.<br><br>As such, Bladestorm has no end - the player will continue to fight battles as they progress (This is after all the Hundred Years' War!), but there is a story arc within the game to be completed, and the amount of missions - although very similar can give players a lot game content to keep them happy.

Description=Blaster and Amethyst is a simple top-down shooting game. Each stage contains seven amethyst crystals, and the player must collect them all to open the gate to the next stage. Making this more difficult are the swarms of buglike monsters populating each stage. They will attack and shoot at the player, and while no attacks will do direct damage, they will cause the player to fly wildly, easily careening off the edge of the stage. The player has a blaster with which to ward off enemies, but this also only pushes them around and off the stage. The player is awarded with a time bonus for remaining time at the end of each stage, and there are seven stages total.

Description=Blaster and Morion is a sci-fi themed twin stick shooter, and the sequel to Blaster and Amethyst. Playing much like its predecessor, the goal of each of the seven stages is to blast enemies off the stage, collect all seven crystals, and reach the exit before the timer runs out and without falling off the stage. As before, contact with enemies or enemy fire is not directly harmful, but will cause the character to fly backwards a good distance, and likely off the stage to his death.

In addition to the modes from the original game, these have been supplemented with the two new game-modes "Capture the Flag" and "Epic Battle". In "Epic Battle" two teams over control of a map.

Description=Blazing Angels is an air combat arcade game putting the player at the command of a fighter squadron in the Second World War. It's a pick-up-and-play type of game, with easy-to-grasp controls and an almost non existent learning curve.<br><br>The action covers the most important moments of the WWII, from the Battle for England to the bombing raids over Berlin, but also warps a bit the history to make for some entertaining if fictitious moments (i.e. you get to fly over Normandy on D-Day, save the day at Pearl Harbor, etc). The gameplay is quite varied, with about 18 flyable planes during the SP campaign (fighters, recon planes, dive, torpedo and level bombers) and diverse tasks and locations that prevent the game from being overly repetitive, despite a general dogfighting approach. The basic squadron command system and the specific abilities of the wingmen lend a bit of a tactical flavor to the game.<br><br>There are a dozen multiplayer game modes available: solo (Dogfight, Seek and Destroy & Aces High), co-op (Dogfight, Onslaught, Bombing Run, Kamikaze and Historical Missions) and squad-based (Dogfight, Capture the Base, Bombing Run and Kamikaze).

Description=Blazing Birds was one of the 2007 Dream-Build-Play contest winners and it pits robots from different countries against each other in a futuristic take on badminton. Played from a side-view with a 2D plane the robots can only move left or right with a net in the middle, there is also only one robot on each side. The game loosely follows the rules of badminton. The robots need to hit a shuttlecock (called a bird in the game) over the net. Scoring can only be done from a serving position. It can be hit soft (close), medium (in the middle) or hard (far) to make the opponent drop it, along with an auto shot. Auto shots deplete a battery that needs to recharged, so it can't be used all the time. In addition advanced players can use manual aiming to make the shots more precise.<br><br>The player can track the position of the bird through an arrow to shows where it will land. When an incoming bird is above the smash line and the robot is below, a smash can be performed. Games consist of eleven points with two points in overtime. To spice it up a Shot Bot hovers over the net and it often contains power-ups. When the player hits the bird through it, it can unleash a shot represented as a giant dragon or a confusing purple shot that ricochets off walls.<br><br>There is an Arcade mode with 20 AI opponents, three difficulty levels, an Elimination mode (sudden death) and a local multiplayer mode for two players.

Description=Blitz: The League is the first football game with no NFL license in many years - because EA signed an exclusive deal with the NFL, Midway developed one without the license. The game has 17 fantasy teams all with their own look and feel - from personalities to logos. <br><br>The game differentiates itself further from official games by giving the players an off-field presence, often involving sex, performance-enhancing drugs and violence. The game has input from the writer for Playmakers, the football-based soap opera the NFL forced ESPN to cancel.<br><br>Blitz: The League has 8-man teams, and makes spectacular action-packed moves easier than in real life. Impressive moves boost your Clash meter, which allows you to pull off unrealistic moves, such as easier running due to Bullet Time, and some brutally tough defences tackles. If these tackles happen frequently enough the players will fight hockey-style, lunging into wild tackles. The team with the most tackles from this gains the Unleashed mode, which has even more gruesome moves, of a style the NFL would not allow to be associated with their product.<br><br>Additional features include multiplayer action with head-to-head online play and complete customization options of players, teams, stadiums and more. Lawrence Taylor appears as the poster boy.

Injuries are still present with enhanced and realistic graphics showing broken bones and tearing tissue through x-rays of the players bodies at the moment of impact.<br><br>One new feature is the ability to pin point the location of an opposing players body they wish to hit, the larger the area the greater the chances they will hit, but the smaller will have the player use precision timing but will have greater results in creating a devastating injury.<br><br>There is also online capabilities where players can connect through their respective service in quick versus matches against friends or engage in an online campaign-mode as well as downloadable content.

Description=Blood Bowl is an official video game adaptation of the table-top game of the same name but is not a remake of the first Blood Bowl. Instead the game is the in-official successor to Chaos League: Sudden Death and builds upon its features.<br><br>Based on the Living Rulebook 5.0 ruleset, Blood Bowl is a dark fantasy version of American Football with 11 players per team beating each other to death in order to get a touchdown. The game features eighth races with different strength and weaknesses including the fast but weak Goblins, the flexible but mediocre Humans and the powerful but slow Orcs. The player can either play fast games with pre-defined teams or enter the heart of the game: the campaign. In the campaign the player creates a new team from scratch trying to bring it up to the top of the ranking of the current Blood Bowl-season. To accomplish this goal the player has to buy players with different attributes and skills, close sponsor contracts to earn additional money and decide how to influence the upcoming game by bribing the referee, buying potions for his team and other illegal activities. His players also gain experience points during a match especially for scoring touchdowns or by downing enemy players. Once they gain a level up, they can learn an additional skill like blocking.<br><br>Once the team stands, the game begins with the option to play either in real-time- or turn-based-mode. The turn-based-mode is very close to the table-top game with 8 rounds per half-time, turnover-events and manual dice rolls. Although the real-time-mode also features dice rolls, they are done behind the players backs and the outcome of each action is determined by one or more skill checks. The game grid is also still divided into squares but these are invisible now. The most important difference is that in real-time-mode the player can give orders to more than one player at all times and other elements like turnover-events are removed. If the player still needs time to think about his moves, he can activate the concentration mode which pauses the game and allows him to give orders without pressure.<br><br>The game features several multiplayer-modes including hot seat in which two players can play on one machine in turn-based-mode against each other and worldwide open and private online-leagues for which the players are able to create up to 32 teams.

Description=Bloody Good Time is a multiplayer first person shooter taking place on a Hollywood movie set. The crazy Director X is casting for a new movie and has invited eight aspiring actors to his studio. The player takes control of one of these actors and has to perform well enough to earn the leading role. Soon he will find out that the director's unusual casting methods are not just about getting the role but to stay alive.<br><br>The gameplay is similar to Outerlight's previous game, The Ship. A game consists of a number of scenes. There are four main types of scenes (game modes) and four types of bonus scenes. In most of these scenes, each player has a quarry that he has to hunt down and kill. Of course, at the same time he has to watch out for his own hunter. Normally the identity of the hunter is not known so the player has to pay attention to what the other players are doing. By performing well the player earns fame and the one with most fame at the end wins the game.<br><br>Before the killing can begin the player needs to pick up some equipment. There are two kinds of items in Bloody Good Time: weapons and murder aids. Weapons range from melee weapons such as axes and frying pans to ranged weapons such as stun guns and flamethrowers. Each weapon has a star rating which represents how much fame the player will get for using it to kill his quarry. Murder aids can be used to enhance the player's abilities or decrease those of the opponents. Another way to kill the quarry is to activate one of the many traps that the director has set up around the sets. <br><br>The player has three needs that has to be dealt with. These are fatigue, relief and hunger. When the fatigue is low the player become slower and has to find something to rest in. A low relief leads to less damage resistance until the player finds a toilet. The player also has to eat or he will lose his strength. Whenever the player is doing his needs his hunter can do an insta-kill with no chance of defence. The player also has to watch out for security cameras and guards. If they see any crimes being committed they will start chasing and fine any culprit they might catch. The crimes that can be committed are possession of a weapon, theft, murder and escaping security.

Description=Blur is an action-oriented racing game very similar to the Mario Kart series. But instead of driving on go-carts through colorful environments shooting bananas and turtle shells, the game features dozens of licensed sports-cars from several different manufacturers including the Audi Quattro, the Nissan 350Z and the Shelby GT-500 racing around fantasy and real-world tracks. <br><br>Scattered around these tracks are three different types of power-ups including a repair kit and a shield as well as five different weapons, like the target-seeking Shunt, which of course are used to get rid of the competition. To that end, each car is very unique in its statistics like strength, acceleration and such, making it a very tactical decision which one to use for the different types of races and tracks. The events include normal races with and without power-ups as well as pure destruction focused ones either taking place in specially build arenas or on normal race tracks.<br><br>The core of the game is the single-player campaign. Divided into nine groups and taking place at over 14 different real-world locations, the player has to make his way to the top. Each group includes several different events including a boss fight. If the player wins the latter, he earns their cars including the unique mods and finishing. To unlock new events and groups, the player has to earn lights - up to seven for each event. While he gets five lights for taking first place, the final two can only be obtained by pleasing the fans.<br><br>Each event features a Fan Target and a Fan Run. Fan Runs are mini-challenges which are activated during a race and require the player to drive through a series of glowing arcs - while the normal race still continues. Besides a bonus light, this will also earn him additional fans. The rest of the fans which are needed to reach the Fan Target are "collected" by shooting and destroying other cars or by impressing with cool driving skills like making drifts or long jumps and such.<br><br>The game also offers a multiplayer mode for up to four players on one machine or up to 20 online. While offline multiplayer only allows the players to choose from all the available cars, online multiplayer offers unlockable car upgrades and mods. In addition the player advances in rank by winning events. Once he reaches level 50, he can choose to enter Legendary mode. Similar to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the player then loses all his accomplishments and is reset to rank 1 but earns an exclusive Legendary car for doing so. This reset can be done up to ten times.

Description=Braid is a puzzle game disguised as a 2D platformer. The player controls Tim during his search for a princess he has known and lost. Although the objective appears to be rather straightforward at first, the meaning and the motives become much more implicit and are interwoven with the mechanics during the course of the game. From a main hub, Tim can eventually access six worlds that consist of different areas. The start of each world reveals a part of the Tim's background and emotions, rather than progressing a storyline. The second to the sixth world can be entirely explored without solving all the puzzles. Difficult situations can be ignored and revisited later. When all worlds have been completed, the first one becomes available and brings closure to the story.<br><br>The game's concept is entirely based around time manipulation. Tim cannot die permanently as the player can rewind time at any moment and usually for any length, even all the way back when an area was entered. While rewinding, the music is synchronized in a similar fashion. Rather than a gimmick, rewinding is an essential element to solve the puzzles. The different worlds give a spin to the mechanic by introducing clones as the player collaborates in a parallel reality with a past version of himself, time can be affected through the movement direction, and Tim can create a circular area to cause time dilation. Certain items, enemies and parts of the scenery are immune to time manipulation or behave in a very different way. Puzzles require close examination of the environment and the behaviour of different items and enemies. As such, the game is entirely about solving the puzzle theoretically by applying the game mechanics and then using trial and error to executive it and discover possible flaws in the proposed logic. This also brings limited replayability to the game.<br><br>A world is solved by collecting the puzzle pieces. These need to be arranged and eventually show a picture related to the game's story. There is no filler in the level design, meaning that every platform, item or game element (except for a few enemies) has a specific purpose to solve a puzzle. Fast times can be tracked in a separate speedrun mode.<br><br>The later released Windows and Macintosh versions are identical, but come with a level editor.

Description=Brave is a young native American boy who lives in the forest. As he wants to become a warrior, the elderly shaman Grey Bear prepares an adventure and hides carvings that will grant him new skills. During the search, however, the village is brutally attacked by the demonic creature Wendigo. Brave is the only one who can defeat it, but in order to do that, he has to track the path of the mysterious shaman Spirit Dancer, discover his past, and find the means to defeat the evil force.<br><br>Brave is a 3D third-person platformer with puzzles. Set in worlds with different themes (ice world, volcanic world, wastelands, forest...), Brave can roam freely, but certain parts are only opened up after solving quests. The boy can jump, duck, climb, and do basic attack moves. While observing, for certain actions, and when using ranged weapons, a first-person view is available as well. During the adventure, Brave acquires new abilities, which allow him to track creatures by smell or their tracks, mimic animals' sounds to lure or distract them, summon creatures, or invoke shaman powers to become an animal (an eagle, a bear, a rabbit and even a skunk). Health is acquired by killing animals or destroying vegetation. Brave can also collect up to five eagle feathers, which allow him to stock up on shaman power that provides superior strength for a short time.<br><br>The exploration gameplay has been mixed with action sequences, where you canoe down river rapids, or ride on a buffalo or an eagle while fighting. There is a strong emphasis on movement and platform-jumping, and there is an adjustable difficulty level, reflected in the amount of hints Grey Bear provides through a "mobile stone". Next to the abilities, there are different weapons to be found, such as spears, tomahawks and bows. Additionally, Brave can search for secret totems that open up concept art in the menu.

It's full of jokes and quotes taken from all over the rich RPG history. Gameplay is standard RPG fare for the most part, with random encounters, dungeon crawls, boss encounters and more. There is a difference however to how the level building works. When the character reaches a new level, the player gets to choose between two options with different stat increases (usually strength and health versus mind and magic points) in a branching way. This means that once a choice is made, that same stat or magic will become unavailable for the rest of the game. The next time the character gains a level, two new options will be available instead.<br><br>The game's duration is roughly 4-6 hours and there are two difficulty settings as well as a Score mode to add some replayability. The game keeps track of various statistics during play, and they can be viewed as an epitaph on a tomb stone from the main menu.

Description=Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway is the third installment of the Brother in Arms series and takes place four months after "Operation Overlord".<br><br>The player once again takes over the control of Staff Sergeant Matthew Baker and his squads as they take part in "Operation Market Garden". With the goal to secure multiple bridges, three airborne divisions were dropped into the Netherlands behind enemy lines on the 17th September 1944 - one of which was the 101st Airborne Division, Matt Baker's unit. The game tells the story of him and his squad assaulting and securing Eindhoven and the subsequent defense of the surrounding area against the German counter-attacks.<br><br>As in the previous games the player, in 1st person perspective or via tactical map, orders his squad around the map from cover to cover, ordering them to suppress the enemy and planning a flank attack to take the enemy position out, always advancing to the next objective. But to spice things up a bit, there isn't just an assault team waiting to be controlled. In some missions the player gets access to more specialised machine gun or bazooka teams. Especially the latter is very useful now since cover can be destroyed with enough fire power. There are also missions in which the player has control over a tank or has to fulfill the objective completely on his own.<br><br>Like in Rainbow Six: Vegas the player can also now do a move called "Dig in" at each cover. This will switch the camera to a 3rd person view and make the character invulnerable to enemy attack (as long as the cover isn't destroyed). From this position he can blind fire or look over the cover to get the kill with the improved combat system which doesn't rely that much on flanking the enemy anymore since every part of an enemy can now be hit if it's visible. And if the player makes an especially impressive shot (long distance head shot for example), the game switches to a slow-motion action cam, showing the hit in every gory detail. Another change is the new health system. As opposed to a fixed amount of health, the characters now regenerate health automatically if not under fire.<br><br>The game also features a team-based multiplayer mode for up to 20 players in which the teams either have to capture flag points or defend these points or eliminate the whole opposition to win the round.

Description=Bubble Bobble Neo! is a modern version of the classic 1986 arcade game Bubble Bobble, similar to Bubble Bobble Plus. The core gameplay remains identical. The twin dragons Bub and Bob (now as 3D character models) need to clear more than 100 single screen 2D platform levels by defeating all enemies. This game introduces two additional dragons, a magenta and a purple one (Pub and Beb), for four-player cooperative or competitive local games. Those four-player games are played in the Arrange mode (co-op), which introduces sloped platforms, and the VS mode (competitive). The regular mode is called Classic.<br><br>Levels consists of screens filled with platforms. The dragon needs to trap enemies by blowing bubbles and then jump into them when they are caught to make them disappear. Defeated enemies leave behind vegetables, fruit, candy and cake that can be collected for additional points. Other useful items are special candy (extends the bubble travel, increases the speed or allows bubbles to be fired consecutively), shoes (increases movement speed), dynamite (kills all enemies with a large explosion), orange parasol (warps three stages), Chakkun's heart (temporary invincibility), and crosses (creates lightning, floods the stage or lets the dragon breathe fire). All collected items are stored in an Item & Food collection. There are over 150 different items to discover.<br><br>Bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms by jumping on top of them and keeping the jump button pressed. This is called a Bubble Jump. Additional techniques are the Spin Burst and Chain Burst. In the Spin Burst you have to let several bubbles float your way and block their path. Once they have clumped up, the dragon can turn around to burst it with his spikes to cause a chain reaction. In a Chain Burst a burst bubble causes any touching bubble to burst as well.<br><br>In the VS mode players can trap each other in their bubbles. As long as a player is trapped points are earned. To free themselves, the left stick needs to be moved quickly. Advanced players can also hunt Extend Bubbles in the Classic mode. These are bubbles that contain the letters of the word "extend". When the word is formed, an extra life is provided. In the Arrange mode this is expanded to four words: "hero", "extend", "never" and "winner", for one, two, three and four extra lives respectively.

Unlike MoH: AA these are not only presented from the view of an American soldier, there is a British and a Soviet campaign as well, each focusing on different parts of the battle. In total there are 24 interconnected missions to play to get to Berlin. In each campaign a different perspective is offered, starting as an American Paratrooper during D-Day, progressing to assume the role as an English Special Forces commando, and finally as a Russian tank commander. Some missions are played in solitary fashion, but in most of them the player is part of a larger group with computer-controlled team mates.<br><br>Most of the combat is infantry-based, but some is also set between vehicles or tanks. Multiplayer modes include death match, team death match, behind enemy lines (where the allies are outnumbered) and two objective-based modes: retrieval, and search and destroy.<br><br>The later-released console version Call of Duty Classic is a reworking of the original game with enhanced graphics.

You play as 4 allied sides with American, Canadian, British and Polish soldiers in 14 chronological singleplayer missions covering the 88 days leading up to the liberation of Paris. Surprisingly, you cannot play as the French 2nd Armored Division that actually liberated Paris.<br><br>The battles are usually dramatic with many fights and scripted events at the same time, consisting of infantry and vehicles, with semi-destructible environments. In between, there are cinematics that explain the events. A few gameplay mechanics have been kept intact or make a return: slight auto aim, the damage system that allows you to recover if you hide for a moment, and smoke grenades. New features include the ability to toss back unexploded grenades and actions requiring a successful series of button combinations. This can occur in hand-to-hand combat where you can yank the weapon out of enemy soldiers' hands. Enemies work in groups, try different tactics and search for cover.<br><br>The main multiplayer modes are standard deathmatch (battle), team deathmatch (team battle), Capture the Flag (either with two flags or two sides trying to control a single, neutral flag) and Headquarters (two sides either defend or attack a structure, and players can now respawn after dying). The new mode, War, is similar to the gameplay of the Battlefield series. Two teams start with two control points each, and one neutral flag in the middle. The objective is to control all five flags.<br><br>There are multiple-occupancy vehicles (Sherman Tank, Panzer IV, Jeep, Horch, BMW, Harley), and several multiplayer classes: Rifleman, Heavy Assault, Light Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each class has unique abilities. There are also two rankings: a normal rank system during a single game where your abilities improve if you do well, and an overall TrueSkill ranking. Also, unlike the previous games, your team stays grouped together after a match and is not booted back to the lobby right away.

The world is once again at the brink of destruction. The Russians, originally defeated by the Americans, make Zhakaev a hero and threaten once again the peace on earth.

Once enough experience points have been collected, the player advances in rank and unlocks new game-modes (ranging from deathmatch to pure team-oriented modes), new dog-tags and new weapons and abilities with which he can create his own custom class besides the five standard classes available. Also available is a coop-game-mode for two players called "Spec Ops" featuring several missions going on besides the main campaign in three different difficulty-settings with several different objectives including getting from A to B in a certain amount of time.

New this time around is the co-op campaign for up to four players, allowing everyone to play through the whole single player together with friends.<br><br>The first campaign begins on August 17, 1942 somewhere on the Makin-Atoll in the Asian-Pacific region where Pvt. Miller sits in a hut and has to watch how his squadmates are brutally murdered by Japanese soldiers. But as one soldier approaches him and prepares for the killing blow, an American bayonet comes out of his stomach. Now the roles are turned and in the following operations Pvt. Miller, under the supervision of Sgt.

Petrenko and begins on September 17, 1942 in Stalingrad. Lying in a pool of blood, watching how the Germans put one more bullet in his dying comrades, the private survives and under the helpful guidance of Sgt. Reznov begins his journey through the destroyed city to the main goal: killing General Heinrich Amsel.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode similar to the one from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare with the playtypes Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and Search & Destroy in which one team needs to plant a bomb at one of two objectives and the other needs to defend both. The ranking system also makes a return. For every kill or completed objective the player gains experience points and levels up to unlock additional weaponry, attachments or abilities granting a higher accuracy and such. These then can be used to create up to five custom classes in addition to the five pre-defined ones (Rifleman, Light Gunner, Heavy Gunner, Close Assault and Sniper).

Description=Billy Candle fled the town of Hope when he was young. Beaten by his dad on a daily basis, he looked for a way out and was drawn to the Call of Juarez - a myth about a great treasure buried near the city border of Juarez. His search yields no result and he returns, disappointed, to his birth village to visit his mother. One of the other villagers is Billy's uncle Ray McCall, once a fearsome gunslinger. Twenty years earlier, he decided to shed no more blood and take up the bible instead, becoming a reverend in Hope. When Billy secretly meets with his old friend Suzy, he is chased down the village and becomes an unlucky witness of the murder on his mother and father. He is spotted at the scene near their corpses while the farm is on fire and becomes the prime suspect. Reverend McCall swears vengeance and takes up his guns, disturbing the quiet village life. Fugitive Billy and hunter Ray become the two protagonists of Call of Juarez, a first-person Wild West shooter.<br><br>Players alternately take the role of the Billy or Ray. Their missions are set in the same locations, they sometimes briefly meet and their actions influence each other, but the paths are entirely different. Both characters can dual-wield revolvers or carry around a shotgun, a winchester or a rifle with scope, but Ray also holds a bible he can cite from to stun enemies, uses his fists, and he can kick and wear a protective vest. Billy on the other hand is younger and more athletic. He can climb rocks, shoots with a bow and uses a whip to scare off animals and swing from branches. Both characters have access to a time-limited concentration mode. Similar to the "bullet time" made famous by Max Payne, the game slows down and the cross-hairs of the weapons slowly move from the side of the screen to the middle. Players can use this technique to take out multiple enemies at once.<br><br>The playing style is also different. Ray usually moves around all guns blazing, while Billy is a fugitive, forcing him to sneak around and hide in shadows. Enemies respond to movement, sound and even flashes of lighting illuminating areas. The story takes the characters through villages, mines, but also train robberies, chase sequences on horses and one-on-one duels based on reflexes. Compared to its contemporaries, Call of Juarez is more similar to Dead Man's Hand with the linear mission structure, in contrast with GUN's large amount of freedom and the open environment.<br><br>Most objects can be picked up and moved around to the player's advantage - mainly as cover, but also for building structures, opening drawers, pushing carts and throwing oil lamps followed by a shot to set an area aflame. A compass with a red dot always points to the next checkpoint. Weapons need to be reloaded regularly, automatically or manually, and health is replenished through drinks. Players collect ammo from crates or dead enemies and can choose to exchange weapons.<br><br>The multiplayer mode features online play against up to 31 other people in different modes. From deathmatch and team deathmatch to modes like "gold-fever" in which players pick up as much gold as they can find on the map. The Xbox 360 version adds achievements, three bonus missions when you finish the game and ten duel challenges.

Description=What made Ray McCall put down his revolver and become a reverend in the town of Hope? A question Call of Juarez never answered. The successor, Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood tells the story of what happened 20 years ago that dramatically changed the life of a fearsome gunslinger. The story begins right during the War of Secession with Ray and his brother Thomas as soldiers in the confederation. But soon they realize that their family at the farm in Georgia is in danger and they leave the army as deserters only to arrive home too late. Only their youngest brother, William, survived the attack. While he tries to give his brothers strength through faith, Ray goes on a rampage for revenge - pulling Thomas right with him down a dark path that in the end can only lead to the inevitable.<br><br>At the beginning of a level, the player normally has the option to choose between playing either Ray or Thomas. Only in a few missions the game decides this. Choosing with which character to fight his way in first-person-shooter style through the levels greatly influences the gameplay. While Ray shoots first and asks questions later, he can neither climb over obstacles nor use bows or throwing knives for stealth kills. On the other hand Thomas could not even kick in a door if his life depended on it. So most of the time the two need to work together. Sometimes though the characters split up and the mission progresses differently for each one of them. In addition at certain points in the game the two use their coop concentration mode together, allowing them to simultaneously slow down time and use their two different special attacks to take down large groups of enemies. While Ray has to aim during concentration mode to unleash hell on his enemies afterwards, Thomas's cross-hair automatically jumps from enemy to enemy but requires the player to pull the trigger manually each time. Similar to the duels, in which the player needs to draw his gun in one move before he can fire, this is done by performing a virtual backwards pull with the mouse or the analog stick. To limit the access to concentration mode, its "power" needs to replenished by killing six enemies and only holds for a certain amount of time if not used before it vanishes.<br><br>Besides the story campaign, the game also features a class-based multiplayer mode for up to 12 players. While no coop-mode is available, the players can shoot each other in Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Wanted. In Wanted one player takes on the role of a wanted criminal and needs to be taken down. The player that manages to put him to rest then automatically becomes the criminal himself. Manhunt builds on that premise by putting a whole team on the hunt for the wanted criminal for 60 seconds which himself is defended by a complete team. The last mode, Historical Events, pits two teams against each other where one team needs to fulfill objectives during a time limit (like blowing up a weapons cache) with the other team tries to stop them.

Description=Carcassonne is a turn-based strategy game for 2 to 5 players based on the German board game of the same name. By playing land tiles one by one, players build up a landscape of cities, roads, farms, and monasteries. Players compete to claim control of the features they build with a limited supply of follower pieces. Judging where to play the tiles and when to use a follower or not is a deceptively simple process - yet the depth of the game stems from judging when and where to use the followers to gain the most points.<br><br>Since the land tiles are random for each game, it has infinite replayability. Knowing which tiles are still left in the "deck" is a bit like counting cards in blackjack - the skilled player will beat the luck of the draw every time. Therefore one-to-one games play quite differently than with 4 or 5 players.<br><br>The game is playable with 4 players on the same console on one TV in roughly 15 minutes and also with 5 players via Xbox Live. Next to the base game it also includes the "The River" expansion by default. It builds a river of 12 extra tiles before each game, dividing the land in halves.

Description=Castle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat-em-up involving knights who need to retrieve a stolen gem and many princesses for their king. Using a hand-drawn style as seen in Alien Hominid, players can initially choose from four different knights with separate fighting styles, along with the alien from Alien Hominid. Other characters (20 in total) are later unlocked or discovered through the course of the game. Although the game can be played by a single player, up to four player can fight together on the same screen in the cooperative game modes, both offline and online. Some elements in the levels can only be activated or interacted with by specific characters.<br><br>Starting with basic moves, defeating enemies fills up an experience meter (up to 99 levels) that provides skill points. These can be attributed to strength, magic, defence and agility and consequently unlock a large amount of new moves and combos. Basic movement includes jumping, a light and a strong attack, blocking and magic. While playing, there are 40 different weapons to collect (included ranged ones such as a bow), each with different attributes. Only one can be wielded at a time, but all discovered weapons are stored at a blacksmith. The different levels are shown on a map where the player can move around and revisit locations. Some are locked until the player is strong enough. There are also shopping areas where life potions can be stocked, along with new weapons. Characters can also move around on mounts such as lizards, when they are captured.<br><br>Another element is the animal orbs. They become available through the game and acts as companions that assist the player, through attacks, defence or special abilities such as digging up hidden items in the levels. As in all games by The Behemoth, there is a focus on wacky humour in the game design and animations. When playing together with other players, after defeating a boss the knights need to fight each other to win the princess' kiss.<br><br>Next to the main game there are also arena fights against increasingly difficult waves of enemies and the All You Can Quaff mini-game where players button-mash to eat as quickly as possible. Through the different playing styles of the characters, there is plenty of replayability.

Description=Castlevania: Harmony of Despair brings together a cast of protagonists from previous games in the series with the classic 2D platformer gameplay. The focus is on cooperative gameplay with up to six vampire hunters workings towards the same goal of eventually destroying the citadel Castlevania. This is similar to the Boss Rush mode from previous games, but there is also a Versus mode to play against each other, based on points. Additionally the game can be played alone, in a singleplayer story mode. It consists of six large maps that can be browsed while playing. There are three different zoom levels (not pausing the game) and even though the closest one is the only suited to play, the others allow you to view the entire level layout in a single screen to plan a path and find out where the treasure is. At the end of each level is a boss that needs to be defeated and familiar villains such as Gergoth, Dullahan, Puppet Master, Death, and Menace make a return. Bosses are sometimes able to attack players before reaching the end area. Multiple players start in different parts of the level and act independently, but since each character has a different set of skills, it is possible to help each other by dousing fire to clear a passage, or pulling a lever to raise a platform for another player.<br><br>Just like the previous games in the series there is a focus on RPG elements. For instance, using a weapon often raises the skill for it, making it more effective over time. The protagonists have health and magic bars, and when fighting enemies the damage dealt is shown as a floating number. Players can raid treasure chests and collect loot to equip both offensive and defensive gear, as well as gain bonuses for individual skills. Often equipping mid-game is only possible when a magic book called The Grimoire is located. The character's main statistics are divided into seven categories: ATK, DEF, STR, CON, INT, MND and LCK. There is however no experience points system, unlike some of the earlier games, and it entirely based on better items and weapons. Money gathered in a level is carried over, even when dying. When playing together items in individually looted chests are provided to all players. When one of them perishes, a grave appears where the character died and he can continue fighting in skeleton form, with limited abilities. Other players can use Water of Life to revive a character, but when all characters are in skeleton form, the game is over. Levels also need to be completed in less than 30 minutes. A number phrases is available to pass on a message to the players.<br><br>All characters share a number of abilities combined with a few unique hunter skills and a personal skill. They are able to double jump, use two types of attacks, back dash, and use spells. Other elements are only available to specific characters. Alucard can change forms while Shanoa uses glyphs near a magnet to attach to it, build up tension, and then spring away at rocket speed. Enemy abilities are sometimes released in spirit form and can be used by the player, based on three categories: Bullets (collect up to four bullet souls), Guardians (used as a personal skill), and Enchantment (activated immediately when it is equipped). Spells are collected though magic scrolls and there are four types of dark magic, while for Jonathan Morris martial arts scrolls provide new physical abilities. Magic is also acquired by Charlotte Aulin using the book of binding to lock projectiles and enemy spells, or by absorbing the magical sigils that appear sometimes when enemies use magic.<br><br>Initially five characters are available, with more to be made available through downloadable content. In multiplayer eight different palettes are provided to change the appearance of identical ones. The characters available by default are:<br><br>1. Alucard (from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night)<br>2. Charlotte Aulin (from Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin)<br>3. Shanoa (from Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia)<br>4. Soma Cruz (from Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow)<br>5. Jonathan Morris (from Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin)

Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters into Castlevania to find some answers and perhaps destroy the castle once again.<br><br>Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Dracula X: Rondo of Blood. The game is set in a castle which you can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of "special moves" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.<br><br>The Saturn release adds two new areas to the castle (the Underground Garden and the Haunted Path), a third playable character (Maria), and a few new remixed music tracks. However, it sacrifices a few of the graphical effects from the PlayStation version, particularly true transparencies.

The game borrows elements from Tetris and features procedurally introduced music by famous artists such as Philip Glass, Moby, Paul Hartnoll, Fred Deakin and Markus Schulz. All proceeds of the game go to charity projects such as "Save the Children" and "Starlight Children's Foundation".<br><br>In the game players place shapes similar to tetris blocks (but built from six squares) on a grid. The idea is to create so-called "quads". Quads are at least 3x3 squares. Once a quad is created the player has limited time to expand on the shape in all four directions by placing more shapes next to it.<br><br>The stage is also a time line. A position marker will slowly move from left to right. Each shape produces a sound once the position marker reaches it. The sounds are samples from the level's music theme and depending on the shape of the quad different samples are played. The further the player progresses in a level the more difficult it will become and the more hectic the music will automatically get as well.<br><br>Once a quad can no longer be expanded and it is reached by the position marker it is removed, but the grid it covered is colored. A counter keeps track of the percentage of the level that is colored, like in the arcade game Qix. The player needs to color at least 50% to unlock the next level.<br><br>The grid of each level has a different size and also different shapes that become available to the player. Like in Tetris the player can see which shape he or she is going to receive next.<br><br>The game features a free play and time play mode. In the time play mode players can choose between nine, six or three minutes. In this time they have to make as much points as possible.

Description=The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena includes two single player campaigns. One is a graphically enhanced version of The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and the other, called Assault on Dark Athena, continues the story almost directly after the end of Escape from Butcher Bay with Richard B. Riddick and Johns in hibernation on board of a ship deep in space. A group of renegade mercenaries finds them and brings them on board of their giant ship called the Dark Athena where they transform people into mindless drones. Of course Johns is a too valuable target to transform so they plan to collect the bounty that is on his head after he freed Riddick from the prison. Riddick on the other hand - well he managed to evade capture and is now really pissed.<br><br>As in the first campaign, the player once again assumes the role of Riddick, controlling him a standard first person shooter fashion through the corridors of the ship. But Riddick isn't one who runs guns blazing through the enemies. Instead the dark is his friend. Hiding in the shadows he uses his special ability to see in the dark, sneak up on enemies and perform an instant melee kill with whatever weapon he has currently equipped. This not only applies to his melee weapons that range from his fists to the newly double-carved blades but called "Ulaks" but also to the bigger stuff he'll find on his journey like assault rifles, a mini-gun and such. If he hasn't a gun available, he can pick up a dead drone and use hers. At one point in the single player campaign he'll even take over the control of a full-blown mech to reek havoc on the ship as he did back in Escape from Butcher Bay. If an enemy manages to actually hit the player, Riddick can use NanoMED health units to replenish his health. Since these only have a limited amount of charges he can refill them with NanoMED Catridges scattered around the levels. The bigger NanoMED health units permanently increase his health. And on his way through the Dark Athena he also finds bounty cards, the equivalent of the cigarette packs Riddick collects in Escape from Butcher Bay, unlocking extra content like artworks or personal profiles. <br><br>Completely new to the game is the multiplayer mode allowing up to 12 players compete against each other in several game modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Arena. Butcher Bay Riot and Pitch Black. While the first three are self-explanatory, Arena puts up to four players in small areas in either one-on-one or two-on-two fights while everyone else is spectating and waiting for their turn. Butch Bay Riot on the other hand puts three teams against each other with each team buying their weapons, ammo and armor before each round. With the goal to bring the power node located in the middle of the map to the enemy base, the guards, prisoners and mercenaries don't really fight each other at once. Instead each group has one specific enemy. So the prisoners go after the guards base while the guards attack the mercs. The last game mode, Pitch Black, puts everyone in a dark area with one player playing Riddick with his dual-blades and his night-vision ability and the others all playing mercs only equipped with their weapons and flashlights hunting him down.

Description=The Bible tells us that God created Adam as an image of himself - that is not true. It is also not true that Adam was the first thinking being to walk upon the earth. In the beginning was the Firstborn. The Firstborn was a true image of God. Perfect to the core, a creature with no sex, neither dark nor light and both beautiful and terrible to behold. God feared his creation and left it unfinished, banishing it to the Abyss and created Adam instead with all his flaws.<br><br>But the Firstborn had already touched the Earth. Leaving behind a taint so powerful that even God's expulsion couldn't keep it from breaking through into the mortal world to reclaim it's birthright. In a remote desert in the Middle East the Earth was wounded. Eon after eon the Firstborn continued to fester, breaking down the fabric of reality as human civilisation flourished around it.<br><br>According to an ancient prophecy the Firstborn will successfully break through into the mortal world seven times. Bringing with it diseases, corruption and perversity until seven mystics come and sacrifice themselves to drive it back into the abyss. This has already happened six times. Now once again the ground under the city called Al-Khali trembles as the Firstborn enters the world one last time to either be defeated in a last battle or find eternal freedom.<br><br>During the centuries every civilisation made sure that those seven mystics would stand ready to defeat the Firstborn and this hasn't changed. Known as the Jericho Squad they are now called to Al-Kahli. The city in which one travels further back in time as he ventures deeper into its heart until he reaches the beginning of all.<br><br>The game is a pretty straight-forward First Person Shooter but every one of the seven members of the Jericho Squad has different abilities and uses different weapons. While Cpt. Devin Ross uses the Patrioteer (a combination of shotgun and assault rifle) and is besides Father Paul Rawlings the only member of the team that can heal wounded teammates, Sgt. Wilhelmina "Billie" Chruch is more of a samurai. She uses a Nodachi as a melee-weapon and a rapid-fire sub-machine gun in addition to Blood magic which allows her to summon either a Blood or a Fire Ward.<br><br>Although your teammates do a pretty good job on their own, later on you have the ability to take over one of them and do whatever you want to do yourself. The squad is also divided into two teams which you can give the orders "Hold" or "Follow" which comes in handy if you position one team to cover your six and take the rest with you into the fight.<br><br>The health system is somewhat similar to games like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas or Call of Duty. This means that there are no health packs scattered around. When you're hit you have to search for cover to regenerate. If you are hurt badly enough you'll go to the ground but as mentioned Ross and Rawlings can bring you back to life. The game only ends if you can't be healed fast enough or both Ross and Rawlings are dead.<br><br>As the name suggests, Clive Barker, the maker of the Hellraiser movies, had great influence in the making of the whole game including art-direction and background story but Clive Barker's Jericho is not the successor to Clive Barker's Undying.

Description=Clover is a watercolour side-scrolling platform puzzle game. In design it resembles a traditional adventure game as most of the gameplay is centered around item-based puzzle solving and adapting to the world's events, without health bars, harmful enemies, weapons or dying permanently. In that ways it is reminiscent of the classic Dizzy series. The game is set in the peaceful land of Sanha ruled by King Heydrich. One day the Sanhan merchant ship HMS Jingo is attacked, sinking without survivors. The neighbouring nation of Andala is accused and the teenager Sam Kirkwell receives notice that he is now entitled to an orphan's allowance, as his mother was aboard the ship. Finding no way to cope with the loss Sam sets out to retrieve some of the ship's debris, as requested by the king.<br><br>Sam gets to explore much of the land of Sanha right away, talking to other civilians and solving problems. There are no dialogue trees and all interaction is done with a single key. Sam can pick up items to store them in his inventory. Initially only two items can be stored simultaneously, but later he will find a way to get a bigger bag. When a new item is picked up and no room is left, another is dropped right away, but it does not disappear and can be revisited at a later time. When solving a puzzle with the interaction key, the process is automated when Sam is carrying the right item. No inventory item combinations are needed and players also do not need to select the correct item from the inventory.<br><br>There are a few minor platform elements where Sam has to jump over gaps or avoid enemies. When dying or in a dangerous situation, the screen fades to white and a retry is offered. Sam can also regularly pick up newspaper scraps that are stored in his house and progressing through the game unlocks items in an art gallery. The game is complemented with full voice acting.<br><br>The reworked Windows version contains new animations for every character, new graphics, a revamped user interface and new effects. It also has complete voice-acted English dialogue for an extended script (four times as much as the original), and French and Spanish translations. The gameplay has been updated with new puzzles and subquests, four new endings and a playable epilogue. The controls have been tweaked to provide context-sensitive controls.

Description=The Club is an organization that recruits "outsiders" to fight in an underground bloodsport. Those "outsiders" come from every possible corner of the earth but have one thing in common: they are good at killing people.<br><br>Eight characters with different skills await the player. Renwick for example is an ex-cop which is rather balanced in the skills speed, strength and stamina. Once the decision has been made, the tournament needs to be chosen. Set for example in a Stahlwerk in Germany, each tournament consists of six rounds. Each round has a different objective. The sprint challenge for example requires the player to race to the exit before time runs out. The siege challenge instead requires the player to survive for a certain amount of time in a limited space.<br><br>But all challenges have one thing in common: The player looks at his character's back and shoots his way through hordes of enemies. For each kill, the player gets points and builds up a combo-multiplier. How many points the player gets depends on how high the multiplier is, where he hit the enemy and if he performed a special action before the kill like breaking through a door or jumping through a window. Each kill increases the multiplier by one but if the player waits too long between kills, it decreases. The higher it was at the last kill, the faster it will decrease.<br><br>The game also features 8 different multiplayer-modes. These include normal Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch as well as modes like Team Fox Hunt in which the teams need to kill the fox of the enemy team in order to win.

By 2047, Tiberium has spread and infested most of the Earth's surface, causing an ecological catastrophe. Red Zones are areas rendered inhabitable due to the severe Tiberium infestation and constant Ion storms, covering 20% of the planet's surface. Yellow Zones are areas infested by Tiberium but they hold most of the world's population. These areas are filled with civil unrest and are war-torn and ravaged but cover 50% of the planet's surface.

Description=In the alternative history of Commanders: Attack of the Genos, humanity has already in the early 1900's uncovered the secrets of the atom. The discovery of gene manipulation led to the creation of humans without faults that were stronger, faster and smarter. These new humans came to be called the Genos. Soon the normal humans decided to revolt, leading to genocide.  After a while a peace treaty is signed, but at the start of the game the human nations are strengthening their military. It's in this environment a young commander, Alec Falcon, is out training his troops, when he gets a distress call from a scientist. The Genos are attacking, and it's now up to the player to lead Alec and his troops into battle.<br><br>Commanders: Attack of the Genos is a turn based tactical strategy game. The player has a number of units that he has to command to achieve each level's objectives. Each under unit has a certain number of points that are used for issuing different actions such as moving attacking and capturing buildings. Each levels terrain affects the units' movement and defence.  For example, units have less defence when standing on an open road or path, but can move farther each turn. To cross water and ridges, air units must be used.  Units can be either light or heavy.  Light units are cheap and can move farther, while heavy units are slow and expensive but have more firepower. There's also artillery units that can attack over long distances.  Air units can move over great distances and can only be attacked by anti-air units. Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses and will therefore be more effective versus certain other units, while less versus others. <br><br>Each player has a commander unit. Each commander has a special power that affects nearby units.  There are passive powers such as extra defence, extra damage and healing that are ongoing.  There are also active powers that require that the Active Power bar is full.  They can be used to damage, heal or freeze nearby units for one turn.<br><br>Buildings can be captured by using infantry units. To produce units, the player has to build capitols, factories and airports. Throughout each level the player will find bonus tokens that can be picked up. These can have a positive effect such as extra health, money or experience, but they can also explode and thus cause damage.<br><br>After each completed level, the player will get a score from one to five stars.  This rating is based on the number of rounds it has taken to complete the level, the number of enemy units that has been destroyed, and how much damage the player has been taken in comparison to how much he has given.

Which means that the game is primarily a close-quarter fighting game but you will stumble upon long-range weapons such as pistols, shotguns, rifles and so on. As for the melee weapons, everything can be used as a weapon. You can rip loose wooden boards with the nails still attached and use as a weapon for example.<br><br>There are also new attacks in the game such as Environment Kill and Chain Attack. Environment Kill is pretty much what it seems like, after beating down an enemy to his knees you can choke grab him and use your environment as a final blow, like throwing him headfirst into a TV, while Chain Attack is like a combo system which is activated when a bar on the screen is filled. You fill this up by beating down a number of enemies.<br><br>Ethan Thomas is working under SCU (Serial Crime Unit) again so his Forensic Tools are back.

He is part of an investigation looking for a serial killer known as The Match Maker, who kills people and then arranges their corpse with a department store mannequin. During the search Thomas comes across another serial killer who seems to be very interested in Thomas and his cases. It is up to you to determine who the true serial killer is, and who is behind it.<br><br>The game is played from a first-person perspective with a variety of weapons to attack your enemies. Focusing on melee combat Thomas can grab items directly from the environment, such as signs, pipes, 2x4's, concrete, rails, planks of wood, even desktops and desk drawers. There is also a supply of firearms, such as the standard pistol and shotgun, but all of those only have a limited amount of ammo.<br><br>The hunt takes Thomas across several different areas, from an abandoned office building to a subway station to an elementary school to an apple farm on the outskirts of town, battling all kinds of deranged people along the way. Combat is brutal and Thomas is able to perform a number of graphic finishing moves. The game is largely set in dark and narrow environment, with many horror elements. Lighting is scarce and Thomas has to use his flashlight at all time to light the environment. Enemies are also able to pull fuses to turn off lights and use the new darkness to their advantage. Movement is generally slow, but Thomas is able to sprint for a short moment. Health is replenished through kits scattered around. Enemies engage using the same weapons and they are also able to grab Thomas, which requires moving around frantically until they let go, with a dark haze over the screen visualizing the effects of strangulation. The screen also often turns grainy when Thomas has strange visions related to the serial killers.<br><br>Next to the combat there are also many moments where Thomas has to investigate the scenes, using several different types of forensic tools to find clues and help further the story. Use the UV light to find traces of blood, get a blood sample using the sample guy, use your laser light to find evidence that may be hidden. You also have a scanner to scan certain items, and a digital camera for any photographs which need to be taken. Most of the importation is processed at the bureau and Thomas keeps in touch with them through his phone.

Pacific City is in ruins and it is overrun by mutant freaks. The player controls Agent, a member of the city-funded Agency that maintains order. The mutant freaks are backed by an anti-Agency group called the Cell and they turn into a heavily-armed terrorist group.

Underground, sunlight becomes the most important weapon. Once the absorption units guarded by the Cell have been recovered, sunlight can be collected to power beacons that deflect light into the lairs, tearing through the mutants that only survive in darkness.<br><br>Just like the first game exploration is furthered and encouraged by hunting down Agility Orbs that make Agent jump higher, run faster and glide through the air, making new areas accessible and causing more destruction with weapon and melee combat.

The player takes the roles of the main characters Semir Gerkhan and Ben Jger which are members of the freeway police. During the game they solve 32 missions, e.g. infiltrating an illegal racing club or rescuing hostages. Some of these missions are tied together but basically they are just episodes and tell no overall story. The cutscenes consist of camera shots around buildings and cars and voice acting from the original actors.<br><br>For the first time in the series it features a freely explorable town divided into two parts (city and freeway) but nonetheless the most time is spent doing one mission after another. The only thing accomplished by exploring the town are collectable car parts which improve the standard car. New missions are started when receiving radio calls by colleagues or sometimes by driving to a certain point on the map. During the game the player never leaves his car, typical goals are to stop another car (by thwarting it, shoving it a few times or crashing it), reaching a goal respectively driving through checkpoints in a limited time or beating regular races against time or other vehicles. Mostly he also has to limit the damage he does to his and other cars. Since the game is based on an action series there is usually no problem when crashing a few times, the player only has to watch that he doesn't lose his wheels because this influences the handling of the car.<br><br>Most missions are divided into secondary missions which are solved linearly. For example in one missions the player firstly has to reach a goal without causing too much damage, then tailing a truck, overtaking the truck, crashing an enemy and driving back to headquarters. The player can repeat a secondary mission as often as he wishes and also quit altogether. Later he can access this secondary mission (and already solved cases) through a case list in the main menu without having to start the free driving mode. <br><br>When starting a new mission the player can choose between three difficulty levels. Every time the players beats a mission he unlocks new starting positions on the map, new cars and new missions. Because some missions require a certain car to start suitable cars are marked with a flag besides them. There is also a mode where the player can race against other cars while choosing certain parameters, e.g. car, number of rounds or the course. These courses and cars also have to be unlocked by beating missions. The same goes for the multiplayer.

Description=Crash Time III is the seventh main game in the long-running German Alarm fr Cobra 11 series. It is based on the German action police series of the same name that first aired in 1996. In this driving game players control a car with detectives Semir Gerkan, one of the original characters, and Ben Jger who was first introduced in the TV series in the 24th season in September 2008.<br><br>The game is set in a large, living city that can be freely explored. The main career mode is centered around a terrorist attack on an international airport. Initially starting seven days before those events, Gerkan and Jger drive around performing patrol duties until they get involved with the gangsters behind the attacks. Most of the missions are centered around tasks such as tailing, stopping and shooting suspects, escort missions and reaching destinations in time (including getting breakfast). Most of the missions have a time limit that can be extended a few times, but at the loss of star ratings that open up new options in the game.<br><br>There is a wide selection of cars that can be unlocked gradually, with different categories such as American Cobra, Cobra Special, Transporter, Road Chief, Race Car and Police Car. There are about 40 vehicles and they are rated based on top speed, acceleration and handling. Cars take damage and the detectives also need to pay for damage inflicted to property or other vehicles. Using the siren or the horn, the traffic will adjust its behaviour. While driving, a large arrow shows the general direction of the objective and the remaining distance. There is also a top-down road map that can be consulted. There are different precincts and many distinctive areas and buildings such as the airport, the highway, hotels, churches, hospitals and a harbour. All cars have a nitro option for additional speed, with a recharge time.<br><br>Next to the main career mode, there is also an option to do races against other cars and a split-screen multiplayer mode on a single computer for up to four players.

Description=CrazyMouse is a game based on the mechanics of Pac-Man but with mice. The Story mode consists of 32 levels where the player controls a mouse that needs to gobble up as much food as possible. This is done by running around and collecting the pieces in a maze-like structure, shown from a top-down view. The mice can also sprint for a short while, but when they hit a ledge while doing that they fall off and loses all collected food. Most of the levels pit the player's mouse against other mice that have the same goal. There are a few variants where the mice are placed in separate rings with the ability to swap around, or levels where one mouse cannot pick up food but needs to hunt down the others. The levels are presented on boards, with different tiles, floating in the air. The Battle mode is identical, but with a time limit.<br><br>There are power-ups that introduce new possibilities:<br><br>1. Purification drink: removes curses that prevent the mouse from eating food<br>2. Power boots: a speed boost and assistance to go around corners<br>3. Mouse bomb: stun all mice within a blast radius<br>4. Ice trap: set a hidden trap that freezes opponents<br>5. Boomerang; throw a boomerang to stun an opponent and receive points<br>6.

Description=Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short. <br><br>In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.<br><br>Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).

This task is made more difficult by the aliens which constantly swarm out from the portals on both sides of the screen. These can be shot down by the ship's gun (which has unlimited ammo) or eliminated by activating one of the player's limited supply of "smart bombs", which will clear the screen of all current enemies.<br><br>The physics of the game were quite unusual for the time; the ship does not simply follow the mouse's movement like a mouse cursor. Rather, it retains its inertia, and must be carefully guided around so it does not crash into anything. Bullets, when fired, travel in the direction of the ship's movement, requiring the player to actually travel toward enemies in order to shoot them down.<br><br>This was the first color game for the Macintosh, although it was business-as-usual for the IIgs.

During their travels they integrate themselves into the setting not only with the correct clothing but also with the weapons fit for the time-period. Only if things get desperate modern guns like a multiple-rockets-launcher or an high-tech assault rifle enter the scene to make things easier. But not everyone can be killed on sight.<br><br>Important persons from history glow either golden or blue. While the first are mission-critical and have to be saved at all costs. The latter can be taken out by either shooting them in their limps or using the so-called chasers, small high-energy-balls that only react to blue-glowing enemies and will take them out without ruining the timeline. Although the mission won't end if the player kills one or more blue-glowing enemies, the reward at the end will decrease from three to no upgrade points at all.

Description=The Darkspawn Chronicles is a commercial downloadable content (DLC) pack for Dragon Age: Origins and is not integrated into the main storyline but has to be started separately. It is set in an alternate storyline in which the Grey Warden dies during the initiation and Alistair takes his place to defeat the blight. The player takes the role of a Darkspawn who has to conquer Denerim and protect the archdemon. <br><br>As Darkspawns are not exactly known for their friendly behaviour, the DLC consists entirely of fighting through the Denerim city areas. A new talent is used to force various Darkspawn types, e.g. Shrieks or Ogres, into the player controlled party - but since this is a frontal assault the player is mostly accompanied with a larger force which gets constantly refilled. In fact every dead Darkspawn in the party (besides the main character) is gone for good and has to be replaced with a new. This is not desirable because every Darkspawn in the party has an approval rating which brings certain bonuses; similar to to mechanics in the main game. The approval increases with every killed defender and by giving them war trophies which are collected from powerful enemies. These are main or secondary characters from the main game and their death results in a codex entry which shows the different development compared to the main storyline.

Description=It already started to be a bad day for William, owner of a struggling cargo delivery operations, as his old girlfriend shows up and announces himself to his next delivery. So it wasn't really getting worse when the plane crashed after they entered the Bermuda Triangle. But still the cause of the crash was a bit strange - Will could've sworn he had seen an UFO. Soon after he encounters the first robot aliens and unwillingly enters a fight not only for his own but the worlds survival.<br><br>The player takes on the role of William from a 3rd-person-view. On the ground, the game plays much like any other 3rd-person-shooter with William being able to carry two different guns at each time and having grenades at his disposal. Each enemy the player kills will drop tech points which can be used to upgrade each weapon three times to make it more powerful. But storming into a group of enemies won't help Will to survive long even with that kind of fire-power. Instead the game uses a cover-system that allows the player to blind-fire and regenerate his health automatically.<br><br>Not far into the game, the player will get access to a jet pack courtesy of Nikola Tesla who has the unknown island chosen as the perfect place to continue his research. The jet pack opens up a whole new dimension for the player, allowing him to both fly around and attack enemy targets from the air. In addition the jet pack also allows the game to play with the senses of the player. It just doesn't matter that much anymore if he is fighting his way up or down a cliff or which way he's flying through a tunnel. In addition advanced combat options are available while flying through the air allowing the player to make quick turns or skyjack an enemy UFOs after completing a quick-time-event.

Description=Darwinia+ is a tweaked Xbox Live Arcade release of both Darwinia and Multiwinia.  The game takes place entirely inside a computer simulation, and features retro-styled graphics reminiscent of the film Tron. Similar to Lemmings, the player must use different unit types and assignable skills to create the non-controllable stick-man population (Darwinians) and guide them to safety. Standing in the way are a series of natural barriers, hazards, and the minions of a computer virus rampaging through the server. Leave shards of the virus alive, and it will reinfect areas of the server you've already cleared.<br><br>The single-player campaign takes place across 10 levels, with an additional 49 maps for multiplayer.  Single player primarily involves puzzle-solving and completing specific objectives.  Multiplayer puts the players in command of opposing Darwinian armies in a versus mode, similar to a traditional RTS.  Armies spawn steadily from captured spawn points, and must complete goals like King of the Hill and Capture the Flag.  Unlike the single player game, the player can select groups of Darwinians and order them around.  They will attack nearby enemies or capture nearby points. Further control can be gained by promoting officers to organize troops into formations, or by capturing crates which bestow buffs or single-use attacks (like airstrikes).<br><br>Differences from the original Darwinia primarily deal with control schemes. In this version, the player directly controls combat units, and directs their fire with the right stick.  A cursor is controlled with the left stick and selections made with the right stick. A.I. completes default tasks for units left to their own devices. A tutorial has also been added, guiding players through the initial stages of the workings of Darwinia.

Description=Deadliest Warrior is a game based on the US Spike TV program of the same name. It poses the hypothetical question who was the deadliest warrior of all time in the history of mankind, spanning all of time and the entire globe. The concept has been translated as a 3D one-on-one fighting game. It is similar in design to the Street Fighter games for instance, except that the focus is on deadly efficiency. Rounds generally last only a few seconds, the number of moves is limited (without combos), and the characters can only take very little damage. Every hit also renders them less able to fight with broken limbs, to fatal wounds and even amputation. In that way it is more similar to games such as Bushido Blade.<br><br>Every character has a very different fighting style, from the swift ninja to a sturdy and well-armored knight. They only have realistic weapons and the fighting style also aims to be authentic, without special moves or unrealistic gameplay. Weapons are used for melee combat, but also from a distance including projectile-based attacks. Before starting the game players get to choose a character and select the weapons from a limited pool. Not everything is available right away, it needs to be unlocked in the single-player ladder mode. The characters can move freely in the open, 3D arenas and also sidestep.<br><br>Multiplayer is supported for online tournaments and in the singleplayer mode there is a number of challenges, and mini-games based on show fragments where pig carcasses need to be sliced with a set time limit for instance. A large part of the animation was created through motion capture with the original actors of the show.<br><br>There are eight warriors included:<br><br>1. Apache<br>2. Knight<br>3. Ninja<br>4.

The player controls Agent York as he investigates the mysterious circumstances in Greenvale. Greenvale itself is a large, open town that can be freely explored on foot or in a vehicle, with a slightly-accelerated day/night cycle dictating when shops are open, when people are available to talk to, and when missions to drive the story forward are available. York himself must eat and sleep (or at least drink coffee), as well as shave regularly and wash his clothes when they get dirty. There are shops and restaurants around Greenvale where items and weaponry can be purchased.<br><br>York has a variety of weapons at his disposal. His basic weapon is an FBI-issue pistol which has infinite ammo, but there are also a variety of other firearms available including machine guns and revolvers, each of which has its own strengths against different types of enemies. There are also a variety of blunt and bladed weapons, including knives, crowbars, and golf clubs.

Description=You play as Frank West, a freelance photo-journalist, and you're on a hunt for the scoop of a lifetime. Following a lead to the town of Willamette, he finds that the town has been practically taken over by zombies. Trying to get away, Frank makes his way to the Willamette shopping mall hoping he can find help there.<br><br>Gameplay takes place in a set seventy-two-hour period where one hour of real time equals twelve hours in game. Frank can freely move about the entire mall, though some areas are not accessible in the beginning. Most of it is infested with zombies, but he has a safe base in a security room. Players can follow the main plot, where they must be in the right place at the right time and successfully complete missions in order to advance, or do side missions, wander around killing zombies and dressing up in clothes from the mall stores, or just stay on the roof and wait for the helicopter to come back to pick him up. The helicopter comes at the end of the three days and the game is over regardless of whether Frank is on the roof to get rescued.<br><br>Frank gains experience by taking pictures, rescuing survivors and killing zombies. As he gains experience, he levels up, which gives him new moves, a larger inventory and more health.<br><br>Pictures are scored based on the number of survivors or zombies, their proximity to the camera and on emotional content, like horror, humor or sexiness.<br><br>Survivors are located throughout the mall and Frank must show up at the right time to rescue them. If you show up too early, they may not be at their location yet and if you show up too late, they will be dead. Frank can lead survivors back tot he safety of the security room so they can be rescued. To do this, he can equip them with weapons and order them to follow him or wait at a specific location.<br><br>Rescuing survivors is complicated by the huge crowds of zombies roaming around the mall. There can be up to one thousand on screen at a time. Frank must avoid getting bitten and make sure the survivor continue to survive as he leads them. In addition to the zombies, Frank must face off against psychopaths, who are human who snapped when they saw the zombies and have become crazed killers.<br><br>Almost anything in the mall can be picked up and used. Food items restore health. Also everything else can be used as a weapon. Obvious, it's far more effective to kill zombies with a sub-machine gun or a chainsaw than by throwing CDs at them or hitting them with a mannequin, but you do have options and you may have to resort to killing zombies with a bowling ball or with you bare hands because all weapons have limited ammunition or durability and will eventually run out. You can pick up books from bookstores. These give you bonuses, like increased durability for a class of weapons, while in your inventory. There are also several vehicles you can use.<br><br>In keeping with the real-time theme, you are only allowed one save slot. Frank can save in bathrooms and in the security room, but this will overwrite and previous saves. If you make a mistake, you have to either restart the game, though you keep your current levels, or live with it and move on. This means your decisions do have consequences.<br><br>Once you complete the main plotline, you go into overtime mode, where Frank, rather than getting on the helicopter, gets another twenty-four hours to resolve the plot. If you beat overtime mode, you get infinite mode, where the helicopter isn't coming back, Frank loses health over time and all the survivors are trying to kill him. The object here is to stay alive as long as possible.

Description=Dead Rising 2 starts several years after the original Dead Rising finished: the experimental virus that turns living beings into the undead has spread beyond Willamette and infested most of the United States. When the crisis became serious, a synthetic drug called "Zombrex" which delays the zombification was released by the pharmaceutical company Phenotrans and sold out quickly.<br><br>The player takes control over Chuck Greene, a former national motocross champion fleeing to Fortune City, rebuilt from the remains of old Las Vegas and yet untouched by the zombie disease, along with his daughter Katey. Katey was bitten by her zombified mother and thus needs a shot of Zombrex every 24 hours to avoid zombification. In order to get his hands on more Zombrex - or at least the money to buy some - Chuck is desperate enough to enter a game show called "Terror Is Reality" where he has to slay the undead for entertainment. Right after the show some of his "victims" break loose into the city, causing a wide-scale infection. Chuck learns from a news report that he is accused of causing the outbreak and that the military will come to capture him and to purge the city in three days.<br><br>Like the first Dead Rising, the bulk of the game takes place over 72 hours, but once the player has completed all of the 'cases' (small sections of story that comprise the games objectives), Overtime Mode will be unlocked and adds extra time and objectives. During the initial 72 hours,  Chuck must get Katey more Zombrex, find a way to escape Fortune City and clear his name of wrong doing whilst making sure him and Katey survive.<br><br>Gameplay takes place in a sandbox-like environment. The player can freely move around in zombie-infested Fortune City and choose how they want the game to progress by either taking on missions (plot-related and side missions, the latter mostly include saving survivors from zombies) or ignoring them. The player can ignore the main story altogether, letting all survivors die, and just fight the undead roaming the streets or go exploring. This will not result in a "game over" screen, but in a different ending. If the player fails to get Katey a shot of Zombrex every 24 hours, the game won't end either (unlike Dead Rising 2: Case 0). If the Story Mode is cleared with the true ending (which requires to complete all plot-related missions, the so-called "case files"), Overtime Mode will be unlocked, extending the main plot.<br><br>Zombrex can be found on various occasions around the city or bought off traders looking to make a fortune off the zombie outbreak. For rescuing survivors, defeating psychopaths (survivors hostile to Chuck) and chopping zombies, Chuck earns experience points (called "Prestige Points" like in the first game) used to level up and gaining more strength, a larger inventory or new abilities (like faster movement or additional combat techniques) in the process.<br><br>The first game was especially known for its extravagant ways of killing zombies. Most of the environment could be used to defend oneself, from regular pistols and shotguns to all kinds of gardening equipment, food (throwing soda cans on zombies) or plastic light sabers that glow in the dark from a kid's toy store - nothing seemed too funky for the developers at Capcom. The new developer of Dead Rising 2, Blue Castle Games, held onto that tradition and introduced a new combat element: the work bench. Chuck is now able to build his own custom weapons by using stuff he finds in places throughout the city. The player may just mess around to find out how to build a certain custom weapon or collect special blueprints to construct them, so-called combo cards. These can be unlocked by leveling up, doing side missions or progressing in the main plot. Custom weapons inflict much more damage then regular ones and Chuck gains more experience out of every killed enemy.<br><br>If Xbox 360 owners have a save file from Dead Rising 2: Case 0, they can import the level, abilities and unlocked combo cards into the Xbox 360 version of Dead Rising 2.

Description=DeathSpank is an action role-playing game by game designer Ron Gilbert. Described by Gilbert as 'Monkey Island meets Diablo', DeathSpank combines the humorous characters and setting of Gilbert's previous games with hack & slash, loot-heavy action gameplay.<br><br>Beyond the expected action RPG mechanics of slaying monsters and collecting weapons and armour, DeathSpank can also acquire Weapons of Justice. By striking enemies with combinations of different weapons, a "justice meter" fills. When filled, powerful attacks specific to each Weapon of Justice can be unleashed. A massive boot-hammer stuns all nearby enemies, the Cleaver of Cleaving strikes all enemies in radius, etc. Weapons and other items (healing and buff potions, food) can be mapped any controller face button or D-pad button.<br><br>DeathSpank features over 100 quests, a majority of which are optional sidequests. Conversations with NPCs use a dialog tree similar to many classic adventure games. Often conversations will allow the player to take wild tangents that are funny, but largely unrelated gameplay challenges. Some of the quests involve solving adventure game-esque puzzles, where non-combat items in the world can be found, combined and used in specific locations or with specific characters.<br><br>The story begins with the eponymous hero seeking for a powerful artifact known as "The Artifact." Coming very close to finally completing his quest, The Artifact is stolen away at the last minute by the minions of a wicked tyrant, Lord Von Prong. But it is soon revealed that a Von Prong actually desires DeathSpank's purple Thong Of Justice. He has kidnapped the local orphans and, as a Hero to the Downtrodden, DeathSpank must rescue them.<br><br>DeathSpank's art style uses a cylindrical "rolling world" with lots of pseudo-2D artwork to create the feel of a pop-up storybook. The world is populated with a number of horrible monsters, from the sneaky greems and chimeric bearalope, to the brutal orques (no relation to orcs) and the dreaded biclops. The game also features local co-op, where a second player can join at any time. They play as Sparkles the Wizard, a sidekick to DeathSpank with a fixed set of abilities.

Description=DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue is the sequel to DeathSpank. It was also created by Ron Gilbert and follows a similar action role-playing framework to that established by the first game.<br><br>The story continues right where DeathSpank concluded, DeathSpank having discovered his Thong of Justice is only one of six legendary Thongs of Virtue. The other Thongs, however, have corrupted their wearers (who include a nun, a popular TV chef and Santa Claus) and DeathSpank must defeat them to stop the evil of the corrupted Thongs once and for all.<br><br>While the first game was a parody of familiar fantasy tropes, the sequel visits and skewers more modern environments. From a war-torn WWII-esque countryside to the old west, the new environments also include a number of appropriate new weapons. Guns, grenades, bazookas, flamethrowers and even more bizarre weapons expand DeathSpank's arsenal for dispensing justice! There are also over 20 new and unique sets of armour, keeping DeathSpank safe in his quest to uplift the downtrodden.<br><br>The game features more side quests than DeathSpank, with more emphasis of puzzle solving (the Monkey Island half of the equation). Some familiar NPCs return, but many new characters join the DeathSpank cast, all fully voiced.<br><br>DeathSpank is also joined by a new co-op sidekick character, Steve. Steve is rumoured to be the long-lost son of Lord Von Prong, raised by marketing ninjas. He rides a pygmy unicorn, wields two swords and a fistful of shurikens, can lasso enemies and heal DeathSpank.. and sing, most operatically. Sparkles the Wizard, sidekick from the first game, is still available for co-op play as well.<br><br>At least twice the size of the first game, DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue concludes DeathSpank's Thong saga by providing more environments, more weapons and more quests, all in the name of Justice.

Description=As it's predecessor, the racing-game DiRT 2 doesn't just focus on accurately simulating the Rallye-sport like the earlier installments of the Colin McRae-Series did. Instead eight types of Offroad-events await the player during the main campaign called DiRT Tour:<br><br>1. Rallye - The player has to get as fast as possible to the finish line. He's the only one on the course at the same time and instead has to deal with hairpin curves and difficult terrain.<br>2. Trailblazer - Basically the same as Rallye but instead of narrow courses, this mode features long and open stages.<br>3. Raid - Races over wide and open terrain with many dangerous shortcuts allowing the player to get distance between him and the other drivers.<br>4. Landrush - All drivers start at the same time and the tracks are littered with crazy curves and jumps.<br>5. Rallyecross - Takes place on round-courses with a mix of dirt and asphalt streets.<br> <br>Gatecrasher - The player has a limited amount of time to get to the finish line. To replenish that time, so-called gates are scattered around the track each granting +2 seconds upon destruction.<br>6. Domination - Similar to Rallye, the tracks are divided into sectors. Each sector gives 1-10 points depending on how fast the player in relation to his opponents finishes it. In addition 1-10 points are added for his final position in the race once he crosses the finish line. The winner is the driver with the most points.<br>7. Last Man Standing - As the name implies, the goal here is to race around the course and be the last car in the race at the end with the last car being removed after each lap.<br><br>Each event requires either a different car or at least a so-called race-pack for that car both bought with the money earned by winning these events. Each car can be customized both visually and under the hood with parts unlocked by gaining a level. Experience points are awarded both for finishing races as well as completing missions like jumping over the finish line or getting through a race without any damage. The amount of cash earned at the end of each race, is influenced by the difficulty level. The higher the difficulty, the higher the reward. In addition the difficulty-level also changes the amount of flashbacks that are available for the race (from five to none). Flashbacks allow the player to rewind the action a few seconds when he made a mistakes or crashed and allows him to try that section again - hopefully without making the same mistake a second time.<br><br>The game features many real-world racers including their voices and their cars who give the player tips during the course of the DiRT-tour and also offer him additional challenges including duels and time trials. They'll also take part in team-events with the player, if he keeps them happy by not crashing into them that often during races.

Hitting the correct prompt results in bonus currency to use for upgrades.<br><br>Along with a 14-level story mode (told through short comic strips between levels), the game offers a Challenge mode (kill increasing waves of enemies while trying for combo points) and an Arcade mode (short rooms with different themes).  All of these modes have separate leaderboards, and optional co-op play.  <br><br>Drop-in/drop-out co-op is also supported for the Story mode, so friends can join a player's solo campaign at any time. The second player takes control of helpful entities earned by the first player, from a demon with a scythe, to a floating guitar.

Description=With Andy going to college, Woody, Buzz and the rest of the toys have ended up in a daycare called Sunnyside.  A teddy bear called Lotso runs the place, but it quickly becomes apparent that not everything's sunny in Sunnyside after all...  Disney/Pixar Toy Story 3 takes you through the toys' adventures that lead them to Sunnyside and beyond, as well as places not seen in the film, such as Bonnie's caffeine-fuelled imagination.<br><br>The game features two different modes - the first is Story Mode, which has the toys retelling the events of the movie to their new found friends.  In this mode, players take control of Woody, Jessie and Buzz, each with their own unique moves to help them explore the world.  Story Mode revisits Andy's imagination of Woody in the wild west, lets players play the Buzz Lightyear videogame seen at the start of Toy Story 2, has them breaking out of Sunnyside in a stealth level, and even takes them to a Haunted Bakery!  Each level has secret cards hidden throughout - these cards unlock special bonuses such as concept art, a short making of movie, and best of all, new toys for the Toy Box Mode.<br><br>Toy Box Mode is a deeper experience than Story Mode.  In this mode, players can explore all of the world of Woody's Roundup as either Woody, Buzz or Jessie (as well as Emperor Zurg in the PlayStation 3 version).  In this mode, players build a town for Mayor Hamm using the money they find by completing missions, which can be anything from rescuing cows, to destroying a dam, to taking photos of people or places, to racing in a giant stunt track, to catching bank robbers and throwing them in jail, to pretty much anything!<br><br>Money can be used to buy new toys, such as new town buildings, Micro Machines-style racers, Bullseye the horse (to ride), and even new citizens for your town.  You can also redecorate your town any way you like, using the items you find in toy capsules strewn all over the landscape.  These items can be used to change the look of your buildings, or the citizens themselves - you can change their hairstyle, clothes, or give them a new hat.  Some special missions are given using a ViewMaster-style toy where you look at pictures which give you clues on how to dress up toys or buildings (such as making four citizens look like a mariachi band and then placing them in front of the saloon).

Description=A moment of weakness doomed the Divine called Lucian. Instead of putting an end to all the misery by killing the child of the God of Lies, he showed mercy, let it live and even put it on himself to raise him. A most fatal decision, as it made it possible for the Black Ring to introduce Ygerna, daughter of Kalin, a necromancer in the ranks of the Black Ring, into the life of Damian as the boy was called. Bound to her through his love, Ygerna released the powerful magic slumbering inside of Damian. When Lucian learned of what Ygerna had done, he had no choice than to execute her. Being witness to the execution, Damian bound his soul to Ygerna and by doing so marked the return of the Damned. Damian swore revenge for the death of Ygerna but his rage and anger were also his doom. In the battle between the Black Ring and the Divine Paladins, Lucian managed to lure Damian into the Fissure-Temple and ban him to into the dark world of Nemesis.<br><br>But even the Nemesis couldn't contain Damian's rage and when he suddenly emerged from the dimension, the armies of Rivellon weren't able to withstand his force. The following war changed the land. Once mighty mountains were reduced to burned earth. Green meadows had to make room for impassable, cragged landscapes. Not all hope was lost though: when the Divine allied himself with the Dragon Knights, the last advocates of Dragon-Magic in the demon-tainted lands of Rivellon, the final battle against the Damian ensued. Ironic, that in the end all was lost because of the betrayal of one of the Dragon Knights who back-stabbed the Divine. But Damian got his revenge and both sides retreated from the battlefield. Since then half-a-century has passed and most of the people have already forgotten what had happened that day and already think of Damian as a urban legend. Another fatal mistake...<br><br>The player takes on the role of a Dragon Hunter from a 3rd-person-perspective but is soon involuntarily converted into a Dragon Knight giving him the ability to transform himself into a dragon once he uncovers the means to control his power. As a dragon he has access to different abilities, shares half of his experience with his human form and can of course fly over the lands and use his fire-spells to kill everything. In human form, the player has to decide after the tutorial if he wants to be a a knight, ranger or a sorcerer - although he is still free to level his five skills and dozens of talents as he pleases without being limited to fit the class he began the game with. The talents are divided into the five categories priest (can summon ghosts to aid him), sorcerer, knight, ranger and dragon hunter (general talents). One of these general talents is thought reading. For the price of some experience points, the player can try to read the minds of every NPC in the world giving the player access to new information, uncovering secrets and even unlocking alternate ways to finish some of the vast array of side-quests available in Rivellon.<br><br>As in most role-playing games points for skills and talents are gained at an level up and the experience points are gained through fulfilling quests and killing monsters in real-time combat which can be paused to issue commands like activating talents or drinking a potion. The means to do so, meaning weapons, armor and other useful items, are also obtained by killing monsters, completing quests, using the vendors or simply by opening/destroying all the barrels, crates and chests scattered around the world. At the completion of each quest, the player gets both gold and experience points and can choose one additional item as a reward from a list. This also includes additional experience points and gold.<br><br>Besides the dragon form, during the course of the game, the player also gets his very own Dragon Tower. Thanks to the Dragon Stone, the player can teleport himself to his home at any time. Part of the Dragon Tower is a chest in which the player can store important items, a waypoint shrine allowing him to teleport to any other shrine he already discovered, an illusionist allowing the player to change his appearance at any time and a bunch of collectors. These collectors can be send out into the world to collect resources (plants and such) for the player but are as vulnerable to attacks as every other NPC. To increase the chance of survival, the player can train his minions, increase their armor and heal them if they are wounded. Of course the player can also use the NPCs in his tower to do the same for himself. In addition there's an alchemist available who, provided the player brings him the needed recipe and resources, creates potions and a necromancer who can create a creature companion for the player. To do so he needs body parts (head, torso, arms and legs) that the player finds mostly in dungeons on dead NPCs or after killing a powerful monster.

In either case, they must go through a series of six 3/4 view maps which are city-themed with roads, building, lakes, etc. In each map, their character is upgraded with new abilities, such as faster speed or tighter turns. The player controls their character with the thumbstick and has a limited turbo dash. <br><br>In the driver game, players avoid the T-Rex while attempting to drive over delivery icons to deliver Doritos. Running into a building slows the player down, and getting eaten causes them to reset elsewhere on the map. In the Tyrannosaurus game, players attempt to catch and eat Doritos delivery trucks. In order to do this, they can stomp through the buildings, crunching them; though this also slows them down. <br><br>In some levels, the objective is to get a certain number of deliveries or eats before time runs out. In others, there will be a competing T-Rex or delivery truck and the player must rack up a target number of eats or deliveries before they do.<br><br>Additionally, there are two multiplayer modes. There is a tag-like Zen Mode where one player is a truck and the rest are T-Rexes. Eating the truck makes you the new truck. The goal is to reach a target number of deliveries first. The other is Chaos mode, where players are either a T-Rex or delivery truck for the whole match and the goal is to be the first to reach a target number of deliveries or eats.<br><br>Doritos: Dash of Destruction is free to download and play.

Now once again the fearsome Dark Spawn under the rule of the Arch Demon gather and are about to invade Ferelden. The first battleground: the destroyed city at Ostgar where humans and Grey Wardens meet the Dark Spawn to prevent death and destruction before it has even begun. Of course something went wrong and it is up to the player to unite the races of Ferelden and finish off the Arch Demon.<br><br>Dragon Age: Origins is a classic RPG played from the third-person perspective in real-time with the ability to pause the game at any time - at least on the PC. While the console releases are the same in story, multiple-choice-dialogues, items and overall gameplay, they differ from the PC-version in terms of controls and interface and are much more action-oriented. The PC-version on the other hand features extensive tactical options in combat. This includes an editor which allows the players to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Nonetheless the player can also control his party with up to four members one by one, switching between the characters, using their special talents and abilities to overcome the many different enemies.<br><br>During the course of the game, the player will have the opportunity to invite up to nine players to his party. While only four can leave the party camp at any given time, the experience points earned by killing enemies, fulfilling quests or simply opening a chest are granted to each member of the group - no matter where they are, making the player more flexible as every character stays in the same level-range.<br><br>At each level-up a character earns three attribute points and one talent point. The talent point is used to unlock new spells and abilities in the extensive talent tree differing greatly between the three available classes: warrior, rogue and mage. Every three levels the character also earns a skill point allowing him to learn or get better at herbalism or increasing his survival skills. In addition, at level 7 and 14 he earns a specialisation point which allows him to learn two of four class specialisations like shapeshifter and spirit healer for the mage class. These specialisations give instant bonuses to certain attributes and unlock five exclusive talents. But in order to learn such a specialisation, it needs to be unlocked first. This is either done by buying the corresponding book for a good amount of gold from traders or by learning it from another character, may it be an NPC or a party member.<br><br>Of course not everyone is willing from the start to teach the player. Especially the player's party members have to have a certain level of trust and satisfaction. Satisfaction can range from -100 to +100 and is influenced heavily by the decisions the player makes during the game. Talking and giving gifts to the party members also increases their satisfaction. A high level of satisfaction then grants the party member a bonus to specific attributes and unlocks additional quests as they open up and tell their past. In addition it is possible to have a romance with up to two of the party members if the player character is of the right gender and makes the right dialogue choices.<br><br>Although the main part of the game is the same for every character created and will only differ in what the player decides to do first or what choices he makes, the game features six unique origin stories - two for each race (except the humans who share the magi origin story with the elves). They all tell the story how the player's character met Duncan and ended up at the battle at Ostagar and also introduce at least one character that will become very important to the player during the course of the game.

Description=Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening is the first add-on to Dragon Age: Origins. After the death of the Archdemon in the main game, the Dark Spawn have been defeated and driven out of Ferelden. Well, it turns out the victory didn't last long. Those damn demons just relocated to the north and are now threatening the city of Amaranthine and its neighbouring lands. Worse yet, during the six months since their defeat the Dark Spawn got themselves a new leadership: the Mother and the Architect. And those two also bread a new kind of Dark Spawn that are actually able to talk. Luckily the player arrives in the nick of time at Vigil's Keep to defend the castle from the Dark Spawn, take over control of the keep and prepare to deal the final blow against the Dark Spawn. <br><br>At the beginning of the game, the player has the choice of importing any existing character from a savegame of his choosing. The character neither has to have completed the game nor to have survived the ending. The game will adjust the character at the start moving up to the minimum level of 18 or assume he didn't die at the end. Importing a character will slightly change some dialogues and appearances during the following hours but nothing plot-related or really important. New characters, on the other hand, will start at level 18 and be proclaimed to be Wardens from Orlais who have been sent to take control over the region.<br><br>Gameplay-wise, the game remains the same as the original. Using a party with up to three companions, the player talks to people in multiple-choice dialogues to get missions or advance the story, kills monsters in tactical real-time battles, fulfills quests in the five main new areas and earns experience points to level up and gain access to new skills and talents.<br><br>To accompany the higher levels the players are now able to reach, 32 talents and spells have been added as well as two new specialisations for each of the three classes including an extra specialisations point being available at level 22 allowing for three specialisations to be chosen. The three new skills include the ability to craft runes. This is especially important since the new armor runes as well as the new high-level runes can not be found or bought anymore. The only way to get them is to make them out of lesser runes.<br><br>During the course of the game the player can find up to six new companions, two of each class and one being the dwarf Oghren already known from the main game. As opposed to the original however, the dialogues with the companions are now triggered automatically at specific points in the game-world or at a certain stage in the storyline. Romance-options are also not available anymore. Also new with the add-on: two additional tiers for weapons and armor, additional types of usable items and several kinds of enemies including Darkspawn children.<br><br>The PS3 and Xbox360 releases of Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening do not require the main game to play.

Description=Conceptually similar to Pipe Mania, Droplitz is a puzzle game where the player has to guide drops of liquid (called droplitz) through a network of pipes. At the top of the screen there is droppers where droplitz appear from. The goal then is to guide these droplitz to the collectors at the bottom of the screen. This is done by rotating dials to create pathways for the droplitz. Each dial consists of a small pipe piece and these pipes needs to be connected to create the necessary flow. Droplitz are limited and will vaporize when meeting a dead end. When all droplitz are gone the game is over. Whenever a path has been made a purple bonus droplitz appears. When the bonus droplitz has reached the bottom the path is destroyed and adjacent dials will drop down and take its place.The difficulty also increases for every path that is destroyed. A new theme is unlocked for every five difficulty levels reached.  As the player completes levels, the speed of the game and the size of the board increases. In total there are nine boards (levels).<br><br>The game consists of four game modes: Classic, Zendurance Challenge, Power Up and Infection. The latter three are unlocked when reaching high scores in the mode above them, starting at 75,000 points for the Zendurance Challenge mode and then increasing for each mode.

In Power Ups player earns different power-ups, that can be used for destroying parts of the board, freezing the board or slowing down the speed of the drops. In Infection mode dials can get infected which makes them harder to rotate, which means they can only be destroyed if a path is made through them.

Description=Oblivion is the fourth title in Bethesda's popular Elder Scrolls series.<br><br>The continent of Tamriel is threatened by the Daedra Prince of Destruction, Mehrunes Dagon. The Emperor Uriel Septim and his three heirs were assassinated. You, a former prisoner in the Imperial Dungeons, were entrusted the Amulet of Kings by the emperor himself, and the primary quest is to find his illegitimate son, the last of the Septim bloodline. The world hangs in the balance, the Septims and the Amulet was the last barrier between Oblivion and Tamriel.<br><br>Oblivion sticks to the style of its predecessors featuring action-based combat, first person and third person views, and "free roam".  Your chosen race and class determine the abilities you have in the beginning. The game lets you play multiple types of characters but you are not limited to a specific role. By completing quests, your character can be a Mage, Fighter and Thief.<br><br>The advancement system, as was the case in previous games, is based on skill usage. When you use one of your skills, it improves. NPCs offer training (for a price) to help in advancing to the next stage. In time you can become an Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert and Master and gain certain bonuses for the skill. The skills of your foes are "levelled" to be approximately equal to or slightly above your own.<br><br>There are numerous side quests which help you advance your abilities as well as gain Fame. If you'd rather roam the world freely, there is plenty to do. Explore forts, caves, mines, and old temple ruins. Visit shrines scattered around Tamriel to get specialized skills, some permanent and some temporary.<br><br>Weapons and armor wear out with use and need to be repaired. At first you'll be paying NPCs for this task, but can do it yourself when your Armorer skill becomes high enough. Enhanced items (weapons, armor, clothing, rings, amulets) abound in the game for protection, resistance, reflection and special activities like walking on water, exploring underwater, becoming invisible or lightening your load. Enter the gates to the Oblivion realm to grab its sigil stone which can be used to make enhanced items. Higher levelled mages can create their own spells, and enchant weapons, armor and clothing using filled soul gems in addition to sigil stones.<br><br>Potions for healing yourself as well as poisoning your equipped weapon are handy and necessary. Buy them from NPCs in shops or make your own by gathering ingredients and the necessary apparatus.<br><br>The inventory system is divided into two main sections, Weapons and Magic, with subsections within each for armor, weapons, potions, miscellaneous and spells. When an item is picked up, it is automatically placed in is appropriate space. You cannot rearrange your items manually, but you can view them in alphabetical order, by weight, value or effectiveness.<br><br>In the Windows version, control is handled with both the mouse and keyboard. The mouse is used for direction and menu selections; the keyboard for movement and actions. You can assign up to eight items or spells for quick use while viewing your inventory and selecting it while pressing a numeric keyboard key. The game also features automatic saves, quick-save and quick-load.

In that realm exists an island that represents the madness of Sheogorath himself with its two sides Mania and Dementia.

But something is happening to the island and Sheogorath is looking for a champion to take care of it: you.<br><br>On the Shivering Isles you will find new many new dungeons, items, ingredients and spells which you can of course take back to Cyrodiil as well. Many new quests and questlines await the adventurer of which many rely on the different sides of the Shivering Isles. For instance, one quest requires you to kill an NPC but it is up to you if you kill the one on the Evil side or his exact counter-part on the Good side.

Description=After they had fought out their civil war on their homeworld called Stroggos, the Strogg ventured out into space to conquer other planets and study other races to integrate them into their own. In 2060 they enter space above their next target: Earth. The Global Defense Force (GDF) is completely overwhelmed by the attack of this highly advanced force but they don't give up and fight for their survival. Ultimately Earth will fall into the hands of the Strogg and the events which lead to the beginning of Quake II will unfold but until then, you'll be an important part of this last battle for control over the planet!<br><br>As a successor of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory focuses on objective driven gameplay rather than just capturing flags like you do in the Battlefield Series. This means that on every map one team needs to fulfill an objective while the other needs to guard it. For example on the map "Valley" the GDF needs to build a bridge, then drive a MCP over the bridge to a nearby outpost, hack a Strogg-shield so that the MCP can fire a missile into the Strogg base so that the GDF can enter it and destroy a generator.<br><br>To make it even more complex, most objectives need to be completed by a specific class. On each side are five classes and each class has special abilities. The engineer for example can build the bridge on Valley, repair damaged vehicles or deploy identities while the Field Ops supports his teammates by handing out weapons and deploying artillery systems. Since the maps are all pretty big, you also have access to several kinds of vehicles ranging from little quadbikes to helicopters.<br><br>Unlike most multiplayer-games, the teams in Enemy Territory: Quake Wars don't just have a different skin but are actually completely asymmetrical balanced from classes over weapons to vehicles. This means that while both teams have a medic, they both function differently. The GDF medic for example behaves like every other medic by instant reviving his teammates but the Strogg technician needs a few seconds before his dead companion is alive again. To balance this out, the Strogg technician can turn dead GDF soldiers into spawn hosts. So if he dies, he respawns at such a host (if it hasn't been destroyed).

Description=It's 150 years in the future and the human population is on the brink of extinction. A war between humans and mechs has changed the world for the worst. Buildings are completely covered by vegetation and left-over mechs still roam the cities. The few people that have managed to survive in the post-apocalyptic world are taken as slaves. Monkey, a gifted strong human, manages to escape a slave ship along with a woman named Trip. After the pod they escaped in crashes, Monkey awakens to find that Trip has placed a hacked slaver headband on him that will send shock-waves of pain to him if he disobeys her orders. Trip has enslaved Monkey for one simple purpose, she wants him to get her back home. If he does that, she will free him. Asked why he doesn't just kill her right then and there, Trip explains that if at any moment her heart stops, his will too. This sets them off on a journey back to Trip's village, one where the two must become one as a team in order to survive in a future left uncertain.<br><br>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a platforming action-adventure developed by Ninja Theory. In the game, the player controls Monkey in his escorting mission of Trip. Monkey is equipped with an extend-able staff which he uses in battle. As the name implies, Monkey has acrobatic skills like a monkey that he uses perfectly to climb on poles and escape from enemies. Combat is tied exclusively to Monkey's staff, delivering light or heavy blows and even shooting out plasma shots. While Trip does not help in the actual fighting, she can help in other ways like distracting the enemies or even unleashing a stunning EMP if she is attacked. Trip also uses a dragonfly camera that will scour the surrounding areas for mechs and mines. If any are found, they will show up on screen thanks to it being programmed into Monkey's headband. Tech-orbs found scattered throughout the levels are used for upgrading purposes. These include things like increasing Monkey health, adding more ammo for his staff shots, and even getting new moves. Platforming elements and level design are similar to those seen in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.<br><br>There are three difficulty settings that can be chosen. Playing on the hardest one will greatly increase enemy damage against you. The game contains a chapter select mode to replay any chapters that you have previously beaten. This allows you to do levels over again to get more orbs or even unlock certain trophies/achievements that can only be gotten in that certain chapter.

Laying beside the body of his dead father, the boy is attacked by a band...fortunately saved by the hero called Maze.<br><br>He is then taken to the Heroes Guild where he is raised. Time has passed and the child has grown, and is ready to take up his own quest to rid the land of monsters and discover whom was responsible for the deaths of his family and village.<br><br>Fable is a 3rd person RPG that casts the player as "the child" or "the hero" who must perform various deeds to graduate from the Heroes Guild and define themselves. Generating a new character, players will go through the Guild's training, and become an adult, thrown into the world to make one's own decisions.<br><br>The story progresses when the hero chooses "main quest items" from the Guild. Alternatively there are also other quests that the player may complete in order to obtain gold and fame. Some quests allow the hero to "boast" in front of his fans. Boasting before a quests adds added difficulty, such as "completing the quest naked," however will allow additional gold and fame to be obtained. <br><br>The game introduces a "good and evil system", similar to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Various situations, for example coming across a child being bullied, will force the player to make decisions which ultimately shape their character. <br><br>Making decisions deemed "good" and morale earns the player good points, while being selfish and "bad" earns evil points instead. These decisions not only alter character stats, but also the hero's appearance and even the environment around them.<br><br>"Evil" characters tend to look the part; growing horns, receiving scars and having a swarm of flies buzzing around him. A "good" character on the other hand might receive a halo and have butterflies swarming. However other actions such as receiving wounds in combat or casting large amounts of magic also affect the player's appearance. Actions also end up impacting the player's reputation, including actions that might be relatively unimportant in other games.  For instance, if a player kicks a lot of chickens, various people might start referring to them by the title of "Chicken Chaser" or using "good alignment" magic might cause people to start calling the hero "Runemaster" instead.<br><br>There are three main modes of combat in Fable: melee, ranged and magic. The Hero can equip any number of weapons, from swords to axes, and a variety of spells to either harm or help. What the hero wears also determines how people interact with them. Bright, saintly armor tends to make townspeople more willing to talk, while carrying a large axe and blood-red, darkened armor, might cause them to be more apprehensive.<br><br>An experience upgrade system allows players to specialize in one area, or spread throughout, to give the hero a more all-around set of abilities. There are three areas in which experience is gained: Physical, Skill and Will. <br><br>Physical experience is earned primarily by using melee weapons and can be used to upgrade the hero's strength or health. Skill experience is primarily gained through archery or trading and boosts archery prowess, speed or guile. Will experience is gained through magic usage and is spent on new spells or upgrading old ones.

In order to build the strength to overthrow Logan, the player must actually "play politics" with the citizens of Albion--which may involve making promises--and keeping them once the player has taken over the kingdom.<br><br>Fable III also contains an online and multiplayer mode, though somewhat more fleshed out than in Fable II.  Rather than simply being a sort of henchman for other players online, player's Hero characters can interact and quest with one another on a more equal status.  Another notable feature is the more action-adventure style of the game greatly limiting the overall numbers of menus found in the game for a more streamlined experience.

Facebreaker is an arcade-style boxing game where you and your opponent duke it out in a set of three rounds until one of you is knocked out.  If a winner is not decided after three rounds, the game goes into 'Sudden Death' mode, and the first person to KO wins.  The game also has a difficult to perform 'Facebreaker' move - if you perform this move on your opponent, you instantly win the match.<br><br>You can throw low punches and high punches, grab your opponent, or perform a strong attack.  By repeatedly attacking with low or high punches, you'll build up your 'Breaker Meter'.  If you hit with a strong attack when the Breaker Meter is filled, you'll perform a Hay, Bone, Ground, Sky or Facebreaker - depending on how full it is.  You can also use the shoulder button to block.  If you block and use your low or high punch before your opponent hits you, you'll perform a Parry, which counters their oncoming attack.<br><br>The game also allows you to custom-create your own boxers.  You can do this either just by using the game's editor on its own, or, if you have a camera, you can take a photo and the editor can use that as a starting point for your fighter.  You can even upload and download other custom-created boxers to see other people's creations!

Description=It seemed like a perfect world. After World War II the USA made rapid advances and technologies. Robots, Hovercars, just everything you can dream of was there. But eventually war raged again and in the year 2077, the dream suddenly came to a halt and mushroom clouds dominated the sky. The lucky people were safely secured in their bunkers called "Vaults". The others, well many didn't survive, others mutated heavily and overall what was left of the world was nothing more than a nuclear wasteland filled with ruins and signs of a once great civilization. Now it's the year 2277 and slowly but surely human kind leaves the vaults and reclaims the lands of Earth.<br><br>The player is one of them. As a member of Vault 101 in the wasteland surrounding the city formerly known as Washington D.C. and now called "Capital Wasteland". And raised in the vault under the tight rule of The Overseer and the watchful eye of his father he doesn't know anything about what's outside. But on his 19th birthday, his father leaves the vault and the player's goal is to go after him. Learning the truth about what The Overseer concealed all these years on the way.<br><br>But before the player can leave the vault, he has to create his character during several phases of his life from birth till his 19th birthday. He decides his name, sex and look on his birthday, decides the allocation of his skill points at the age of 1, gets his first weapon at the age of 10 and takes the famous G.O.A.T.-test at the age of 16. He also gets his very own Pip-Boy 3000. This wrist device contains the inventory, detailed information about his current condition, the quest log and everything else an adventurer needs in the harsh environment of this post-apocalyptic land.<br><br>During the game the player earns experience points by killing enemies, completing quests, successfully picking locks, hacking computers or simply by successfully using his speech skill in the many multiple-choice dialogues with the different NPCs with the goal to level up and earn more skill points. In addition, at each even numbered level until level 20 he also gets a S.P.E.C.I.A.L.-point. These allow the player to take special talents like "Quick Learner" which increases the amount of experience points gained for each action.<br><br>Of course, the many quests often can't be solved without a little fighting in-between and the post-apocalyptic wasteland isn't a very safe place. So the player not only can buy or find several different kinds of weapons (ranging from a baseball bat to a very powerful mini-nuke-launcher) and armors but also has the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.) available. While the player can fight his way in a shooter-like, but stats-dependent fashion through the world, thanks to the V.A.T.S. he can also pause the game and target specific regions of one or more enemies until the available action points are used. After all the actions have been assigned, the game plays them out in a slow motion and very gory cutscene.<br><br>Another important part of the game is the karma-system which is controlled by the actions the player takes. Stealing something lowers his karma, for example.

Description=Fallout: New Vegas, like its predecessors, takes place in an alternate timeline where a war over resources sprouts up in the 1950s and ultimately culminates in a nuclear apocalypse.  New Vegas takes place in the wastes of Nevada, surrounding the eponymous "New Vegas," a paradise seemingly untouched by nuclear devastation that takes its name from our own Las Vegas.  A war is brewing in this territory between the NCR and various "tribes" of raiders, including the Great Khans and Caesar's Legionnaire. The NCR, or New California Republic is a group that wishes to preserve ancient weaponry as well as bring law and order to the wastes.  <br><br>The player takes on the role of a Courier who is assigned to deliver a package to the mysterious and enigmatic Mr. House, the owner of New Vegas.  However once the package finds its way to its destination, a man in a checkered shirt and a pair of thugs intercept you and begin to dig an open grave.  You are shot, buried, and left for dead but are dug up and brought to a doctor in a nearby town by a robot who saw the events transpire.  The player must now find out who tried to kill him/her and why.<br><br>Gameplay primarily resembles its immediate predecessor, Fallout 3 in that it takes place from a first person perspective and has a focus on exploration and immersion.  Although each game begins essentially the same, once the character has molded their characters base stats, traits, sex, and appearance the game progresses in a largely non-linear fashion.  They can pursue the main quest or they can explore the wastes and take up side-quests from various NPCs.  The player will level up as they gain experience through completing quests, doing unique actions, and defeating foes.  <br><br>There are new gameplay elements; there is a larger variety of weaponry and the player can now aim down the sights with guns as well as change the type of ammo their gun uses.  Different types of ammo have different effects on enemies.  The player can also use workbenches, campfires, and reload benches to craft unique items, consumables, and ammunition respectively.  The player also now has an influence in different towns and factions.  Their influence will determine whether or not that faction or town is friendly to them or not, and the players affiliation to some groups may affect this as well.  For example; early on in the game the player will run into a group known as the Powder Gangers.  A nearby town is hiding a man whom the Powder Gangers are hunting.  If the player decides to befriend the Powder Gangers, he/she can reveal the location of the stowaway; however, this will tarnish the players reputation with the town and its residents will become hostile.  Players can also try and fool enemy factions by dressing up as a member of that faction, but must use stealth to avoid guards as guards may see past the disguise.<br><br>There is also a new mode of play known as "Hardcore" mode.  Hardcore mode is an extreme difficulty setting that alters the gameplay to make a much larger focus on survival.  The changes in hardcore mode are as follows:<br><br>1. Stimpaks will not heal your player immediately and will heal over a period of time, and they cannot heal crippled limbs.  Only a doctor bag can heal a crippled limb.<br>2. Similarly, the RadAway chem does not remove radiation sickness immediately but rather over a period of time.<br>3. Players must eat food, drink water, and sleep on a regular basis or they will die.<br>4. Ammo now adds weight and encumbers the player.<br>5. Companions can now be killed in battle<br><br>Besides these additions, the gameplay is largely intact from Fallout 3 and offers little deviation from its style.  As in Fallout 3, players level up, gain perks (although perks now come every other level and instead of starting with a perk, you start with two special traits.)  and can use functions such as fast traveling, waiting/sleeping to adjust the time of day, and fight foes using a traditional first person control scheme (although the 3rd person camera is still an option) or the V.A.T.S. targeting system which allows players to pause the game and target specific parts of the enemies body.

If the weapon is too badly damaged, it will be destroyed. The player can only carry one of each of the four weapons categories. Vehicles take damage and stop working after a while but can be repaired anytime by the player. If there is no vehicle available to get across the land, the player can also just go to one of the many bus stops in the world to get through the country without being attacked.<br><br>The player is not alone on his shooting spree through the country. Other mercenaries roam the bars and lands and if the player does something for them, they will help him in his missions. Either by giving him tips for the current mission, coming with him and fight side-by-side or by expanding the scope of the current mission to increase the award at the end. These buddies always wait in one of the many safe-houses which can be unlocked by clearing them from enemies. They are also used for ammo storage, saving the game and to fast-forward time to a certain time of day.<br><br>Besides the single player campaign, the game also features a multiplayer-mode for up to 16 players in Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond (a Capture the Flag-variant) and Insurgence. In Insurgence two teams fight over capture points on the map. Once a team has control over all points, the enemy captain can be killed in order to win the round. Each of the game modes also uses a class-based system with six classes like sharp-shooter or rebel (uses weapons like the flamethrower) and different weapon load-outs for each class.<br><br>The different versions are identical, including the editor, except for the save system. In the Windows version the game can be saved at any point, while the console versions prompt to save at checkpoints.

Description=Featuring a brand new engine (replacing the one used in five titles since FIFA 2003), FIFA 06 features new controls and gameplay, the most visible being more animations and better detailed ball and player physics and animation, the removal of the unpopular Off the Ball controls implemented in their 2004 version and remaking the free-kick interface so it's no longer obvious if the player decided for a shot on goal or a pass to a forward. Also new is the concept of "Team Chemistry"  which affects how well a team plays collectively. <br><br>Featuring 26 leagues from 19 countries, 29 real stadiums and over 10'000 players with data for the 2005-06 seasons, as well as international teams, the game kept the "Create a player" feature as well as the many managing options untouched from previous versions. Career mode, the 15-year long climb to the top of the game, features new options such as sponsorships (which will only accept good results), player contracts and more weight on the player morale: a demoralized player (usually from not playing or possible influence from random events) is more likely to under-perform as well as pressuring the "Team Chemistry" values downwards and might refuse attempts to renew his contract, leaving on a free transfer.<br><br>While there are still many unlockables in the game (mostly third kits), the way to earn points changed. Instead of gaining points from completing tasks (from entering the EA Trax or creating a player to winning the Champions League or completing a career), the player has over 100 scenarios to way in five difficulty levels.

Players can choose between 2 and 10 minutes halves in three different game speeds and four different difficulty levels. Over 510 teams are accurately represented in the game. 27 leagues from 20 nations are included, along a "Rest of the World" for the best teams in championships left outside the game and international teams. Spain, England (with two), France, Germany and Italy also feature second divisions. Players can also create two clubs, customizing their badge, kits and home stadium, selecting players from anywhere in the game, along the starting budget in manager mode. The player creation tool remains mostly unchanged, with the ability to customize everything, from faces  (with a complete set of options, from jaw width to eyebrow shape) to the appearance and playing abilities.<br><br>While the focus of this yearly update was on the game engine, the Manager mode was also enhanced: players now also improve their playing ability from being active members of the squad, forcing the player to choose between keeping his celebrated stars near retirement in the starting eleven, or give the benefits of the youth system a chance to shine. Another new feature, in what is now the primary mode of the series, is the ability to watch the game in a simplified text mode, with the ability to jump into action to turn the events still available. The points system was replaced by a less abstract currency model (with the ability to choose between Pounds, Euros or Dollars). Other game modes include Tournaments (including the creation of custom tournaments) and Challenges. By completing challenges (similar to the Global Challenges mode in World Cup 2006) the player can spend points in the Fanshop with items such as new teams, a special overhead camera, new balls from Adidas (including all original World Cup balls from 1974 to 2002), stadiums, third kits and special celebrations for created players.<br><br>Finally, online gaming received a new mode: Interactive Leagues. These are online-only leagues based on the fixtures of their real counterparts (English Premier League, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga and Mexican 1st division). Then, online players go head -to-head with their favorite teams with a victory counting one vote for their favorite team. Once the week is over, the team with more votes is declared the winner of the week, getting three points. The number of weekly matches a player can do in this mode is unlimited.

Next to the known modes, "Be A Pro" is introduced where players take control of a single, fixed player on the field. It is not a career mode, but mainly an alternative way to play the games. Online multiplayer options allow players to form a team of independently controlled players, with 10 human-controlled players at the same time in a single match. The camera is changed for this mode, to constantly keep the specific player, but also the action in focus.<br><br>FIFA Soccer 08 contains licensed music tracks from all around the world. Brazilian player Ronaldinho is the poster boy for this version, only replaced with prominent national players for specific localized versions, especially for the European countries.<br><br>The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions include online interactive leagues, with full national leagues against other players on EA servers. The game also comes with the tools to set up independent multiplayer games and organize tournaments.<br><br>The Wii version comes with the Footii Party mode, hosted by a Mii avatar of superstar Ronaldinho.

Description=Fight Night Round 4 is (as the name would suggest) Electronic Arts' 4th entry into the boxing series. This time around, you have over 40 athletes to choose from from a variety of eras and weight classes, including Evander Holyfield, Floyd Mayweather, and (most notably) Mike Tyson and Mohammad Ali. <br><br>In addition to the default selection of fighters, you can make your own customized fighter using a powerful set of creation tools. The most impressive among these tools is the ability to use a PS3 camera or EA Sports' own website to upload pictures of yourself (or anyone, really) which will then be used to create a customized 3D head for your created boxer. <br><br>These custom-built fighters can then be taken into the game's "Legacy Mode", which starts you out as a 19-year old amateur looking to make a name for himself in the boxing world. You will partake in numerous fights spanning your entire career, improving through the use of mini games between matches. You can win several different championships, and then try to defend your title(s) against other emerging boxers. Once your fighter retires, he can then be selected in the exhibition mode to fight any of the default boxers in the game. How effective your fighter once he's added to the selectable roster is entirely based on how many special challenges you complete during his career -- things such as maintaining a 95% win percentage or holding three titles at the same time.<br><br>Fight Night Round 4 also features an online world championship, which will rank you against every other player in the world in the same weight class as your fighter. Wins and losses are kept track of in this mode.

Description=The city of Cocoon is a flying utopia, floating high above the skies on the planet Pulse. Created by a supernatural being known as the fal'Cie, it is a safe haven for the humans who live there and is protected by giant commissioned machines. Communication between Cocoon's citizens and the outside world has been barred by Cocoon's holy government, the Sanctum. The Sanctum use their own specialized army known as PSICOM to "Purge" any citizen who makes contact with outsiders from Pulse, and banishes them from Cocoon.<br><br>When a former Cocoon soldier known as Lightning infiltrates Pulse with intent to destroy a fal'Cie who resides there, she along with two exiles, Vanille and Hope, are unwillingly marked as fal'Cie slaves known as l'Cie and are forced to do the fal'Cie bidding. Given the power of the crystals the newly formed l'Cie risk becoming crystallized creatures if they fail to complete their mission or "Focus". In a sudden turn of events, the fal'Cie living on Pulse give Lightning and the other I'Cie one simple task; to take down PSICOM and bring about the end of Cocoon.<br><br>Final Fantasy XIII is the first Final Fantasy to go High Definition on the next-gen consoles. It, along with Final Fantasy Agito XIII and Final Fantasy Versus XIII make up a collection of games under the Final Fantasy XIII label known as Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy XIII.<br><br>The main characters you will be able to control in the game are Lightning, Snow, Vanille, Sazh, Hope, and Fang. They are all made into l'Cie at some point and can use magic. Summons which are popular in the FF series return with the name Eidolons, and each I'Cie has one.<br><br>The Active Time Battle system from the previous games will return, with some improvements. Commands and attacks can now be stacked into battle slots, which allows for use of multiple commands in one turn for a devastating combo. These commands are filled based on the ATB cost which eliminate the need for MP. Also your entire party's health is restored before every fight since magic cannot be used outside of battle. Another new feature allows you to basically rewind a battle and let you play it again if you didn't like the outcome of the match.

Description=Final Fight: Double Impact is a combined release of the arcade versions of Final Fight and Magic Sword. Both games have been optimized for HD, and allow for drop-in drop-out co-op for two players local or online.<br><br>In Final Fight, players must rescue Mayor Haggar's daughter from the street gang holding her for ransom. Playing as either Guy (a martial artist), Cody (a street brawler), or Haggar (a professional wrestler), the player(s) must beat waves of thugs and end-of-level bosses to find Jessica. Players can find and pick up temporary weapons like knives and steel pipes to use, as well as food items to repair their health. There are seven levels in all, and between some levels are minigames such as destroying a parked car or smashing panes of glass in a factory.<br><br>In Magic Sword, players climb a tower packed with monsters, with each level acting as a floor of the tower. The player uses swords and magic to defeat their foes, both of which can be upgraded with items found in treasure chests or after defeating bosses. During their climb, players can use keys to rescue A.I. controlled prisoners, who will fight alongside the players for a short time.<br><br>Both games are presented with optional filters to sharpen the visuals for HD, replicate the curve and phosphor glow of an arcade screen, or play with original unfiltered graphics.  Both games play inside a virtual replication of their original cabinets, or as free-floating screens with stretch and zoom controls. Players can also select from original or newly-remixed music tracks.<br><br>Both titles pull their gameplay from their original ROMs, with no censorship performed (Final Fight retains the underboobs for Roxy, the original names for Sodom and Damnd, and the "Oh my God!" cry from the victim of the destroyed car). Players can also tackle in-game challenges (such as beating a level in a specific time or number of continues) to unlock retrospective materials from a "Vault" for each game, including concept drawings, fan art, and the entire "Final Fight" episode of the Street Fighter 1997 cartoon.

Description=In the near future, the world has been ravaged by nuclear war. Cities have turned to rubble, and only disparate pockets of humanity yet remain. Ruthless gangs clash for control of precious food and water, and prey on the weak to show their strength. One man walks the wastelands, righting wrongs, destroying evil, fighting for justice and lost love. His name is Kenshiro, successor to the ancient art if Hokuto Shinken -- the Divine Fist of the North Star.<br><br>Fist of the North Star is an action game based on the iconic manga from 1983 by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara, and is part of Koei's long-running Warriors franchise. The player controls either Ken or one of his many allies and enemies in one of several game modes.<br><br>The main attraction is Legend Mode, which follows the story of the original manga. Unlike most Dynasty Warriors spinoffs, this mode pits the player as a lone warrior -- sometimes with one or two allies, but often alone -- against waves of thugs, fighting through wastelands and destroyed cities to reach the boss at the end. There are seven missions in each chapter, which include varied objectives like defeating a group of enemies within a time limit, reaching an area before enemies arrive, or protecting a group of defenseless villagers. Each chapter culminates with a boss fight at the end, who must be dispatched by using one of the character's signature moves.<br><br>Additionally, there is also Dream Mode, which presents a series of "what if?" stories for each character. Dream Mode missions take a more traditional Dynasty Warriors-style approach, featuring large, open maps filled with enemy and allied armies, bases to capture, and changing conditions as the battle progresses. Dream Mode can, unlike Legend Mode, be played two-player cooperatively. Any unlocked mission can be played with any character, though only completing a mission with the designated character will unlock the next mission. Completing Legend and Dream mode stories will unlock new characters to play as.<br><br>As the player defeats enemies and completes missions, karma points are earned. If enough karma points are earned, they turn into skill points which can be used to purchase upgrades for that character. The upgrade system uses the "meridian chart", where numerous spheres are aligned in a grid. Starting from the center, the player can only purchase upgrades that are connected to any other upgrade that has already been purchased. Upgrades include simple enhancements to strength and health, slotted skills and attributes such as attack attributes and faster karma gain, and even additional Signature Moves -- up to eight for each character.

Description=Flotilla is a strategy game mixing combat and exploration in space. The premise is simple: the player has only seven months left to live and with nothing to lose he begins his last adventure. This adventure allows the player to explore the galaxy and build and customize his own space ship fleet. The game universe is randomized for every playthrough. The universe consists of numerous planets and the player moves between them one at a time. Each planet consists of an event which can be anything from helping cats running from the authorities to baby yetis chewing on the ship's electrical conduits. Often the player needs to make a choice (like helping a character or not) and these choices will then influence upcoming events. <br><br>At the start of the adventure the player has two small ships but as progress is made the fleet might grow and it is also possible for the player to customize his fleet. The player can get ship upgrades either from an event or from being victorious in battle. <br><br>Some events lead to combat with other fleets of the galaxy. The battles of Flotilla are simultaneous turn-based, meaning that the player moves at the same time as his enemy. The combat consists of two phases: the orders phase and the action phase. In the order phase the player gives orders to each of his ships. Three different orders are available: the attack move which allows the ship to move and fire at the same time, the flank move which allows the ship to move to a better position without firing, and the focus fire which allows the ship to fire with an increased fire rate but only at a short move distance. <br><br>Once an order is selected, it's executed in four steps. First the player selects the horizontal movement and after that the vertical. The player also has to choose in what angle the ship should face and which enemy ship should be the primary target. For more advanced gameplay, the player can choose to turn on the manual mode which allows him to control how the ships will yaw, pitch and roll.<br><br>After all ships have got their orders, the player ends the turn and the action phase is launched. Here the player can only watch as the ships carry out their orders. There's no interactivity in the action phase (besides camera movement) so there's no way back once an order has been assigned. <br><br>Ships have heavy armour which is able to deflect most projectiles. However each ship has two weak spots, the rear and the bottom. Therefore flanking is a very important tactic since it allows the player to hit the rear side of the enemy ships. The vertical movement is also important since it allows the player to attack from below. The ships gain combat experience for each battle and this leads to the ship's veterancy level increasing. A ship with high veterancy is more effective in combat since it does more damage and has better armour performance. <br><br>In addition to the adventure mode described above, the game also has a skirmish mode which allows the player to jump straight into battle. The skirmish mode can be played both against another player or against the AI. In the skirmish mode it is possible to choose from any ship available in the game.

Enemies need to be transformed through music and attacking can only be done while the air after a jump. Jumping is done by swinging the guitar controller neck forward, which can be remapped to a button in the options. Enemies have five different facial features that are visual cues to how to defeat them. These refer to five different notes and the pattern needs to be repeated to be successful. A single facial feature can appear multiple times to make for longer patterns. Characters can also sprint and hang in the air.<br><br>New stages are unlocked by earning medals and sometimes they will need to be replayed multiple times. Ending a level is always done by escaping with a helicopter, and while going up it is possible to shoot a few bells to create a familiar melody. Other typical elements are air streams that hold characters in the air and drums that act as trampolines. The visual style makes everything look like a paper cutout and each character can be customized extensively in the options.

Levels are split up into different sections with checkpoints and are rendered in a 4:3 ratio with a pattern filling the rest of the background.<br><br>Singleplayer is available as a Story mode and Time Trials.

Description=It all begun in summer 2008 when the global demand for oil exceeded the production capacity of the oil companies. Now it's the year 2024. Oil is as good as none existent and alternate energy sources fail to provide what is needed. And to make it all worse, World War III is at hand since Russia and China formed the Red Star Alliance in order to fight the USA and Europe, now known as the Western Coalition for the last oil reserves on earth. You are a member of the Stray Dogs-squad and as a part of the Western Coalition it is your duty to fight off the Red Star Alliance and secure the oil.<br><br>The story of the campaign is told from the view of Wayne Andrews (but you don't play him). He's a member of the press that was assigned to accompany the Stray Dogs in order to make them heroes and give the people back at home something to look forward to. But war is unpredictable...<br><br>The goal of the game is always to conquer certain points on the map in order to move the frontline forward. But since you need to control at least two of those control points in order to advance, you also need to make sure that parts of your team defend the already converted point while you engage and take over the other ones.<br><br>To fight your enemies you've not only access to slightly futuristic equipment including exploding drones or a small radio-controlled tank but also to assault rifles, rocket launchers and other weapons that make a dent in the enemy armor. There are also several kinds of vehicles waiting for you. Ranging from jeeps over tanks to helicopters there's everything you need to dominate the battlefield.<br><br>In single player you only play one character which can use everything he finds on the battlefield. In multiplayer you choose different weapon load-outs and roles. A Dronetech for example makes use of the different radio-controlled vehicles in the game. During a round you can earn experience by killing enemies or capturing control points. Once you've gathered enough, you gain a level and get access to more equipment in your role but once the round has ended, these are reset and on the next map you once again start as a lowly Level 1 (of 3) in your role.

Players can explore a 14.000 km area of Northern America after the effects of global warming took place, rendering it desolate with abandoned cities, broken vehicles and almost no survivors. The goal is to win races, which provides fuel that can be exchanged for new vehicles. The game world is divided in nineteen separate zones that need to be unlocked by collecting stars  provided through winning career races. Up to 75 different types of vehicles can be unlocked during the course of the game. The vehicles can be modified with paint jobs and liveries.<br><br>Besides the regular career races, which are restricted to a specific vehicle class like ATV, buggy or motorbike, challenges are another event type in the game. These include for example chasing a helicopter through the terrain or trying to touch other vehicles within a given time limit. Next to the races and challenges that can be accessed right away, the game also offers the ability to drive freely in each of the zones to explore the environment. This is further encouraged by having to locate new liveries, vista points, and doppler trucks that show the locations of all items. The terrain is dense and the appropriate vehicle needs to be selected to explore freely. There are many extreme weather effects, such as pouring rain, snow, thunder storms and even hurricanes.<br><br>The general gameplay is arcade-like. Even though the terrain affects the performance, vehicles cannot be damaged and there is an option to respawn when crashing into objects. The roads are littered with obstacles and the game encourages to break away from the regular tracks to locate shortcuts and use jumps to cross large distances. Players can also create their own tracks through waypoints in the zone. A general HUD shows the race statistics and marks the course, along with a mini-map. FUEL can also be played online against up to 16 players.

Description=FunTown Mahjong is a simulation of the age old board game with titles. Unlike many other electronic conversions, it is the classic game and not the two-tile-matching casual variant. It can be played in singleplayer with anime-like avatars against AI opponents, online against human players, and there is a tutorial that explains the basics. The game is played around a table with the other opponents visible and the tiles are formed in the middle.<br><br>The game is played with 144 titles. These are divided into three categories (Suits, Honors, and Flowers). Suits again consist of three categories: Dots, Bamboos, and Characters, and each of those if further broken down in sets of nine, with numbers from one to nine. The Characters category comes with nine styles with four identical tiles for each one, and the same principle applies to Bamboos and Dots. The amount of Honors is much smaller: there are seven, one for each wind direction, and three dragons. Finally, Flowers consist of eight titles - four flowers and four seasons.<br><br>In the beginning of the game each players rolls dice and after that the tiles are distributed. To win the game, the player has to make a complete Meld. It consists of five sets of Straights (three suited tiles) or Triples (three tiles of the same), and a pair of Eyes (two tiles of the same). Players do not only need to watch the numbers, but the categories as well for combinations. When a complete Meld is formed, it looks like a human figure with eyes, a trunk, arms and legs (consisting of six combinations), but that structure is not shown in-game, it needs to be visualized internally.<br><br>A typical Mahjong is played with four players. One of them is the dealer. He provides sixteen tiles to each player and also makes the first move. The tiles are placed in front of the player, similar to Scrabble, and can freely be arranged. When it's the player's turn, he receives a new tile and at the end of the turn a tile needs to be discarded on the board in the middle. When you receive a flower tile you need to leave it face-up in front of your other tiles and draw another one to replace it. Four types of moves are possible: Chow, Pung, Kong, and Draw, for which the rules are out of the scope of this game entry. It is possible to keep track of the other players' progress by watching their exposed Kongs and Pungs.<br><br>Pulling the trigger changed the angle from top-down (best to view the board) to first-person. FunTown Mahjong is based on the Taiwanese variant with 16 tiles and does not include other rulesets, like Hong Kong or the official competitive Chinese rules for example.

Description=Gears of War is a tactical third-person shooter where the player controls Marcus Fenix, a member of Delta Squad, to save the human inhabitants of the fictional planet Sera from an enemy known as The Locust Horde. The story, played over 5 acts with 30 chapters in total, has the humans reunite their strength after fighting over cheap energy in the Pendulum Wars for many years, to face this new alien threat.<br><br>Unlike many other shooters, the emphasis is not on brute violence, but rather team-based actions and cover-dependent tactics. Gameplay requires to look for cover options all the time, from which the player then attacks, along with turns and rolls to quickly pop out. By holding a button, a "roadie run" is performed, to sprint to another location. Marcus is part of a full squad, but another human player can take on the role of Dominic Santiago to fight cooperatively (split-screen, system link or online). At times, the paths will even be split up to face different challenges. Players can only hold two weapons, a sidearm, and a few grenades. There is a selection of submachine guns, sniper and assault riles, grenades, grenade launchers, and pistols, but the main gun is the COG Lancer Assault Rifle, which can also be used as a chainsaw bayonet in close combat. There are also a few exotic weapons, such as the Torque Bow with explosive arrows, or the Hammer of Dawn, to make an orbiting satellite fire a laser at targeted enemies.<br><br>All weapons need to be reloaded manually. By timely pressing a button on a meter, the weapon is reloaded, with more damage and at a faster rate with perfect timing, or it gets jammed when timed poorly. Instead of health bar, the game has the Crimson Omen, a cog-shaped icon that fills up with blood when the player sustains damage.<br><br>Next to the Co-op multiplayer, there is also Versus, with three game modes: Warzone (deathmatch), Execution (deathmatch, but with the addition of certain "fatalities" to take out enemies completely) and Assassination (team played focused on killing the opponent's team leader).<br><br>The Windows version includes 5 new single-player chapters, 3 multiplayer maps, new game modes and a game editor (not present in the 360 version).

Covers can now be deformed, but not taken away completely.<br><br>Next to single-player, there is a cooperative campaign mode (split-screen or online) and each player can set a different difficulty level (based on health and damage). In the regular campaign mode, the simple controls to guide AI team mates have been removed entirely. The multiplayer portion offers fifteen maps (including remakes of existing ones). Online games offers a matchmaking system where players are matched according to their rank. Some of the new multiplayer modes are Submission (get an unfriendly AI character back to the capture point), Guardian (team deathmatch with one player is the VIP - similar to Assassination in the previous game - ; when the player is alive, the other can respawn infinitely, but - new in this mode - when he dies the other players are on their last life), Wingman (ten players are split in teams of two, both as the same character), and King of the Hill (previously only featured in the PC version of the first game).<br><br>There is a cooperative Horde mode where up to five players play together in 50 waves of the Locust horde. More camera modes are present in the multiplayer games and players can take photos of the action to upload them to the official website.

Description=Gel: Set & Match is a puzzle game where creatures need to match wobbly, jelly blocks. It is the sequel to Fuzzee Fever by the same developer. Players can choose from a number of creatures and customize their appearance. The game is played from an almost top-down view. The creatures are able to move in any direction and need to form matches of four blocks or more of the same colour, in any pattern, as long as touch vertically or horizontally. To do that creatures can pick up certain blocks and then put them down near others to create a match. Alternatively they can throw the block and while it slides it can form a match where it passes, even if it does not stop at that point. Blocks can also be pushed around. That way it is possible to create multiple matches at once. The blocks do not melt right away, so there are a few seconds where it can be picked up again to throw it somewhere else, forming combo chains.<br><br>The game offers three modes: Puzzle, Action and Battle. In Puzzle the goal is to clear the blocks on a number of pre-defined boards in a set amount of moves to progress. There are about 120 levels and when a number of levels is cleared under par in a single stage, a bonus area is unlocked. In Action a creature needs to clear a path of blocks for a bulldozer moving at a steady pace. The blocks cannot touch the bulldozer and it is possible to have it speed up when a large area has been cleared. The third mode, Battle, is further divided into three game types: Fever Points, Volleybomb and Emblems. These are competitive game modes against other players.<br><br>In the Action and Puzzle mode melted blocks often leave behind stars that can be selected. These can be exchanged in the item shop for new customization options for the characters. The game supports both offline and online multiplayer games, cooperative (for two players) or competitive (up to four players).

Take the role of a lone spaceship as you combat swarms of assorted brightly colored shapes which attack you with their own different patterns.  There's the basic Pinwheels, the unstable Black Holes, which attempt to suck you (and enemies) in, the long, dangerous Snakes, to name but a few.  Each enemy explodes in a dazzling shower of sparks, and it can quickly become difficult to navigate through space as you try to avoid enemies and ignore the explosions.<br><br>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved actually contains two games in one.  The first version is Retro, which was originally included as a secret game in Project Gotham Racing 2.  Retro features a 4:3 aspect ratio, and fewer graphical effects.<br><br>The other, more popular version of the game is Evolved, which was also included in Project Gotham Racing 3. This version of the game can be played in a 16:9 aspect ratio, and features more intense graphics and special effects. Also, you can only get a maximum of nine ships and nine lives, while there was an unlimited number in the original game. Finally, the playing area is smaller, not revealing the entire field, but scrolling has been added instead.<br><br>However, the core game is the same for both versions: shoot everything, and don't get shot or hit yourself.  You control your ship with the left analog stick, and fire your weapon in any direction by using the right analog stick. Your ship's weapon automatically upgrades every 2,500 points, to help you destroy ships more quickly.  here are also 'smart bombs', which can be activated by using either the L or R trigger button.  Smart Bombs clear the field of all enemies - however, many more will quickly take their place!

Description=Geon: Emotions is a fast game played on a semi-transparent double-sided grid. Each side provides a playfield for a player or a computer-controlled opponent. The goal of the game is to score a goal by touching a target on the opponent's side. The player controls a cube that can be moved around on the grid to collect pellets. The opponent does the same, but the player cannot pick up those of the opponent. Collecting pellets is done in Pac-Man-style and charges the cube with emotes. When fully charged, players can move to the side of the grid to flip over and enter the opponent's area.<br><br>Games are based around emotions. Before starting players choose one of the eight available emotions: rage, passion, fear, courage, melancholy, rapture, envy or bliss.

Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?  If the answer is yes then don't wait another minute, pick up the phone and call the professionals...GHOSTBUSTERS!!!  <br><br>Ghostbusters: The Video Game is the first game in almost 20 years based on the Ghostbusters universe and features the actual voices of the original cast: Bill Murray (Peter Venkman), Dan Aykroyd (Ray Stantz), Harold Ramis (Egon Spengler) and Ernie Hudson (Winston Zeddemore), as well as Annie Potts, who reprises her role as Janine Melnitz, and William Atherton, reprising his role as Walter Peck, the team's nemesis from the first film. It also features the soundtrack from the first two films, as composed by the late Elmer Bernstein.<br><br>The story (written by Aykroyd and Ramis) takes place in 1991, two years after the Ghostbusters vanquished Vigo and prevented him from taking over the world. Since then, the Ghostbusters have been overrun by the increasing number of spirits appearing in the city and has decided to add a fifth member to the team. This is where the player will step in, taking the place of the nameless "new cadet" of the Ghostbusters, hired to test Egon's new experimental equipment.<br><br>Just as the "new cadet" is being initiated into the Ghostbusters, all hell breaks loose in the city as a massive amount of spirit energy has threatened to tear New York apart and it is up to the player along with his new employers to stop a familiar menace. The player will follow the Ghostbusters as they travel through familiar locales and fight familiar enemies including Slimer and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man using authentic equipment including the famous proton pack and spirit traps to catch the many ghosts swarming throughout the stages. To do so the player must use the proton beam to wear down the ghost and once it gets weak enough, the beam will automatically latch onto the spirit and the player must set out a trap and guide the ghost towards it and keep it from escaping.<br><br>There is also new equipment to be used that can be unlocked during later levels as well as being able to upgrade equipped items by acquiring money for catching and destroying ghosts (however money is also deducted for the amount of destruction the player causes on each level). The player can also use the P.K.E. meter to track spirits, as well as scan various objects, ghosts and residue left behind to fill in the Tobin Spirit Guide. The slime cannon from the second film is also present which is used to free possessed people, allowing the player to safely catch ghosts without harming the person.<br><br>The story is told through both pre-rendered and in-game cutscenes and differs from its Wii and PS2 iterations which features more of a cartoonish look and feel to the overall game. There are also online multiplayer modes that allow players to meet up with friends online and team up.

Description=Gin Rummy is an electronic simulation of the card game of the same name. Generally it is a two-player game, but this version supports up to four players online with teams of two playing against each other. A standard deck of 52 cards is used and they each receive a ranking, from ace (one point) to the three face cards (Jack, Queen King) worth ten points. The dealer deals ten cards to each player. Two piles are made in the middle: a discard pile (face-up) and the stock pile (face-down). Each turn players draw one card, from any pile, and also have to discard one card. The goal of the game is to score most points by forming melds (consists of sets and runs) and eliminating deadwood. A set is three or four cards of the same rank (three times a five for instance) and a run is three or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order (four, five, and six of spades for instance). The useless cards that remain in the player's hand are the deadwood.<br><br>The game can be ended by a player who has a hand of sets and runs and the points value of the remaining deadwood totals equal or less than ten points. This is called knocking. Knocking is optional when the above requirements are met and required when the deadwood equals zero (called "going Gin"). At that moment the other player still has a chance to win. When a player announces to knock, he lays his hand out with the melds and deadwood separated. The other player can then reduce his deadwood by laying off any cards that fit into the first player's meld, thereby reducing his deadwood. A lay-off is not allowed when the first player went Gin. After that, the points are counted, along with different types of bonus scores.<br><br>The game is played from a first-person perspective and includes a tutorial to get familiar with the rules of Gin Rummy. The game supports the Vision camera. While playing cards can also be sorted manually to get a good overview. The game includes different variants of Gin, each with their own rules:<br><br>1.

Description=On New Year's Eve 1958 Hyman Roth not only celebrated his birthday, he also celebrated the successful expansion of the Corleone family, successfully lead by Don Michael Corleone for fifteen years now, into Cuba. But the celebrations did not last long when suddenly "la revolucion" started and all hell breaks loose. Michael and Hyman manage to escape with most of the other family members but Aldo Trapani (the main protagonist in The Godfather) gets killed - just in time for five new families to threaten the Corleone family's control over New York, Florida and Las Vegas. As one of Aldo Trapani's closest soldiers, the player jumps into the role of Dominic to help Michael and the Corleone family win the war as well as to build a family of his now.<br><br>Looking over Dominic's shoulder, the player moves freely through three cities depicting a New York, Florida and Cuba from the late '50s/early '60s traveling between them by airplane. Connected by the main storyline, the main goal of Dominic is to grow his family and destroy the other five families. This is done in two main steps: Taking over businesses and killing so-called "Made Man". Taking over a business is done the same way as in the predecessor: Enter the shop/joint/factory/construction site, fight through the enemy guards and find the person with the Godfather-sign over his head. That is the one the player needs to threaten until he gives up his resistance and pays his dues to Dominic from now on instead of the other family.<br><br>Each business owner has his own weak spot as well as a breaking point. A weak spot ranges from destroying inventory to punching him or her in the face, and gives a 25% bonus on the monetary outcome. But if the player pressures the owner to much, he either dies from the torture or reaches his breaking point. Then he gets aggressive, cannot be intimidated anymore and attacks without mercy. Is the intimidation successful however, the player gets a one-time cash advance and gains money from the joint every day. In addition there are several rackets combined in a crime ring. Once the player controls it, he immediately gains a bonus until he loses one of the rackets in the crime ring. This goes for his enemy as well. When the player takes over a business of a crime ring, the bonuses like bullet-proof vests for all family members or brass knuckles for higher melee damage are instantly removed. That's why the enemy families do not just sit by and let Dominic take their businesses one by one. So the player has to hire guards to protect the businesses. In case of an attack, he can also send one of his soldiers to help in the defense.<br><br>This soldier or so-called "Made Man", is initially discovered and invited by the player to join his family while hanging out at the various safe houses and rackets. Each of them has a specialization. While one might be good at planting bombs, the other is a safe cracker very useful to rob banks and loot all the various safes in the city to get an achievement. As the player progresses through the game, he cannot only hire more family members, but can also promote a few of his soldiers. This allows them to learn a second and even third profession on top of their initial one. It is also possible to upgrade certain skills like Survival (stay longer conscious once out of health) of a family member, in return for hard-earned cash. When a made man is downed by enemy fire, he does not immediately get transferred to the next hospital or police station. Instead there is a time window in which everyone can revive the other with a shot of adrenaline. If it's too late, the player respawns at the hospital/police station and loses some money while his made man is out of the picture for a certain amount of time. This is also true for the player if he has a medic on his team, otherwise he goes directly to jail or the hospital.<br><br>The amount of time it takes them to get back on your side can be reduced by using favors. Favors are handed out by random people with a sign over their head on the streets and by high-ranking officials. Both give the player a mission which can involve killing or beating someone up, blowing a business (even one of the player's) to hell or something similar. The difference is, that the favor of an official can be saved for later like immediately rebuilding a bombed business. Favors of random people instead come in the form of money rewards or kill conditions.<br><br>Kill conditions are needed to get an enemy made man. Just shooting them only puts them in the hospital. To take them permanently out the picture, the player needs to make an example of the man by fulfilling the kill condition. Shoving a made man from the roof of a building, putting a bullet between his eyes and such are examples for such kill conditions. Once all made men of a family have been eliminated forever, the player can deal the final blow to the rival family: killing their Don and blowing up their compound. All while dealing with the police that hunts you down just for forgetting to silence a witness of a crime.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer mode that ties in with the single player campaign. Upon entering the multiplayer mode, the player chooses one of his family members he has hired in single-player and takes on his role. During his participation in the four game modes Team Deathmatch, Demolition Assault (blow up three objects in enemy territory), FireStarter (torch barrels, gas and propane tanks to rack up scoring multiplicators), Safecracker (bust a safe and hold the position for more points), the player then earns honor points for his family member. These are used in single player to buy a new weapon license for that soldier, which allows him to use the higher level weapons the player finds scattered around the city and can be handed to him.

They represent the buttons on the player's controller and they need to be pressed in a timely fashion when they are in the target circle in the middle of the screen. For every timed beat a beatnik is earned, building up a combo. Missing one fills up the penalty bar and sometimes multiple buttons need to be pressed together to form a chord. The game's music mostly consists of hip hop songs. There are different characters to choose from, along with three difficulty levels.<br><br>At certain points in a song, a puzzle circle of beatniks of different colours appears around the dancer. Players need to shoot a number of beatniks into the ones on the ring, forming a group of three beatniks or more of the same colour who then disappear. The amount of beatniks provided is based on how many times the timing was "perfect" in the rhythm section. Eliminating them moves the other beatniks on the ring to fill the space and this can cause chain reactions. With a huge elimination the penalty bar is depleted. If the ring gets too long, the player cannot eliminate the beatniks, or the penalty bar is maxed out, the game is over. The puzzle can be turned and the beatniks can be shuffled on the ring.<br><br>Multiplayer is supported both locally and online with different types of modes for two players. In the co-op mode both players play the rhythm section together and the worst one determines the amount of beatniks provided. Players take turns doing the puzzle section. In the versus mode players go head-to-head with the same gameplay of the singleplayer mode, but with the addition of power-ups that appear in the beatniks circles. They are acquired by knocking them out of the circle with a match. Power-ups include spraypaint to cover the other player's target circle or a hammer that adds five beatniks to the opponent's puzzle.

Description=The Golden Compass is an adaptation of the 2007 movie of the same, which in turn is based on the novel Northern Lights, the first in the His Dark Materials trilogy by British novelist Philip Pullman.<br><br>The game is set in a fantastical parallel universe where the soul of person resides out of the body and lives in the form of animals known as dmons. The main character is Lyra Belacqua. Her best friend Roger is kidnapped by evil Gobblers and her uncle Lord Asriel is imprisoned when he discovers evidence that proves the existence of Dust particles, much to the dismay of the Magisterial representatives who rule the world as a dogmatic theocracy and do not allow people to contradict their doctrine. Lyra has to leave the safe haven that is Jordan College in Oxford to right the situation.<br><br>In typical 3rd-person action gameplay, Lyra needs to navigate the different environments. She excels at moving around with acrobatic actions and when enemies appear she relies on her wit, hiding behind objects or searching an escape route. When she is spotted, she can use one of the four collectibles to escape from a tricky situation. Health is represented as "courage" and a large extent of courage helps solving the puzzles. She can also play a Deception mini-game to outwit characters and gain additional courage.<br><br>Two other characters provide assistance her during her quest. The first is Pan, Lyra's dmon and the manifestation of her spirit. Pan can transform into up to four different forms, gradually discovered during the quest. The basic Ermine form allows Pan to chew through ropes and reveals the areas where Lyra needs to solve puzzles or move around. The Sloth form introduces swinging to grab hold of branches or reach areas hard to access. The third form, Hawk, lets Lyra glide from great heights. She can also send out Pan in this form to retrieve objects at difficult locations. The final Wildcat form has Lyra slide down from special surfaces, climb nets and it provides a dash move to evade enemies.<br><br>Brute strength is represented by the second support character Iorek Byrnison, an armoured bear known as panserbjrne. He has most of the physical attacks. Next to health (replenished by bloodmoss) he has an armour gauge, filled up by gathering sky armour. Collected rage orbs fill up a rage meter, which introduces a special attack when maxed out. Pan is always by Lyra's side, while Iorek joins the party later in the game and he is not always present.<br><br>Lyra's journal stores her tasks, information about key locations and a section for the Alethiometer, the golden compass. It is a device that reveals the answer to any question when operated by a trained user. It contains four needles - three to construct a question and fourth for the answer. To ask questions and solve puzzles, Lyra needs to play the Divining game. It consists of three sessions where Lyra needs to match symbols to keep the focus (a circle of light) centred on the device, by pressing a key or button to spin a hand in a timely fashion. The meaning of the different symbols is revealed during the course of the game, by interacting with objects and characters. Conversations often introduce mini-games to keep the talking going.<br><br>Each of the characters can pick up objects that grant new abilities such as new forms, a slow spell, double damage or more insight into the workings of the Alethiometer.

It then returns and reaches a coloured part - from red to green, and pressing it there a third time determines the accuracy. Pressing B, the maximum distance can also be extended.<br><br>On the right a meter is built up based on how well you do on the different holes. Using that meter a maximum of twelve seconds of focus can be applied: aftertouch, where you can still direct the course of the ball and make it move more towards the hole. While putting using focus can be used to preview the putt. The singleplayer mode consists of a tournament of eighteen holes. Multiplayer is supported locally and online for up to four players, split up in teams of two.

Description=Grand Theft Auto IV is the ninth title and the fourth main game in one of the most successful and iconic series in the history of videogames, and it is also the first title for the seventh generation of consoles.<br><br>Following the tradition of the 3D transition of the series, GTA IV is entirely located in one of the three cities of the original GTA, Liberty City, but now in present time, and with an environment constructed much like GTA III but bigger and more detailed. Liberty City is a virtual city based heavily on New York, where the player's avatar, a Serbian ex-soldier called Niko Bellic, has to gain respect, welfare and power throughout the game. His main goal however is to offer services in exchange for information locate a few Serbians from his past who betrayed him.<br><br>Like in most GTA games, the rise to power of the mobster apprentice begins with parts of the whole map inaccessible. He starts in Broker (based on Brooklyn), and, in order to access the other three districts of the city (based on the other major boroughs of New York City), the player has to make progress in the storyline. To do this, GTA IV has the usual structure based on missions, but with the major difference that, this time, there is not a "mission state" which prevents Nico from doing anything else. In GTA IV, the player can engage in various missions at the same time, and even has free access to the non-mission features of the game while doing one.<br><br>Free roaming is also a defining feature of GTA games. Most of the usual elements of exploration and interaction with the city are included in GTA IV, but they have been enhanced regarding previous games. Niko can cause mayhem in the city, hijack cars, listen to radio stations, observe the behavior of the citizens, enter thematic buildings, work as vigilante, taxi driver, ambulance driver, and much more. But he can also watch television programs or connect to the Internet, look for criminals in the police department database from a police car, walk from the ground floor of a building to the very roof, observe the improved A.I. of the pedestrians, hire taxi cabs to go where he wants, use the mobile phone extensively (like as an event reminder, for example), hire a prostitute, go to a strip club, and a lot of other things.<br><br>In addition, this GTA game is one of the first games using the euphoria motion engine, an alternate middleware solution much like ragdoll physics which makes all people in the GTA IV world move realistically depending on the situation around them. For example, every time Niko enters a car, a different animation will be generated depending on his position relative to the car.<br><br>Some features may be missing (like no drivable airplanes in this case, except for a helicopter), while many others become more complex or are totally new, but, summarizing, GTA IV follows the evolution of the major titles in the series. That is, any new GTA game has more features, is more detailed and is technically improved. The most notable addition for this edition is multiplayer, the first time for the console versions. The same free-roaming environment is offered for up to 16 players in 15 modes. Certain modes narrow down the environment to make sure players remain somewhat in each other's vicinity.<br><br>Compared to the console releases, the windows release features high resolution graphics, customizable multiplayer for up to 32 players, a video editor to capture and edit in-game footage and the possibility to customize the radio station Independence FM with own songs.

Description=The Lost and Damned is the first expansion pack for Grand Theft Auto IV, exclusively for the Xbox 360 version of the game. It has been made available as DLC (downloadable content) and requires the original game to play.<br><br>Set in Liberty City, just like the original game, there is a new storyline with a new protagonist, Johnny Klebitz. He is vice-president of the biker gang The Lost Motorcycle Club. While the president Billy Grey is in rehab, he takes over and tries to work out deals with the other gangs. When Grey eventually returns he resorts to his violent tactics, making it difficult to keep it running. Billy and Johnny clash for the leadership, while dealing with the other gangs, especially Angels of Death. The original game is not ignored however, as Niko Bellic not only appears in the game, but even becomes an important part of the storyline. Parts of the actions in the game are also influenced by the events in the original game, suggesting that both stories happen around the same time.<br><br>The game starts in a club house in Alderney, in the Western part of the city where Niko only got access late in the game. The entire city is available at once. Contrary to the first game and in the spirit of the biker gang Johnny's in, there is much more focus on team work with the other members. Their health bars are also shown on the screen. When a member dies in action, he needs to be replaced by a less experienced youngster, making it harder to progress and encouraging the player to look after his peers. There are also strict rules in the gang, especially when riding around in a set formation is required. Members can be called to provide weapons and stealing other vehicles is less encouraged. Johnny starts on a custom bike that is virtually indestructible, though it can be replaced. Most of the new vehicles are bikes, but there are also a few new trucks and vans.<br><br>The clubhouse offers new minigames such as arm wrestling, pool and card games. There are new sites on the internet, new TV shows and three new radio stations with a focus on hard rock. Next to the regular storyline there are challenges based on racing or gang wars. The new weapons are a grenade launcher, an assault shotgun, a pool cue, a pipe bomb and an automatic 9mm.<br><br>Six new multiplayer modes are introduced: races, club business, lone wolf biker (Full Throttle and Chopper Vs.

Description=The heart of GRID is the career-mode called GRID World. Divided into the three regions USA, Europe and Japan, the player has to earn money and prestige points to move up into a higher license category which then gives him access to more and harder racing events. These events are divided into categories like normal races, Drift-events, Destruction Derbies and even the famous 24 hours race in Le Mans.<br><br>But of course not every car is suitable for every event so there are several different series to chose from. So while the player drives a tuned car for the Drift- or Racing-events in Japan, muscle cars await him in for the Destruction Derbies in the USA or Formel 3000 racers in Europe. Each car also handles very differently. Of course the player needs to buy the suitable car first before he can enter a tournament. There he can decide if he wants to buy a brand new car or go over to eBay Motors and look for a solid used car which of course cost less but has already seen some crashes and might not provide the best possible performance.<br><br>To earn the money to buy a car for a event, the player can complete so-called Driver Offers. These are offers by other racing teams to take part in an event and see it through. But there are also bonus objectives like "Finish before Team Top Secret" which grant the player additional cash if he successfully completes them.<br><br>Besides money the player also earns prestige points. These are required to unlock the next higher license category in the corresponding country. Of course tournaments give way more points than completing Driver Offers but the player can also get a few more points by adjusting the realism settings before the race. The higher the realism is, the higher the point gain will be after successful finishing the event. These settings include things like a difficulty level, traction assistant or how many flashbacks the player has available during a race. These flashbacks are similar to the Sands of Time in the Prince of Persia-Series. If the player for example drifts out into the gravel pit, he can activate the instant replay, rewind time a little bit and then immediately reenter the race at that point and try to avoid the crash.

A portion of the songs of Guitar Hero: World Tour, Guitar Hero Smash Hits and Band Hero can be imported in exchange for a small fee per song.<br><br>In the Band Lobby players can assemble a party of local and remore players to form a band, play the Career mode or opt for Quickplay. Most of the competitive multiplayer modes are carried over from former versions, along with two new ones: Party Play (random song selection with the option to join and leave at will using any instrument) and RockFest, a band mode for up to four (local) or up to eight (online) players with a variety of submodes. The songs are divided in smaller portions and for each section the players are rewarded based on a variety of conditions.<br><br>General new features introduced to the gameplay include drop-in/drop-out play, where it is possible to join in the middle of a song or stop playing without interrupting gameplay. There is also a new Challenges section in the Career mode.<br><br>The different game versions are identical, except for the PS2 version that lacks online game modes and downloadable content, drop-in/drop-out play and song challenges. It is also limited to two instruments and the multitap is not supported. The Wii version is very similar to the major console versions, including downloadable content on SD cards, multiplayer through the global Wii address book, and the Mii Freestyle mode from the previous game. It also supports interaction with the Nintendo DS to edit videos and provides access to the Roadie Battle mode, similar to the main battle mode of Guitar Hero III, where players complete mini-games on the Nintendo DS to sabotage the players on the console.

Description=Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is considered an expansion of Guitar Hero III and it is the first title in the series primarily focused on a single band. The gameplay concept is similar to the game it is based on. About 60% of the included tracks are by Aerosmith, while the others have influenced or have opened for the band (Run-D.M.C., The Kings, Lenny Kravitz, ...). Four songs were re-recorded by the band directly for the game and they also performed as motion capture actors for their 3D models. The majority of the tracks consists of master recordings.<br><br>The prominent game segment is the career mode where players go through the band's history, from the earlier seventies to 2001. Times of internal issues are not touched upon. Players initially start as Joe Perry but can later also unlock the other band members Brad Whitford and Tom Hamilton. The career has been divided into six tiers with five tracks, each based on a period in the band's history. There are also encores when a tier has been completed, and two opening acts playing as another band. After each tier, bonus material is shown such as trivia or video sequences and interviews.<br><br>Songs are unlocked gradually and become available in the other modes, identical to Guitar Hero III (Quickplay, Cooperative, Competitive + Battle modes). Only the cooperative career mode is absent. The menus have been redesigned and there are new venues, based on historical performances. There are 41 songs in total, of which 31 can be unlocked in the career mode and an additional 10 in the vault.<br><br>The game is available in a bundle with a custom guitar or as a single game release. For the PS2 version there are two bundles, one with a single, wireless guitar and another with two, wired guitars.

Description=Guitar Hero II, the follow-up to the PS2-only game Guitar Hero, expands upon the gameplay and features of the original game. As a wannabe rockstar, you need to play songs by pressing combinations of five fret buttons on a guitar-shaped controller, while working the strum bar, along with an optional whammy bar for distortion. The sequel contains 64 songs, of which 40 have been licensed. One of the tracks was discovered through a contest at beaguitarhero.com, where unlicensed bands could send in a demo to be included in the game. Most of the tracks have been covered in-studio, but a few use original recordings.<br><br>The career mode has been revamped as a high school battle where you need to make your way to the top. Every venue is now represented by a different city. There are also encore performances, and unlockables can still be bought in the shop. A completely new addition is the practice mode (Shred School). When you keep getting stumped by a single track, you can train in this mode. The background music is dropped, you can choose a certain section to practice, and there four types of speeds available, to slowly get the hang of difficult passages.<br><br>In the multiplayer mode, you can still play the traditional mode from the first game, where sections are traded off between players.  The co-op mode is new: both players play the same song at the same time, but one is given the lead guitar, while the other handles the bass or rhythm guitar. Unlike the traditional mode, you can fail and both player share the score, rock meter and multiplier. To activate star power (a short power-up mode where the score multiplier is doubled, built up in a meter by playing a number of star-shaped notes without flaws and best saved for difficult sections) both players need to raise the guitar at the same time. You cannot practice together in this mode, but the different sections are available in the singleplayer practice mode. The final mode is called Face-Off. Here, both players play every single note at the same time. In the multiplayer mode, each player can now choose an individual difficulty level. Upon completing Face-Off, Pro Face-Off becomes available, where both players need to use the same difficulty level.<br><br>Other additions are the introduction of three-button chords, the use of hammer-ons and pull-offs (holding one note while playing another and vice versa) is smoother, and the screen now shakes if you break a note streak (only of the side of the player who makes the mistake in the multiplayer mode).

Description=Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is the third full game in the Guitar Hero series and fourth game overall. The gameplay remains similar to the previous games: using a guitar-shaped controller, you need to coordinate pressing the five fret buttons and strumming to the scrolling notes on screen. Missing notes will cause your performance meter to drop; if the meter drops too low then the performance is a failure and you will need to try again. This edition of the game features 71 new songs to play from various artists including Cream, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, Santana, Sonic Youth, Weezer, and many more. In addition to the available songs the game also features &quot;boss battles&quot; against famous guitarists such as Slash, Tom Morello and Lou the Devil. Several game modes are available including career mode, co-op mode, and multiplayer mode. In addition to the main game modes, training and practice modes are available to aid in learning the game or figuring out a tricky passage in a song.<br><br>In career mode you play the part of a wanna-be rock star. Beginning with easier songs in small venues, you need to successfully complete tracks to make your way up to a superstar. Each venue you play requires a certain number of songs to be performed before you can move on to the next larger venue. Successful completion of songs also earns money which can be used to unlock characters, outfits, new guitars, and other bonuses.<br><br>The co-op career mode is similar to the single player variation, except two players work together (one on lead guitar, the other on bass or rhythm guitar) to complete songs. <br><br>The multiplayer game modes allow two players to compete against each other. In the Face-Off variation, two players take turns performing a song. The Pro Face-Off variation allows two players to compete at the same time playing the exact same note chart. Finally, in the battle mode each player can earn power ups by performing well which can be used to disrupt the other player.

The members also did motion capture sessions for the avatars in the game.<br><br>The music selection consists of 28 master recordings and 21 additional songs by others selected by the band. Bonus features include various videos and trivia about the songs.

Description=Guitar Hero: World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.<br><br>While playing, a rock meter keeps track of successive notes hit (one for each player), which leads to score multipliers. When the meter becomes too low, other players can make up for this on a shared, general performance meter. In the same vein players share a star power meter, built up by playing through certain sections successfully, that any player can access.<br><br>There are four difficulty levels and a new beginner mode where notes are made as easy as possible to introduce the concept to new players. Most of the game content is centered around a Career mode (both Solo and Band) where players start a new band, choose an avatar an instrument, and then play different gigs unlocking new songs along the way. Completing tracks earns money that can be spent on outfits or instruments. There are once again encore songs and "boss challenges" where the lead guitar enters a duel. This is similar to the battles in Guitar Hero III, but without the power-ups. Instead it returns to a call-and-response mechanic similar to the Face-Off mode. Bands consists of offline players but online members can join as well. Complete bands can take on others online through the Battle of the Bands mode.<br><br>Through the Music Studio editor new songs can be composed and shared using the GHTunes service (not for the PS2). In this edition avatars can be customized with more detail using the Create-a-Rocker mode. Major artists have licensed their appearance in the game. The Wii version contains a Mii Freestyle mode where players can use their Mii characters in-game and compose songs through motions of the Wii remote and the Nunchuk controller.<br><br>There are several bundles for the game, based on the amount of instruments included, but also a stand-alone version as most of the versions are compatible with the controllers of previous games and even some of Rock Band.

Description=Gum Drop: Celestial Frontier is a top-down arena shooter set in space, based on the swinging attacks gameplay concept also featured in xWUNG, Hammerfight and STUDIO EVIL's game G. In different levels, the player's ship need to survive, protect the base ship and take out enemies to progress. The ship can be controlled directly, but cannot fire. Instead, multiple grappling beams can be fired to grab pieces of debris, enemy ships or bonuses. These can then be swung around using the mouse to hit opponents. The most important weapon is S.M.A.S.H. These stones stay with the player over the level and can be let loose to have them follow the ship around. Some of the bonuses can be connected to S.M.A.S.H into a single, powerful swinging weapon. Some of them provide a gravity field, a shotgun, missiles, a beam, or make the ship faster. At any time, the beams can be disabled to collect different items or swing a ship far away.<br><br>The base ship moves independently from the player's actions, fires through turrets, and needs to be protected at all times. The player's ship can be repaired docking the base ship, but this temporarily disables the turrets, leaving it open for attacks. Levels are unlocked progressively and they all take place in bright, enclosed arenas. The game keeps track of the player's high scores.

Some are earned during the missions, others can be bought and sold for cash in the towns.<br><br>The GTA reference is reflected in the main means of transportation: horses. There are different animals to find with extensive movement options. Go on wild chases, spurt, gallop, do skid attacks, or trample your enemies. Give them some rest from time to time, or you will wear them down to death. In the melee combat, you can do roll maneuvers, use objects to provide cover, grab your opponents and even scalp them. You are free to steer away from the main storyline and explore the giant landscape, with towns, deserts, mountains, wilderness and caves.

Description=Hail to the Chimp is a political satire/party game in the vein of the Mario Party series.  In the "Animal Kingdom", the King Lion has disappeared after being implicated in a series of scandals and as a result, animals across the kingdom demand a new king by holding an election.  The election becomes a stalemate, leading the lowliest form of animals, Clams, with the deciding vote.  As a result, each candidate must compete in a free-for-all to get the Clam vote and become the new president.<br><br>The gameplay mostly consists of competing on themed party boards, such as ships, a volcano and a snowy tundra, collecting clams to score points and raise their overall vote count while avoiding obstacles and attacks from rival opponents.  The results of each contest are showed in a news-themed stats screen, showing overall stats presented by animal newscasters such as a turtle and a woodpecker named Woodchuck Chumley.  Players can also form alliances after certain stages and recruit rival candidates to help them in later stages, only later to turn against them as well.<br><br>There are ten animals to choose (a hippo, armadillo, polar bear, octopus, platypus, and the game's namesake chimp) in the multiplayer mode, which has four human opponents competing against each other, but in the single-player "Campaign" mode, the player competes in ten stages, each themed for a certain animal during the game, competing in a series events aimed towards that character that they are controlling. There are also four opponents during the "Campaign" mode, but instead has three CPU opponents in place of human opponents.

Like the rest of the series, it is a sci-fi/military-themed first-person shooter with an emphasis on vehicles and an extensive multiplayer mode in addition to the single-player campaign.<br><br>As before, the series' signature shield system is used where, rather than health, you have a force field of sorts which loses power as you are attacked.  You needn't pick up anything to refill it, only take cover for several seconds.  If you can avoid being attacked, the shield will recharge on its own.<br><br>Vehicles are again present.  These are human and alien transport which can be driven or ridden in with another player or AI doing the driving.  Halo 3 adds numerous new types of vehicles, notably a massive mobile command center called the Elephant and a human VTOL aircraft called the Hornet.  Enemies with good timing can board a vehicle, kicking out the occupant.<br><br>Also as before, you are limited to one weapon in hand (or one in each hand for some of the smaller guns) and one on back-up with both human and alien weapons available.  Weapons can be fired or used to club someone for a melee hit.  There are several new weapons, including the gravity hammer, which is a massive hammer for one-hit kills in close combat.  When using a single weapon, your second trigger throws grenades, which have a new spike type in addition to the basic sticky and frag ones from previous games.  Turrets are back, which are mounted guns with a new missile pod variant and the added ability to rip them off their moorings and carry them around in 3rd person view.<br><br>There is a new feature called equipment where you get objects with particular effects, such as a gravity lift, a shield drain field, a shield recharge field, land mines and a bubble shield which can be penetrated by players, but not gunfire.  One piece of equipment can be carried at a time and it can be deployed anywhere.<br><br>All the multiplayer game types from Halo 2 are back.  This includes the standard fps games like slayer (essentially deathmatch), capture the flag, assault (reverse ctf), territories and king of the hill (territories with a single point).  There are also Halo-specific games, like oddball, where you must hold an object the longest time and juggernaut, where one player gets specials powers.  Only they can score points.  If you kill that player, you become the juggernaut.  Two new games are added: VIP, where you are tasked with killing a specific player on the other team and must protect your own VIP, and infection, which is a human team vs a zombie team and humans are infected and brought to the other team as they are killed.  There are also dozens of variants of these, such as crazy king, which is king of the hill with a moving hill, mad dash which is a juggernaut games where the object is to get to waypoint instead of kill people and single-weapon versions of slayer.  You can make your own custom game types by manipulating a a number of variables such as weapons, goals and player stats.<br><br>This is augmented by Forge, which is a map editor.  While it doesn't have the ability to change level geometry, Forge can be used to completely change object placements.

They can give give them a tank, for instance, or create a barrier and levitate it along as mobile cover.<br><br>The campaign mode contains a number of new features as well.  The players now control distinct characters in co-op rather than the Chief just having an identical twin, the player limit has been expanded to four and it is now playable online.  There is a metagame where you score points in the campaign (used for some of the achievements) and the skulls from Halo 2 have been expanded with a checklist and additional features, such as unlocking extra armor for use in multiplayer and additional dialogue featured throughout the game.<br><br>The ability to customize your appearance has been expanded from Halo 2 with not only a longer list of emblems to place on your armor and the ability to pick a third color, but multiple armor variants which can be mixed and matched and the ability to use a female voice.<br><br>Other new features include a theater where you can re-watch games you or others played from the viewpoint of any player-character or in third-person or with a free camera.

Description=Halo: Combat Evolved is a first-person shooter with considerable driving elements and the first game in the popular Halo series.<br><br>Humanity is the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant who have been wiping out colony after colony. You hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol make a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.<br><br>Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.<br><br>Only two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on back-up.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.<br><br>Your life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item than is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.<br><br>One of most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies.  Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.<br><br>Halo also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.

When a cluster is created, the pieces disappear and new ones are added from the top.<br><br>Advanced strategies are required to handle bombs. These count down with every move you make. To clear them from the board, you have to form a cluster with it. When the bomb detonates, the game is over. You gain additional points by including stars, creating chain combos or by forming a cluster with a special pattern. When you manage to surround a single piece with six same-colour pieces, a flower star appears. Flowers stars rotate all pieces around it. If you manage to surround one piece with six flower stars, a black pearl is performed. To win the game in the Marathon mode, you have to create a black pearl combo. There are different final combos possible and the most impressive one requires you to create a flower of black pearls with a black pearl inside.<br><br>The main game modes for Hexic Deluxe and Hexic HD are:<br><br>1. Marathon: unlimited gameplay without time pressure until a black pearl combo is formed or a bomb detonates.<br><br>2. Timed: get as many points as you can before time runs out. Forming clusters provides a time bonus and star flowers reset or expand the time.<br><br>3. Survival: 50 levels where you need to score as many points as possible. Cleared pieces are not replaced by new ones and the remaining ones are locked into the board for the next round. These locked pieces can no longer be moved, but you can remove them by creating clusters with star pieces. The game ends when the entire board is filled with locked pieces.

It is the sequel to Hydro Thunder from more than ten years earlier and although it is done by a different development team, it pursues the same arcade-like gameplay with a cheesy announcer. There is no premise; players race on eight tracks filled with hazards, breakable objects, shortcuts, jumps, tunnels, and events such as police boat chases or a giant sea monster rising from the depths.<br><br>There are no weapons and the effect of the hull from the first game that allowed the player to smash other boats out of the way, has been removed; collisions only slow the boats down and they cannot take damage except when hitting explosive barrels (instant death and respawn). Instead there is a slipstream drafting system where boats in pursuit can gain speed by following the tracks of opponents in front. Additional depth is provided through a boost system. Different types of boost power-ups provide additional speed and they can be combined for even more speed. Enabling boost takes a few seconds after picking up an item, as the engines need to be transformed. While boost is equipped it is possible to jump to reach higher areas.<br><br>In the main racing mode players race fifteen opponents. Good results are rewarded with trophies, and credits used to unlock new boats and races. Certain items such as boat skins can only be unlocked by completing specific tasks in a race. Boats are divided into three classes (Novice, Pro, Expert) with different handling, acceleration and speed. The game's difficulty adapts along with the chosen boat class. The individual boats also have different characteristics. Flat-bottomed ones slide more easily through corners, multi-hulled boats have better grip and V-hulls balance power and control.<br><br>The other game modes are Championship (a series of racing events), Ring Master (time trial races through gates that provide boost) and Gauntlet (time trial through an environment filled with explosive barrels). Multiplayer is supported locally (split-screen) for up four players, and online for up to eight players. Next to the main Race mode, there is a multiplayer mode called Rubber Ducky. Players are divided into two teams and each team has a player controlling a rubber ducky. The goals is to get the team's rubber duck across the finish line ahead of the other team's duck.<br><br>The game also contains 80 hidden packages. These are spinning Hydro Thunder logos and there are ten to be found on each track, often at hard to reach places. Collecting all of them in a single level unlocks a special.

Description=Ryan Lennox is technically dead but still he remains on earth and works for the heavenly organization EtherLight. But also Ryan does a pretty good job, his boss doesn't approve of his not-so-heavenly-methods. So he fires him and puts an assassin on his tail. After the failed murder-attempt, Lennox gets hired by Lazarus, boss of the Abyss - the natural enemy of EtherLight. EtherLight had killed all of his agents and now prepares the final blow to get rid of Abyss once and for all. Ryan now, under the guidance of Black, needs to prevent this from happening.<br><br>Black gives Ryan for that task a few powers like teleportation, telekinesis or a way to make his shots more powerful. But those actions require mana and since Lennox is now a creature of the dark and evil, he needs either to stay in the shadows or convict sins (like killing the EtherLight agents) in order for his mana to regenerate. If he comes near holy places like churches or rooms full of light, his mana decreases and he can only rely on his conventional weapons which range from pistols over machine guns to a full-grown rocket launcher. To get ammunition, security cards or to replenish his life-energy, Ryan has to suck out the remains of the enemies he just killed for those things.

Now the trail of this Dr. Chaos gets warm again as he resurfaces bent on continuing his criminal ways. As a sole agent of Interpol you must travel the globe and search for clues and finally bring this madman to justice.<br><br>Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos is for the most part a typical hidden object game. As is typical of this genre you must identify the listed objects in a photo-illustration. Few variations on the hidden object game-play conventions being level-end-puzzles where you must complete such tasks as identify differences between two photographs or simply finding the mistakes in one single photo to complete the level. If however you get stuck with a specific item and can't move to the next city there's a handy hint feature that will highlight any item you want from the list. The one other large thing that makes this game different is the almost completely immersive interface. From your icons to the world maps to the menu screens, the entire game is production designed to convey a sense of using Interpol computers and equipment to solve the puzzles.<br><br>Each level is typically split into three stages and each level is themed after a world famous city. For example if your search takes you to New York, you can expect to scour The Statue of Liberty, Radio City Music Hall or The Brooklyn Bridge for clues.  Other cities you can expect to explore include Paris, Moscow, Tokyo, Hollywood, London and more.

Description=Invincible Tiger is a side-scrolling fighting game designed to look like a 70's Kung-fu movie. The game area is rather confined however, as it looks more of a movie stage set where Han Tao can only move left or right for a limited distance. The area consists of different levels. Certain objects are highlighted in red and with a press of the button Han Tao can interact with them, climbing up pillars and trees, kicking a bucket towards an enemy or swinging from a branch. The 15 settings include locations such as ships, houses and dojo's. Fighting is done with two buttons to kick and punch, and combining them forms combos. Holding the left stick lowers the height of the attacks. The right stick is used to evade attacks, by dodging and rolling, which is especially useful when enemies approach from both sides. When Han Tao dodges too much, he becomes dizzy and needs to rest for a short while. Next to the environmental attacks there are also different weapons such as swords that can be picked up.<br><br>There is a Ying Yang meter at the top of the screen that is balanced by landing attacks (white) or blocking attacks or taking damage (black). They can be refilled by collecting health (Evil Souls) or meditating, a short period where Han Tao is vulnerable to attacks. Once the levels are high enough a Hyperstate mode can be activated where he moves faster and attacks become more powerful. Certain enemies are shown as marked men, identified by masks floating over their heads. Defeating them before they disappear provides Han Tao with his souls, which re-charges his health automatically, and up to five can be collected at a single time. Souls can also be dropped in front of an idol. When three are collected that way, a form of supernatural energy is unleashed. The game also contain five bosses that require a more tactical approach to defeat them.<br><br>Multiplayer supports a co-operative mode for two players, both locally and online. Each player has a separate health bar, but the lives and Ying Yang meter is shared. When one player is low on health, he will automatically attract the attention of enemies who try to target that player first. In singleplayer there is a main Story mode, along with Time Trial, and Endurance (an endless wave of enemies). <br><br>The game supports different 3D modes. The first one is an Anaglyph 3D mode based on the red/cyan glasses to provide a 3D effect. The second mode is called Digital 3D and can only be used with TVs natively compatible with 3D. This mode can also be user with a number of 3D computer monitors, through HDMI output.

Description=Ion Assault is a twinstick shooter with a space ship, set in enclosed arenas in space similar to Geometry Wars. The left stick is used for movement and the right one for aiming, shown through a red laser. The goal is to survive waves of enemies and space debris (mainly rocks, splitting up into smaller elements similar to Asteroids), but there is a twist to it. Rather than shooting directly, the ship can activate a mass reactor, slightly slowing down movement, but it enables the ship to gather a large mass of ions floating in the arena and concentrate it around the ship. These can then be fired in the desired direction and the amount determines the damage. These ions ricochet off walls and can therefore target multiple enemies, or be caught, before they spread out in the playfield again. There are no other basic means of attack, so the "bullets" are all around the field to be gathered and recycled again.<br><br>There are four main levels that consist of five stages each, along with a boss fight. Destroyed ships leave behind score orbs that can be collected. Certain ships carry power-ups, divided in an active and passive category. Gravity power-ups for instance extend the range of the mass reactor, while a shield temporarily guards the ship against enemy attacks. The campaign can be played in a cooperative mode and there is also versus multiplayer. Gameplay is entirely different in the latter, as the player needs to call on friendly ships to target the opponents, and vice versa.

Compared to games like the Baldur's Gate saga or Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire has simpler gameplay. The combat is in real time. You have direct control only over your main character, although other characters join your party, fighting on your side. You gain experience points from battles, which you can use to increase your abilities and to specialize in one of the three combat styles: unarmed combat, combat with weapons (which require Focus points), as well as various techniques based on your Chi energy (magic). Like other classic Bioware RPGs, there are plenty of conversations with branching dialogue options. On many occasions you'll be forced to make a decision, choosing between two ideologies: "Way of the open palm" (the "good" one) and "way of the closed fist" (the "evil" one).

Instead the player takes on the role of Lance Corporal Ryder, a signal-specialist who is send to the distant moon Pandora. But Ryder isn't just any other soldier. Instead he or she is one of the selected group of people that take part in the so-called Avatar-program. Avatars are a hybrid of Na'vi DNA and human DNA that have been created in order to better interact with the inhabitants of the planet: the Na'vi, tribe-like and technology-wise not very advanced people that are one with nature. Although the Na'vi are friendly to the new-comers at first, soon the humans want more than just diplomatic relations. They want to relocate the Na'vi in order to be able to strip the planet of its natural resources. A war breaks out which only one side can win - it is up to the player which it will be.<br><br>Early in the game the player has to decide weather he wants to help the Na'vi unlock the power of the Well of Souls or if he wants to stay with the humans. Depending on his choice, the gameplay changes significantly:<br><br>1. Human: As a human the player can enter buildings, drive vehicles like buggies and helicopters and use full-body armor as well as several different kinds of firearms including shotguns and flamethrowers. In addition Pandora itself is against him meaning both plants and animals will attack the player but will also grant experience points. As a human the player can build pods that replenish ammo and health a specific locations.<br><br>Na'vi: The Na'vi are more than two meters high and as such can neither enter buildings nor use humans vehicles. But Pandora herself is friendly so plants and animals won't attack (or give experience points for that matter) allowing the player to ride strange horses or fly around on huge dinosaur-like creatures. While the player himself is able to use a machine gun, normally the Na'vi rely on bows and arrows as well as strange swords and staves. If the player manages to pull of a five-hit-combo, a special attack comes available. Na'vi harvest plants in order to get arrows and cell samples.<br><br>Both characters have in common, that they are controlled in a standard 3rd-person-shooter-fashion and have to collect DNA/cell samples. Once enough have been collected, the player gains the ability to get right back into the fight after his hit-points reach zero. Only if not enough samples have been collected will the player re-spawn at the nearest outpost. Also both parties earn experience points for completing quests and killing enemies. Once enough points have been collected, the character levels up and get's access to new weapons and spells allowing him to make himself invisible for example.<br><br>Pandora is divided into several sectors and each sector features several challenges like lifting 100% of the fog of war or collecting a certain amount of cell samples. Fulfilling these objectives grants additional experience points. To further help the player in his quest, a world-domination-mini-game is available at each transporter. This mini-game is turn-based and has the player starting out with only one sector and the goal of conquering all the other. Doing so will grant his character additional experience points, increase his weapons strength and such. Money for building bases and ordering troops on the other hand is earned by playing through the normal campaign. To conquer enemy sectors, three types of units are available that can only be build at a base. Combat is a simple numbers game and plays out automatically. To defend conquered sectors, a defense building for each type of unit can be build.<br><br>The game offers five team-based multiplayer-modes: King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch, Capture and Hold (capture control points in order to make the enemies team loose victory points) and Final Fight where the RDA has to protect three missiles in their base while the Na'vi have to destroy them.

However, you have the opportunity to skip a level, if it is to difficult, but you loose one life (out of five) when you do so.<br><br>Your job in a level is to do exactly what the ancient script tells you, "Align the relics you can see, across or down in groups of three. Turn all squares to solid gold, the path to riches will soon unfold.".<br><br>So, for example, at the start of level 1-1 (first level in the first group), you have a 7x7 playfield, each block is filled with one of four different items (relics). Now you have to exchange adjacent items so, that a line of three or up to five items will be created (more than five are possible, but you can't do this manually). You cannot exchange items when no full line is possible, so creating a line from scratch is not possible. Those items will vanish and the ground will change from beige to gold, the spaces will fill with the items from above, and new items are falling in from the top of the playfield. Once all blocks are gold, you have completed the level. When the time runs out, you have lost a life.<br><br>While the level progress, you will have either bigger playfields or more complex ones. Complex means that they are not always in square or rectangle form, but, for example, they can also have a zigzag side, where either horizontal or vertical alignments aren't possible.

Description=A new triad gang called the Golden Kane is gaining strength in Hong Kong and starts to openly threaten the Dragon Claw with it's leader James Wong, the oldest and most powerful clan. His daughter Billie Wong once had a relationship with a cop and got pregnant with Teko. One day both get kidnapped by the Zakarov Syndicate. The name of the cop which got Billie pregnant is Inspector Tequila. He is a veteran Hong Kong cop which doesn't really work by the book but has his heart in the right place. When a cop gets kidnapped (and killed) by the Golden Kane, Tequila starts investigating against the orders of Captain Ed Lee.<br><br>You take on the role of Tequila and not only get the copkillers but also unwillingly help the Dragon Claw because of Billie and her daughter. But the task isn't an easy one since hundreds of enemies stand between him and his goal which mostly end in killing a boss or blow stuff up.<br><br>To deal with all those bad guys Tequila has not only his fists and his trusty Enforcer (dual wield pistols) but also gets access to machine guns, shotguns, grenades and rocket launchers. But this won't be enough either. To give Tequila the ultimate advantage he also has access to Tequila Time and Tequila Bomb.<br><br>Tequila Time is like the Bullet Time in Max Payne. It slows down time and allows Tequila to better react to the situation. You can either activate it manually or it gets activated automatically if you perform a jump or interact with your environment. You can slide over tables, role around on carts, run up stairrails and kick over tables to use as cover.<br><br>The Tequila Bomb are super moves like a Health Boost or a Spin Attack (white doves included). To fill up your Tequila Bomb Gauge, you either need to find hidden Origami Cranes or earn Style Points.<br><br>You gain Style Points if you kill your enemies during a Tequila Time move or by using your surroundings. If you are fast enough you gain Style Combos which not only fill up your Tequila Bomb Gauge faster but also multiply your Style Points. These Style Points can then be used to unlock all sorts of concept art from the main menu.<br><br>Since John Woo greatly influenced the development, you also take part in Mexican Standoffs. In these you are surrounded by some enemies and Tequila takes them on one by one but he can only lean to left and right to dodge the incoming bullets.<br><br>The game also features an online multiplayer mode with statistics. The two available game modes are Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch for up to 6 players.

Description=Rico Rodriguez is back! After liberating the small Island of San Esperito, the CIA-agent is on his way to the island paradise Panau to find a former colleague: Agent Tom Sheldon. During an undercover-investigation, he vanishes and with him two million dollars. Money, the Agency desperately wants back, especially as they believe that Tom changed sides. So Rico has to infiltrate the criminal organisations of Panau as Scorpio to flush out Tom Sheldon and bring him to justice while plunging the country into chaos - but that's more of a bonus than a real objective...<br><br>Like its predecessor Just Cause, the game drops the player on a huge island. From the start, the whole island is open to be explored by the player in a third-person-shooter-fashion either on foot, by using several dozen different cars or even by using heavily armed helicopters and fast planes. The player is totally free to do what he wants, although that mostly breaks down to reeking havoc and causing chaos by destroying statues, fuel tanks and other military-owned stuff. This way the player earns points which in turn progresses the story, unlocks missions and gives him access to additional stuff from the black market. In addition all over the island crates are hidden containing both money and upgrade parts. Once the black market helicopter has been called via a beacon, the player can order weapons, vehicles and even request a transfer to another location on the island for free. Weapons and vehicles on the other hand cost money and are dropped right on the spot where Rico called. They can also be improved using the upgrade parts the player collected.<br><br>In addition to his weapons, Rico's two most useful tools are his parachute and his grappling hook. The parachute can be activated at almost anytime, even if the player is driving at high speed along the road, and is very useful to make combo-stunts. And this is where the grappling hook comes in: with it, the player can either pull enemies towards him, or pull himself towards a target - which can either be a house two streets away, or a moving car. The latter allows for example high-speed-car-jacks which in some cases result in one of the two types of simple Quick-Time-Events in the game. The other type pops up when Rico tries to unlock a gate or disarm a bomb or such. Although the grappling hock was already featured in the first game, this time around it's a dual-hook. If the player has hit something with his hook, he can put the other end on another object - again no matter if it's a solid or moving object or a random human who had the bad luck of being nearby. This allows the player for example to hook a car to a helicopter, fly over an enemy base and drop the car onto the poor soldiers.<br><br>To keep the action focused even outside the main storyline, challenges like checkpoint-races and optional missions are scattered around the map and each settlement on the island can be cleared 100% by destroying all worthy targets and collecting all crates in the vicinity.

He does so by collecting color spheres, which slowly brings color to the monochromatic background and objects of each level, and jumping on top of monochromatic "enemies" to return them to color and render them harmless. Each level ends when Tint has collected one out of three "pigments" which he must traverse the level to find.<br><br>The game consists of 12 levels over-viewed by a world map.

The setting is moved to Shanghai, where Lynch has moved to and has set up an arms deal with a British crime boss that will help him retire once and for all. Although Kane is there to help him out, the deal goes bad. The game takes place in the ensuing 48 hours.<br><br>As in the predecessor, gameplay revolves around cover-based combat, which is now activated manually with a button, as opposed to the automatic 'sticky' method used before. The player now also has the ability to grab human shields and use them as portable cover. In addition to this, there is a new throwing mechanism to hurl things at people. As such it is possible to throw things like gas canisters in clusters of enemies, which can then be shot and detonated. Last but not least, the player can carry two weapons at once.<br><br>The campaign can be played through in co-op mode with a friend on split-screen, or on dedicated servers; the second player assumes the role of ex-military man Kane. In addition to co-op, several other multiplayer modes are also supported. Fragile Alliance makes a return from the first game and allows a team of four to eight players to perform bank robberies, which consist of taking out the guards, breaking into the vault and making a getaway. Score is based on how much money the player personally gets away with, creating a recipe for betrayal. The Undercover Cop mode is a variation on the previous mode, in which one of the robbers is actually an undercover cop who must prevent the robbers getting away with the loot. The undercover player cannot be harmed by the security personnel, and cannot kill them either. The final mode is Cops and Robbers, which has two teams pitted up against each other, one taking the role of cops, the other taking the role of the robbers. The robbers should attempt to get the money and the cops should attempt to stop them. At the end of each round, the teams will swap places, and whichever team gets away with the most money wins.

Description=Kinect Adventures is the main launch game for Microsoft's Kinect peripheral as it comes packed in with the Kinect device, much like Wii Sports for the Nintendo Wii.<br><br>The game offers five main mini-game challenges, largely geared towards showing off the device with casual, family-oriented gameplay. It requires the peripheral to play with online gameplay and local games for up to two players, head-to-head or cooperatively. Online players can be friends or random players found online.<br><br>Each game is essentially played by copying movement of the players and translating it onscreen through their Xbox 360 Avatars, through movement of the body and limbs, including crouching, jumping and movement in a 3-D space. It also incorporates voice chat features where the player can voice unlocked characters and an option allows Kinect to snap pictures of the player during gameplay (shown through an icon of a camera). These pictures are stored locally, but there is also a sharing function through the website KinectShare.com. Each game also features points earned through beating time challenges and collecting emblems, with various medals awarded depending on player performance.<br><br>There are four main adventure modes and the player needs to score at least a bronze medal in each challenge to progress. Next to the main adventure mode there is a Free Play and Timed game mode. The mini-games in Kinect Adventures are:<br><br>1. The 20,000 Leaks<br>Players are trapped in a glass case under water. Fish, being the evil beings that they are, constantly attack the case which causes water to pour in. The player is then forced to use every available appendage to block off the incoming streams of water. Actual risk of drowning not included.<br><br>River Rush<br>Here, players must move their bodies left and right and physically jump to steer and launch a raft down a river. Includes the ability to ride along clouds and alternate paths in the air through trees.<br><br>Rallyball<br>Think of it like a 3D full-body version of the classic title Breakout. Smash balls to break blocks at the end of a hallway. Except unlike Breakout, players will likely not end the session panting and sweating.<br><br>Reflex Ridge<br>Players ride on a platform something like a flatbed on a minecart track. Here, they must duck, jump, lean, and generally dodge hurdles and obstacles while collecting the "A" emblems with an emphasis on split-screen competition.<br><br>Space Pop<br>This game tracks movement in 3D space, not just flailing around in one spot, but moving towards and away from the television. Players must pop transparent balls (or bubbles?) as they move between holes among the room in which the player's avatar is standing. Players can also "fly" a bit by flapping their arms, hover by extending them, and fall down by putting them vertically along the body.

Description=Kinectimals is one of the launch titles for Microsoft's hands-free controller, the Kinect sensor. The game falls in line a bit with Nintendo's Nintendogs titles about playing with and taking care of virtual pets. Except here, petting the animal has moved from swiping a stylus across a small screen to physically petting the animal with your hands using the Kinect camera.<br><br>The game features thirty different cubs that can be raised, trained, and played with. It also features light story elements focused on pirate treasure with various mysteries to solve on and about the island, Lemuria, on which the game takes place. A small flying character known as Bumble introduces the player to the game and various other elements, such as guidance on the story part of the game. Initially five cubs are available (Cheetah, Royal Bengal Tiger, Black Panther, African Lion and African Leopard), but later on six additional ones can be unlocked (Bornean Clouded Leopard, Serval, White Jaguar, Bobcat, Siberian Tiger and Saber-tooth Tiger). Additional ones can be added to the game through downloadable content and toy animals that come with scan codes that can be held up to the camera to redeem them. These are tied through game shops and a deal with Burger King for instance.<br><br>Besides simply raising and petting a virtual cat, the player can also take part in mini-games with pets, as well as teaching them tricks. Mini-games involve some abstract ideas for a virtual pet, such as jumping rope and driving the pet around on a remote control car. Aside from the story elements, the game is very open-ended allowing players to experience the game, generally, however they want.

Description=Kinect Sports is one of the launch games for Microsoft's Kinect peripheral for the Xbox 360 where movement of the players using their body and limbs, not a physical controller, is translated onscreen through their Xbox 360 Avatars. All included games are simulations of real-life sports. There are three main game modes: a main event for one or two players locally or over Xbox Live, Party Play for multiple players in a single room, and Mini-Games where the included sports are presented with a variation in the gameplay. Not all games share the same free-for-all or cooperative options. For AI opponents the player can also determine the difficulty level. Party Play consists of variations of the main sports as well, for up to six players divided over two teams. A session generally lasts fifteen minutes with six rounds. A game is chosen by turning a wheel and then each team has to appoint a player to compete.<br><br>The included sports are:<br><br>1. Beach Volleyball<br>Teams of two characters play games of beach volleyball in a race to reach seven points first, but only when there is a two-point difference. There are different serving options and the player can also jump and hit to smash or block. Extending an arm left or right in the direction of the team player is done to pass, build up an attack or return a ball. Passing can also be done with two hands for more accuracy and the game registers a small touch to land the ball close over the net. In the first mini-game you return balls on a field filled with distractions and in the second game you can only return the ball with a specific body part, highlighted on the screen. You have to return the ball with your head, feet or hands as indicated.<br><br>2. Bowling<br>Players extend a hand left or right to pick up a ball and then swing it backwards and immediately forwards, releasing it on the lane. By stepping around and leaning in you can give the ball more momentum. Effect can be applied by crossing your arm over your chest after swinging. In the mini-games there is a survival mode where you need to hit all pins in a single throw, with different positions for each challenge. You can miss five times before the game is over. In the second mini-game you need to hit as many racks of pins as possible against a time limit, quickly picking up balls left or right. A new rack only appear when all pins have been thrown over.<br><br>3. Boxing<br>A boxing match is done from a see-through first-person perspective. Players can hit and block high and low and the game registers the strength of the punch. A game is won through a regular knockout, a technical knockout or a judges' decision. When you are knocked down yourself, you need to hit the stars circling above your head to get back up before the count reaches 10. Throwing punches wildly is discouraged as multiple blocks allow an opponent to counter with a hard strike.<br><br>4. Football<br>In this game of soccer players need to reach the opponent's goal through passes. When the ball is in possession different passing options are shown. The pass is given by kicking in one of the available directions, while the opponent can intercept by blocking the path or tackling. When close to the goal you can shoot. In a defending position you attempt to stand in the ball's path or perform a tackle. As the keeper you can sidestep and use your hands, feet or body to block the incoming shot. There is no free movement otherwise. The referee can award penalties and free kicks and calls a fault when the player takes too long to pass. Using a corner, a throw-in or a cross-pass into the center a style shot can sometimes be performed. There is a cooperative mode to play with another local player in your team taking turns whenever an action is performed. The two mini-games involve blocking many consecutive shots as a keeper or switching places and doing target shooting with a keeper in the goal. <br><br>5. Table tennis<br>Games of table tennis are played as singles or doubles. The first to reach eleven points wins, but only when there is a two-point difference. To serve players pick up the ball, throw it in the air and hit it. Returning the ball is done by extending the arm and swinging left or right. The strength and the direction of the shot is picked up. Effect can be applied by raising your arm up and down while returning to introduce topspin or backspin. In the first mini-game you have to return a constant stream of balls quickly and the second one is a rally that goes on until you miss.<br><br>6. Track and field<br>This event consists of multiple sports: Hurdles, Sprint, Javelin, Discus Throw and Long Jump. Each one is played using the motions you would perform in real-life. For instance while doing hurdles you need to actually run at a fixed position to gain speed and jump whenever you approach a hurdle. All of the events can be played one after another as a pentathlon. In the two running events there is a technique to gain extra boost while running.<br><br>The game incorporates the Show Off & Share functionality of Kinect Adventures. There is an option to allow Kinect to record video highlights of yourself while playing the game. These are shown when an event is finished. They can be shared locally or posted online to kinectshare.com - where it is possible to download the video to a PC or share them directly through Facebook.<br><br>In the singleplayer mode the player earns experience by competing in events. Certain amounts of points are rewarded with badges and avatar items.

Description=Lazy Raiders is a platformer about an extremely lazy explorer. His quest is to retrieve sixteen lost relics sealed in sixteen treasure rooms, but he refuses to move. Instead the player needs to use the left stick to rotate the game world, and that way move anything that is not fastened, causing the explorer to move left, right, up or down until steady ground is found. The A button rotates the area 180 degrees straight away. Almost nothing moves by itself, the player needs to make gravity do the trick. Most areas are built as mazes and the player can quickly adjust the rotation to move in different directions quickly, avoiding hazards and enemies, as the explorer has no means of defence.<br><br>While exploring cash can be gathered by collecting gems and clearing traps. When a sufficient amount of cash is gathered, the location of an idol is revealed and these need to be collected to unlock the treasure rooms. To exit an area a pick needs to be found and when it is located quickly enough (shining as a golden pick) a time bonus is provided. Areas become progressively difficult and quickly require more timing, with the explorer moving past switches to open temporary gates. Certain passages are guarded by fire traps and flips generally disable them. Causing a box of a TNT to collide with a trap disables it permanently and for almost every trap there is a countermeasure. Rotation can also affect minions, for instance causing a bat to roll into a ball when the maze is turned around.<br><br>Players can investigate an area first by zooming in and out to locate the difficulties. Later levels also introduce fellow thieves who snatch the gems. They can hurt the explorer and need to be taken out by driving them into traps. Other hazards include rolling boulders, spikes, moving walls, icicles, giant snowballs, clockwork blades and rolling platforms. In the later levels there are also minor puzzles where mechanisms need to be activated by dropping gears of the correct colour in place. The explorer can pick up lucky coins for a temporary health boost or to double all rewards.

Description=Leave Home is an abstract space shooter with a game session of a fixed length. The challenge is in scoring as many points as possible within the provided amount of time. In addition it includes dynamic difficulty. Based on the player's performance more or less enemies appear (with the bonus of scoring more points when there are more on the screen), the environment is changed and randomized, and the gameplay becomes much harder or easier. It is meant to be played in consecutive sessions to attack the best scores. The player's ship can explode an unlimited amount of times, but death drains an Anger Meter on the screen and it takes a few seconds to respawn.<br><br>The player's ship generally travels at a steady pace from left to right and it is able to move into any part of the screen. At certain moments however the entire environment is distorted and different types of manoeuvres are needed. The ship can fire an unlimited amount of bullets and defeated enemies leave behind blue chips, which provide points. The ship's special ability is to perform a Split Shot. By keeping that key or button pressed, the firing pattern slowly moves back to land at 180 degrees backwards. By tapping the key it is also possible to keep the shot fixed at an in-between angle. The ship, the environment and the enemies are all presented as shapes with bright colours and a lot of blur applied.<br><br>At the end of the game session a graphic of the anger meter is drawn. The game also contains a number of challenges and unlockable options such as a Turbo mode, five test stages and Full difficulty.

Description=In Left 4 Dead, four humans, Francis, Zoey, Bill, and Louis, had the bad luck to land in the middle of a zombie invested zone, are now trying to get to the evacuation point, and survive the apocalyptic pandemic. The game contains several scenarios which are all divided into several chapters with the goal to reach the save room and hundreds of zombies in-between.<br><br>The doors to the save rooms can't be opened by the infected once closed and they contain weapons (shotguns, sub-machine guns, etc.), medipacks, and ammo for the survivors to restock before the next part of the journey. The door of the save room can also be never opened again by the survivors once it's closed so the team needs to stay together or otherwise they will have to decide whether they leave a friend behind or fight a hopeless battle at the save room door.<br><br>If a survivor is too badly damaged, the character goes down but is neither dead immediately nor defenseless. The character still can shoot with a pistol at incoming zombies to make it easier for teammates to help the character up. This is especially important when one of the special zombies such as the Hunter, who can jump great distances and immediately downs his target, has a survivor in his grasp. If the zombie isn't killed in time, the teammate will be dead.<br><br>Other special zombies include the Tank, which is a huge mutated zombie that can take a few hundred bullets before it goes down and does a serious punch as well as the boomer which vomits on a survivor and immediately attracts dozens of new zombies. This also happens if a car burglar alarm goes of or something similar disturbs the night.<br><br>While the campaigns can be played either with AI controlled teammates or with other human players in co-op, the multiplayer also features an additional game mode called "Versus". The basic premise remains the same with four players needing to get safely to the save room but at the same time four other players are randomly assigned the roles of one of the special zombies with the obvious goal to help the normal, AI-controlled infected to get rid of the survivors. The zombie players have the advantage that they can spawn almost anywhere on the map if it's out of sight the survivors and see them through walls if they make a noise but are otherwise, except for the tank, easy to take down if noticed early.

Description=Left 4 Dead 2 takes place one week after the events of the first game and three weeks after the first infection. Instead of following the journey of Zoey, Francis, Louis and Bill from the first game, the player gets to control Coach, Rochelle, Nick or Ellis. They arrived a few minutes too late at the evacuation point and now need to fight their way through the south-eastern part of infected America to the next official evacuation point.<br><br>The core gameplay has not changed since Left 4 Dead. The player still looks through the eyes of one of the survivors and fights his way together with his three team mates through hordes and hordes of zombies. Instead of fighting mainly in the dark, most content of the five campaigns takes place both out in the open and in daylight. This also plays into the hands of a new feature: weather effects. The second part of the third campaign is even completely build around the theme of a heavy storm hitting a small town on the outskirts.<br><br>Heavy rain is not the only new enemy for the survivors. The zombie horde also grew through the addition of three new special infected called Charger (a smaller version of the tank), Jockey (he jumps onto a team mate and moves him away from the group), Spitter (spits deadly acid in front of the player's feet) and a new class of common infected: the uncommon common infected. They have the same basic attributes as normal zombies but have a special ability. The clown for example attracts a horde of zombies, while the riot police man is immune to damage from the front.<br><br>To take on new and old enemies the weaponry has been greatly expanded. Besides new rifles, pistols and shotguns, melee weapons such a a chainsaw, a guitar and a baseball bat have been introduced to the game. Also new is a laser sight that can be used to increase the accuracy of a weapon as well as two types of special ammunition. In addition the Boomer Bile is now available to launch at enemies and turn the raging horde against them.<br><br>Multiplayer once again consists of several different modes. Besides playing through the campaigns cooperatively and playing both the survivors and special infected in the Versus mode, the players can play choose the Survival, Scavenge and Realism Mode. Survival pits the players against wave after wave of enemies with the only goal being to survive as long as possible. Scavenge requires the players to collect fuel canisters to fill up a generator while the other team, playing as special infected, tries to stop them. Realism Mode is a variation of coop-play for hardcore zombieslayers. The stakes are much higher there. The zombies can only be killed with a headshot, the witch has changed into a one-hit-one-kill-weapon, and a downed player is dead unless he is revived with the shock paddles.

Description=Legend tells that Pandora's box released all the evils of mankind when it was opened. But in reality the box actually is a weapon of ultimate strength that decimated societies and crushed civilizations until the Council of 98, a secret order, took the relic and its secret and hid it from world. They hid it so good in fact, that over time the knowledge was lost even to them and so the world was safe from the box's destruction. At least until a team of archaeologists find the box on the bottom of the ocean, recover it and place it in a museum in New York City.<br><br>The player takes on the role of Charles Deckard, a professional art thief. He has been commissioned by a mysterious man named LeFey to get into the museum and steal the box but instead of stealing it once he is in front of it, he makes the biggest mistake in his life and opens it unleashing horros upon the world which were believed to be only myths. Now Deckard is hunted by a mysterious entity named "The Black Order" and simultaneously has to undo the disaster he created.<br><br>Legendary is a straight forward first-person-shooter. During the course of the game Deckcard finds everything from an axe to molotov cocktails and an advanced assault rifle to fight against the ancient horror and special units of the Black Order. When he opened the box he also gained the ability to see and use the life energy called Animus Vitae. Dropped by the mythical monsters after their death, it not only heals Deckard but can also be used to unleash an energy wave called Animus Pulse which blasts nearby enemies to the ground.<br><br>When the player has enough of all the world-saving, he can start up the multiplayer mode for up to 8 players. The game pits the rebels against the Black Ops but also puts in the mythical, AI-controlled monsters from the single player campaign to grant the players access to Animus Vitae and generally spice things up.

Description=Continuing the tradition of adapting known franchises such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones with visuals based on LEGO, this game takes on the Batman universe. The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth. <br><br>It is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles.<br><br>Both characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode.<br><br>In the second part of the game players take control of the different villains such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush, Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though they can die, they immediately respawn.<br><br>Multi player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions allow drop in/drop out co-op. The PSP release fares worst of all and does not contain any kind of multiplayer option.

Description=LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4 is the first installment of the Harry Potter series in LEGO form. Spanning the first four years of the Harry Potter franchise, players take control of a wide variety of characters and relive famous moments from the first four books; Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Goblet of Fire. Almost all of the game takes place inside Hogwarts.<br><br>The Story mode is broken up into four years with six chapter per year. When you first play story mode you are required to play as certain characters that are part of that story and you cannot choose any character from the entire series. But once you beat that chapter a Free Mode is unlocked, allowing you to pick any unlocked character and replay that story. All story chapters and years can be accessed in The Leaky Cauldron which acts as the central hub in the game. The entire environment allows for continuous play and most places can be revisited at any time. Many of the characters' interactions change however based on the time of year, or when certain characters are introduced such as the Dementors or Gilderoy Lockhart.<br><br>Outside of The Leaky Cauldron is Diagon Alley. In Diagon Alley you can head to other stores to obtain items and supplies. At Madam Malkin's Robes you can spend all of your hard earned studs (the currency) to buy new characters. At Eeylops Eye Emporium you can head upstairs and buy Red Bricks which contain cheat codes of sorts to use. And at Wiseacre's Wizarding Supplies you can buy fun new spells to cast on anybody you like. Casting spells is an important part of the gameplay and is accessed by a spell wheel in which you can choose many ranging from Wingardium Leviosa to the dreaded Aveda Kedavra (only the three versions of Voldemort can use this).<br><br>LEGO Harry Potter adds to the replay value by having a bunch of collectibles for you to obtain. If you want to get 100% completion you're going to have to do things such as find and purchase all 167 characters, rescue 50 students in peril, find 200 gold bricks, and much more. Hogwarts school is open to you at all time where you can search the many rooms and floors for all these collectibles. You will have to wait though if you try to get everything early because many characters have their own special abilities pertaining to them.<br><br>There is no online multiplayer in LEGO Harry Potter but there is co-op. At any time another person can join you in the action, played on a single screen. Similar to LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues, when one character goes off screen, it is split automatically and the game goes on that way until they are close again.

Description=In LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues the players once again explore the Indiana Jones universe with "LEGO-fied" characters. This time the main part of the game focuses on the events of the fourth film of the series called Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with three campaigns retelling the story in a humorous, light-hearted way similar to the other games from the LEGO series. The other three campaigns on the other hand once again turn their focus on the original three films but with different scenes and levels that can't be found in the first game.<br><br>The game itself is a third-person platform/action game where the players take control over various heroes including Indiana Jones and side-characters which mostly don't have any real name. Again each character has has different abilities, fears and weapons. While Indiana Jones has his whip to pull items out of reach or constrain enemies with, his son Mutt is a very good repairman. The characters also have different phobias (snakes, rats, spiders), each corresponding to their personalities.<br><br>Instead of providing a central hub which the characters return after each mission, this time around not only the story moves forward but also the locations. So while the game starts out at the University campus and uses it as the main hub, it eventually moves over to the dig-site in South America. After each successful mission a new part of the hub is unlocked mostly through unlocking new characters or vehicles that allow the player to get to previously unreachable territory. Since these hubs are very big, a great amount of vehicles is available to unlock the same way other characters are unlocked: finding them in the hub and paying studs for them. Studs are again collected by destroying scenery objects, building stuff and such. To that end each level again holds a great amount of secret for which different characters are needed to unlock them requiring several playthroughs of the same level to find all bonus items and complete the game 100%.<br><br>The game once again features an editor to create unique heroes from parts. In addition a level editor is now available where the player walks around the map spawning the items he needs and putting them in place with his character. The two-player co-op mode also makes his return allowing two players to play through the whole game. The second player can enter the game at any given time by pressing a button on the second controller. As opposed to the previous games, the players aren't restricted to the same area anymore. Instead they now both can move freely around. Once a character leaves the screen of the other, the view gets divided with the placement of each character-view changing all the time depending on which direction the corresponding player is moving in relation to the center of the level.

Description=Larry Lovage, the nephew of Larry Laffer, still lingers in his student home with nothing to do but to watch porn and - well, let's not go there. One day he gets a call from his Uncle who has a problem with a mole inside his famous adult film studio sabotaging productions and creating other problems. Larry (Laffer) asks Larry (Lovage) to come over and help him find the mole while working under the cover of a useless summer intern - a disguise Larry (the Uncle) is sure to be easy to contain by his nephew. Larry (the Nephew) of course immediately jumps at the opportunity to meet famous stars and agrees to the deal arriving at Laffer Studios the next day.<br><br>The player takes over the controls of Larry Lovage and is free to roam the studio area either on foot or by "borrowing" one of the many golf carts available. These can also be used to run over other people but will quickly arise the attention of the police force on site who will try to capture Larry to put him to justice. But driving over peasants isn't the main goal of the game, instead Larry has do to chores for the people on the compound while searching for the mole. These missions range from removing graffiti, delivering packages, collecting items scattered all around an area and other kinds of simple mini-games.<br><br>As opposed to previous Leisure Suit Larry-games Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust doesn't contain nudity or sexual content but still features humor, good-looking women and mature themes including parodies of famous movies and the porn-industry.

Description=Limbo is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer set in a sinister, monochromatic world. The player controls a protagonist simply known as the The Boy, who is said to enter the world Limbo in search of his sister. However, the story as a whole can also be seen as a metaphor for the search for companionship and getting around in a new environment. Not a single clue is given at the start, there are no cut-scenes and the game starts right away. In that world filled with hazards and danger, his means are few and he is extremely vulnerable. Only two buttons are used, a feeble jump and one to perform an action, combined with movement. This allows him to explore the world and hang on ledges, slide down slopes, push objects, pull levers, and cling to ropes, but the player has to make most of what is present in the environment to get by, often with physics-based elements.<br><br>The gloomy world has a dusty filter showing the game through misted glass, and no vivid colours are present. It is divided into 24 chapters that seamlessly flow into each other, only from the level selection in the main menu can be derived where a new chapter starts. The world is rendered in 2D but with different layers of depth in the scenery. It moves from a forest to an abandoned city and eventually an industrial zone. The player faces three kinds of challenges. There are obstacles where The Boy simply needs to find a way to progress, there are dangerous creatures that hunt him down and try to kill them, and finally there is a gang of children who band together to ward off the intruder and set up traps for him, with a touch of Lord of the Flies. Encounters with other humans are however brief and rare. These account for most of the horror moments, of the psychological kind, with other unnerving sequences like when the player is forced to use the corpses of other children as a bridge.<br><br>Music and sound effects are minimal and there are no on-screen elements referring to health or other statistics. Every single misstep, often with gruesome consequences, is fatal. In the same vein the boy cannot jump from great heights or jump very far. When dead, the game immediately reloads before the current puzzle. Most of the encounters are centered around puzzles and these are sometimes based on timing or speed when being chased. Other elements serve only for setting the scene, when The Boy gets to ride a boat to cross a lake (he cannot swim and drowns immediately) or finds the corpses of the people who did not make it in Limbo. Most of the game elements are discovered through experimentation, like the effects of a glowing worm that attaches itself to The Boy's head, changing the flow of gravity, or what happens when a giant spider captures him. There is only a single path through the levels and generally there is only a single solution to a problem.

Description=Lips is a singing game in the vein of Sony's SingStar series of games.  Much like the popular past time of karaoke, players sing along to the lyrics of songs that are displayed on-screen.  The game also judges you based on pitch, earning you points based on how accurately you sang.  At certain points in the game, players are prompted to perform gestures with the microphone (such as tilting it upwards).  When they do this, the bonus 'Star Stream' mode is activated which earns even more points.<br><br>Lips can be played in either Solo, VS, or Co-Op modes.  At any time during solo play, a second player can shake their wireless mike to create a multiplayer game.  VS mode is a battle for the highest score, while Co-Op has players working together to achieve a high score.  If both players trigger Star Stream simultaneously in co-op, their star bonuses are doubled.<br><br>There are also special game modes for those who want to try something different: in Kiss, the on-screen couple gets closer together the better that both players sing.  When they get close enough, you'll be prompted to tilt your mikes up to make them kiss.  Time Bomb lights a bomb's fuse at the start of the song.  By singing well, you'll fill a glass up with water - when there's enough water inside, use it to extinguish the fuse.<br><br>Players who don't want to sing can still participate by using a controller as a Noise Maker.  This allows them to add sound effects such as snapping fingers, cowbells, tambourines and even crowd noise to the song.<br><br>The song list is localized for different countries, with certain tracks only included in the version for specific regions. Below is the main track list that is largely shared across versions. An overview of the localized differences can be found through the related links section.<br><br>1.

Description=Lips: Number One Hits is the second game in the karaoke series and largely continues the ideas from the original Lips title, but with a fresh bunch of tracks. This title solely consists of songs (all master tracks) that have reached a number one position on the global charts. Players have to sing along with lyrics on the screen using a microphone to fill empty bars, along with pitch and timing lines to get it right, while a video plays in the background. Points are awarded based on accuracy. This builds a meter that can be used to unleash a Star Scream. When it's available you tilt the microphone and all lines are filled with stars. You can then fill them with your voice. The points are used for a levelling system along with medals that can be earned. Instead of the original video another type of visualization can be shown as well, and it is possible to reduce the vocals more. The menus have been overhauled, but the in-game mini-games are still identical.<br><br>There are Solo, VS and Co-op modes. While playing a second player can shake the microphone to hop in. The motion controls are also used when your avatar (or a silhouette if you have none) turns up in between verses. They show a motion such as moving their hands in the air or playing a guitar and you have to mimic it. The same has to be done when a tambourine or a maraca appears on the screen. You move the microphone as if you're playing the instrument. Players with a regular controller can still hop in and make noise that adds to the song or distracts other players. Importing custom songs through USB is also still supported.<br><br>Most of the DLC from the original game can be carried over and when a savegame for the original game is detected, the songs can be imported by swapping the disc. After every track the original disc needs to be reinserted however. The game comes bundled with a wireless, motion sensitive microphone and a redemption code to download a five-song pack for free from the Lips store.<br><br>The 40 songs included on the disc are:<br><br>1. 2Pac feat.

Like the original, the player controls a character that has to collect all the gold on the screen and avoid the deadly enemies (the Monks, or the Bungelings from the Apple II original back in the 80's) that chase him. Instead of digging holes, he has a gun to blast parts of the scenery.<br><br>This version brings new gameplay elements, a level editor (which allows for uploading levels on Xbox Live and editing downloaded levels) and online play. The game also contains a timeline of the Lode Runner series. In singleplayer, the classic mode is called Journey, but there is also Hang On with eight levels filled with gold where the amount of enemies gradually increases. The goal is to collect as much gold as possible, and the result is graded as Bronze, Silver, Gold or Diamond.

Description=The Lord of the Rings: Conquest puts the player right in the middle of the most famous battle of the Third Age including the assaults on Helm's Deep and Gondor and the battle at the Black Gate. In two campaigns the player either fights for the forces of good or the forces of evil and leads them to victory.<br><br>Similar to Star Wars: Battlefront, the player can choose from up to four classes and looks him over the shoulder while moving him over the battlefield: The warrior rushes into the crowd and fights his enemy up close and has the ability to unleash powerful combos. The mage is more focused on protecting his friends from incoming fire or healing them but has also access to a shock wave and a powerful lightning strike. The scout on the other hand turns invisible and kills even the most powerful enemy with a small stab in the back or attaches a bomb to an enemy and sends him back to his friends. The last is the Archer who prefers to stay in the back unleashing a rain of fire or poison arrows on the enemy. But each of the classes requires energy to perform the more powerful attacks which is gained by simply killing enemies.<br><br>Besides the usual weaponry a class carries like swords or daggers, the player can also find and use catapults stationed on the battlefield or get on the back of a horse to get the advantage and thin the enemy horde just by sprinting through it.<br><br>After choosing a class, the player is dropped at the first spawn point of the current map and is then required to help his allies to help fulfill different objectives depending on the game mode and map. These can range from capturing and defending positions to killing the enemy hero. While in single player the heroes on both sides are called when needed and fit the current map (like the Gandalf and the Balrog in the Mines of Moria), in multiplayer the best player of one team is automatically chosen once his team has reached a certain percentage of points needed to win.<br><br>The multiplayer mode also allows up to four players to play together through the campaigns and features three additional game modes: In "Conquest", similar to Battlefield 2142, the goal is to capture flag points on the map in a pre-determined order and once all points are held by one team, the game is over. In "Team-Deathmatch" the team with the most kills wins the game and "Find the Ring" is a "Capture the Flag"-variant featuring the one ring instead of a flag.

Description=Lost Planet 2 takes place ten years after the events depicted in Lost Planet: Extreme Condition. Thanks to Wayne's action, the planet E.D.N. III isn't just a world of ice anymore. Many parts have already dried up. Jungles with lush streams of water have grown and dry deserts full of sand popped up. But life on E.D.N. III still isn't easy. The Akrid, although bothered by the heat, are still a very serious threat. And NEVEC is working on a new evil plan while the other factions are engaged in civil war over thermal-energy. While it's no longer necessary to survive the cold, it is still needed to power all the machinery on the plant and as such very valuable.<br><br>The campaign is divided into six episodes, each putting the player into the shoes of a different faction. While at first the episodes don't seem to be connected, it soon comes apparent that it is once again up to the player to save E.D.N. III. But as opposed to the first game, he doesn't roam the levels alone anymore. Instead the campaign is fully focused on a cooperative experience, allowing up to four friends to engage in the fight for the planet. If no humans are available, the player can call up to three bots on his side.<br><br>The basic gameplay remains the same as in the first game, meaning the player take on  both the Akrids and other Humans in a third-person-shooter fashion using different kinds of weapons including machine guns, rocket launchers and different types of grenades, although only two weapons and one type of grenade can be carried at the same time. The available weaponry remains almost the same as in the first game with just a few mostly coop-centric additions like the shield. The player has also once again access to a short-ranged grappling hook which can be used to climb up buildings and walls and such in order to overcome obstacles or gain an advantage over the enemy. In addition Vital Suits, a kind of Mech, make their return in all forms of shapes including a VS in which three characters can ride and shoot at the same time.<br><br>While thermal-energy (T-ENG) isn't required to keep the body warm anymore, it is still very useful to keep the player alive. Through T-ENG, the health-bar is slowly replenished automatically or faster, when the player activates the harmonizer. T-ENG can also be used to open the chest scattered around the map, mostly containing weapons. In addition, the players can trade T-ENG to keep friends alive, even when they are low on health. If the unthinkable happens however, the player looses 500 combat points and respawns at the nearest data-station. These have to be activated through a Quick Time Event and not only dub as spawn-points but also activate the mini-map and are one source for additional combat points. When all combat points are depleted, the game ends and the player has to restart the whole section.<br><br>During the course of the campaign, the player unlocks additional customization options for his multiplayer-character like additional weapons, a different armor or gestures mostly by using credits he finds scattered around the levels. But instead of just buying the stuff, the player has to put his money into the one-armed bandit and hope it stops at the right position. <br><br>Besides the coop-mode, the game also features traditional multiplayer for up to 16 players including modes like deathmatch as well as a practice mode in which the players need to use all their skills to fulfill objectives in the fastest time possible in order to climb up the online leaderboard.

After going to sleep nightmares come as a mix of her sorrow and stories from a adventure-book but also as a way to deal with her feelings.

Instead she just walks almost blindly from left to right on the screen with no regard to the dangers lurking ahead and without ever thinking of stopping or changing her speed.<br><br>The player's goal is to get Sofi safely to the end of the level where a mailbox with a postcard from her grandma awaits. To do so, the player has access to up to six objects including beams, ventilators and slingshots. Placed in front of Sofi, she uses them to get to higher planes or get safely over gabs. But these objects only exist for a short period of time and will perish weather or not Sofi had the chance to use them. In addition the way the objects appear is completely random, making it almost impossible for the player to plan his route through the big levels.

It is used to blow walls away that keep Sofi from moving on and also to kill the various enemies like dragonflies, walking mushrooms and such. Two hits from an enemy and Sofi reappears at the beginning of the level.

Description=Madballs in Babo: Invasion is a game based on a toy-line of rubber balls of the same name, originally started in the mid-1980s and revived at the end of 2007. It is a mostly top-down shooter where the player controls one of these armed balls in a series of maze-like levels with slightly different paths leading to the same level goal.<br><br>It is set on the planet Babolon where balls of rock and goo evolved quickly into intelligent beings when the planet was hit by a streak of green light. The race was quickly divided into two factions, B*D*I and Scorched, both in search for the artifact that crashed on the planet, while a third faction was already trying to solve the mystery as well.<br><br>The singleplayer portion consists of a Campaign mode, Level Attack and Boot Camp (training). In the main mode players choose one of the two available factions to play an identical set of levels. Each faction also consists of five different classes based on health, speed, certain resistances and weaknesses, and specific abilities. The available classes are Assault, Heavy, Support, Flyer and Runner. They need to be unlocked gradually and it is encouraged to replay levels as certain functions and weapons only become available after a while.<br><br>The ball needs to traverse the levels, take out enemies with ranged weapons such as lasers or grenades and collect items, health, and solve small puzzles. Often there is an option to change the weapon, access terminals for additional information, or change the main character to a different class using a transmogrifier. All weapons generally have two shooting options and other special abilities (a spinning attack, bursts of speed) are tied to specific classes and factions. In later levels, the balls meet opponents with specific weaknesses that need to be taken advantage of using the appropriate weapon.<br><br>Even though most areas are maze-like and cramped, there are many different ways to approach them, using bridges, hidden passageways and jump pads. The gameplay is mostly action-based, but there are also some minor puzzle elements; often a number of glowing levels need to be touched to open up forcefields.<br><br>The multiplayer potion of the game offers online co-op with up to four players for individual levels or an Endure mode for the entire campaign, and regular match-ups with 21 maps and up to sixteen players.

Description=A different take on EA's Madden games of realistic baseball simulation, Madden NFL Arcade focuses more on looser arcade-oriented gameplay, similar to Midway's Blitz games. It features all 32 NFL teams including top stars with a five-on-five match up, offense consists of an Offensive Lineman, a Quarterback and three receivers while defense consists of a Defensive Lineman and four backfield defenders.  Unlike other Madden games there is no time limit, instead the play ends with a set score (the default being 30) with a shortened field consisting of 60 yards with the beginning team starting on their own 20 yard line.  The offense has four tries in order to make a touchdown, however, after those four plays if the offense is not successful, it will be automatically ruled a turnover and defense will receive the ball. There are no field goals, punts or first downs.<br><br>In order to aid the player there are 13 different power-ups, including the ability to freeze a player on the field, slow or speed up gameplay, throw three footballs at once with only one going to the intended receiver, a power-up that will add an extra down, as well as a power-up that will switch the score of the game.  The player receives these at random times during the match, similar to a slot machine. When players receive a power-up they can store it and activate it at a chosen moment. There are options to play against the computer A.I. or with four friends, either two friends head-to-head or two friends teaming against a second team of friends. Online multiplayer is also supported, with the option to define custom rules along with the ability to use the power-ups available in offline play and update-able rosters to reflect current NFL rosters.

Description=Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.<br><br>Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball. <br>Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.<br><br>The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.

Traveling across the galaxy, Durandral finds the home world of the S'pht, a Pfhor slave race, who Durandal liberates and who now worship Durandral as their Messiah. Durandal is searching for the location of a legendary lost tribe of S'pht who may hold the key to his mad quest for... well, whatever he's madly questing for. Unfortunately, the Pfhor dislike Durandral's presence and begin attacking his army. <br><br>Marathon 2: Durandal is the sequel to the first Marathon. Although the engine is similar to Doom in most respects (2.5D maps, bitmap sprites instead of polygons, etc.), Marathon 2 distinguishes itself with such features such as: a rudimentary inventory system, ambient sound, multiple fire modes for each weapon, allies who aid the player, enemies belonging to different factions which will attack each other, a more developed plot (gradually narrated to the player at various computer terminals scattered throughout the levels (much like System Shock's e-mail transmissions)).<br><br>The game's engine has gained a number of improvements over the original Marathon.

All liquids use oxygen when the player is submerged and some also do damage.  Many levels have mechanisms allowing  areas to be flooded or drained, changing the depth of the liquid.<br><br>The other major new feature is a bunch of new multiplayer modes.  The entire single-player portion can be played cooperatively with up to eight players and the game adjusts weapon and monster placement accordingly.  In addition to "Every Man for Himself" mode (essentially deathmatch), it now includes "Kill of the Hill" where the object is to occupy a designated spot on the map more than anyone else, and "Kill the Guy with the Ball" where the object is to hold a skull the longest, the player holding it being unable to fire weapons.

Description=Mass Effect (the first part in a planned trilogy) features the unique chance to play as Jack Bauer in space.<br><br>The bigger story of the trilogy is that in every 50,000 years a very cool looking portal, decorated heavily with Hollywood quality special effects, will open up and destroy all life in the universe. <br><br>But the story of this chapter deals with Commander Shepard, supposedly the first human candidate for the elite group of special agents (the Spectres), who serve the inter-galactic Council, comprised of the oldest and most powerful races in the universe. With or without the help of the Council, Shepard has to stop Saren, a Spectre member who went rogue and tries to exact revenge upon the human race.<br><br>In Mass Effect you play as Commander Shepard - who is fully customizable in the character creation screen, you can make him/her look any way you want. Also Commander Shepard, both female and male versions of the character, is fully voiced.<br><br>Mass Effect introduces a new conversation system in which responses to NPC's are displayed and can be chosen before the NPC has finished speaking. This, combined with detailed facial expressions, allows for more fluid and natural conversations.<br><br>Combat in Mass Effect takes place in real time, and is similar to tactical squad-based shooters. Much like in BioWare's previous game, Knights of the Old Republic, the player can pause at any time to give orders to other squad members. The squad members are AI-dependable, but general commands (such as run forward, take cover, target a specific enemy, etc) can be issued without pausing.<br><br>Mass Effect comes with less "black and white" morality than in previous BioWare games. There are two sides of morality in this title - Paragon and Renegade, with Paragon being a more diplomatic, official military courtesy following character and Renegade being the ends justify the means, damning everything to hell kind of character.<br><br>The main quest with its choices and consequences is only a small part of the experience - there are several optional planets of side-questing and exploration and there will be a lot more, since the idea is to keep public interest up with downloadable content, until the sequel.<br><br>The PC-version of Mass Effect differs in some points from the Xbox360 release. Besides higher resolution graphics, the mini game about hacking a computer has been changed. Now instead of playing "Simon Says", the player has to get a triangle into the middle of a circle by avoiding the blocks that are constantly moving around in a Frogger-like fashion. The interface has also undergone massive changes. Besides a new quick slot bar in which the player can assign up to eight abilities for quick access to the number keys, the pause menu has been changed to give the player faster and better control over his teammates. It's now also possible to give every teammate individual orders instead of having both do the same thing. Item management has also been simplified to account for the new keyboard/mouse control scheme which also allows for better precision in the shooter-like fights.

Description=Saren and the Sovereign have been defeated and the Citadel has been saved. Depending on your choices made in the first mass effect, humanity may be all that's left of the Citadel Council. Of course that doesn't keep them from ignoring the former war-hero Shepard who knows that the threat from the Reapers is still real. Instead they send him/her on a boring mission to find some Geth in the Terminus-system. The inevitable happens: a new enemy enters the scene, destroys Shepard's ship, the Normandy and kill the hero of the galaxy. End of game?<br><br>No, not really. Cerberus, a known right-wing terrorist-network believes the threat from the Reapers to be real and only sees one chance of saving the human race: Shepard. So they invest millions upon millions of credits into the Lazarus-project and two years after Shepard did his/her last breath floating in space, he/she reawakens on-board Cerberus-Station. His/her main mission given by Cerberus: find out who abducts millions of human colonists and for what purpose and put a stop to them. Needless to say that these Collectors also have a connection to the Reapers.<br><br>Mass Effect 2 is even more than Mass Effect an action-oriented third-person-shooter mixed with role-playing-elements. After the prologue where the player witnesses the destruction of the original Normandy, he has to create a new character and choose from one of six classes each whit its own powers. The decision also influences which weapons the player can use during play-through as only the soldier can wield every weapon in the game. During the course of the game the player and his squad-mates earn experience points by killing enemies, fulfilling missions and hacking safes in order to get a level up. For each level-up between 1-20, two talent points are awarded, from 21 to the max-level of 30 only one, with which the players powers can be upgraded in four stages. Once the last upgrade has been purchased, a specialization has to be chosen making the talent even more powerful in one aspect. All this goes also for the player squad-mates. The player starts with two companions at his side but can collect up to ten during the course of the game. While he is only allowed to bring two with him into a mission, the collected experience points will be equally shared with those that are left behind.<br><br>Fighting is done in a Gears of War-like fashion with the characters being able to storm into cover and looking out to get in a few shots. In addition health and shield energy is regenerated automatically if the player or his squad-mates avoid being hit for a few seconds. To fight the various kinds of enemies, each class has access to different types of weapons like the sniper rifle and heavy pistol for the infiltrator as well as five different kinds of heavy weapons. The weapons now require ammunition which is either dropped by killed enemies or scattered around the level but there's only two types: one for the heavy weapons and one for all others. Heavy weapons like the grenade launcher come with a very limited supply of ammunition but are very powerful even against full-blown mechs.<br><br>Inventory-management has been removed entirely. The player is only able to change the weapons-load-out of his team from the small set he will collect during the course of the game. His squad-mates don't even have different armor anymore, only the player can change his appearance by researching new armor-parts and put them together to a full suit in his cabin aboard the Normandy. Through research the player also gets access to upgrades to the Normandy, his squad-mates and their tools. To do research the player not only needs to find/buy the plans for the upgrade but also needs enough minerals. The four types of minerals in the game are either found in chests during a mission or collected through a scanning-mini-game on the galaxy-map. In the mini-game the player uses a cursor to move around the face of the planet and send in probes if he finds a mineral source. Side-quests can also be found this way and are shown as anomalies on a planet.<br><br>Besides the combat, the second most important part of the game are the multiple-choice dialogues. The decisions the player makes here heavily influence the players path deciding if he will become a bad or a good person. To that end not only the dialogue choices are sorted by good, neutral and bad but special dialogue options are available for each path if the player has enough points in it that can end a dialogue prematurely to the heroes favor. In addition quick-time-events have been introduced where the player can perform an alignment-action independent from his current path like hitting an obnoxious reporter in the face to shut her up.<br><br>As opposed to the first game, the PC- and the Xbox-360-versions are identical. The only difference is the interface which features a radial menu with the ability to put four powers on hot-keys as opposed to the PC-version which features a mouse-controlled drag-&-drop-interface and a quick-slot-ribbon for up to eight powers to be activated by using the number keys. On both platforms the player can directly use the powers his squad-mates possess.<br><br>One of the most important features of Mass Effect 2 is the ability to import a character from the first game. While the character itself including class and appearance can still be changed at the beginning of the game, he will get a huge bonus both in credits, experience points and minerals at the start of the game depending on the character-level he had at the end. In addition hundreds of decisions the player made in the first game will have an impact on more or less important parts of Mass Effect 2. This includes the state of the universe at the beginning of the game (see first paragraph), which romances the player pursued and which of his squad-mates died or survived the end as well as minor decisions like the survival of the Rachni-queen. If Shepard survives the end of Mass Effect 2, the player will be able to carry him over to Mass Effect 3, too.

The parachute-jump allows you a little freedom in the selection of your starting point. There's also always a certain area, where you get a bonus if you successfully land there. During these missions anti-aircraft weapons need to be blown up, fellow soldiers have to be rescued and enemy tanks need to be taking out using bazookas. In order to give you more choices in your loadout, you are not only given access to enemy weapons but you can the upgrades you played free. You get an upgrade when you are performing extraordinary feats of valour and marksmanship. This means for example that you earn an upgrade when you kill three enemies in a short order. These upgrades include a bigger magazine for the German K98 or a handle for the Thompson machine gun to make it more accurate.<br><br>Also notable is the health-system. Boyd has four beads of health. If an enemy hits you but doesn't empty a whole bead, your health will regenerate until the bead is full again.

Description=Peace at last in the future...but wait!  Robots are rampaging across the cities, and they've been built by...Dr. Light?  Dr. Wily insists that he is not to blame, and asks for contributions to his Swiss Bank account to build his own robots to stop Dr. Light's robots and save the world.  Mega Man knows that something fishy is up, and sets out to stop these new eight robots himself, and clear his creator's name!<br><br>Mega Man 9 comes eight years after the previous entry, Mega Man 8.  Rather than continuing with the detailed look of the previous games, it winds the clock back, creating a visual and audio style similar to the original NES games (including the option of sprite flicker).<br><br>As with the previous games, players run, jump and shoot their way through a variety of robots to reach the boss of that stage.  Upon defeating the boss, Mega Man gains their weapon for his own use.  Mega Man can no longer slide as he could in Mega Man 3, and his charge shot ability from Mega Man 4 has also been removed.<br><br>Mega Man 9 features something new to the series, called Challenges.  These are a list of tasks set for the player to extend the gameplay.  Some are relatively easy, such as defeating a boss using the Mega Buster, while others are much more difficult, such as finishing the game five times in a single day.  The game also features a Time Attack mode, where players race against the clock.

Description=Mercenaries 2: World in Flames takes place in Venezuela and begins with the player choosing one of three mercenaries from the original game (Mattias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs and Jennifer Mui). Each merc has a special ability. Jennifer for example can run fast but Mattias regenerates his health faster but in the end they all are contracted by a Venezuelan billionaire, Ramon Solano, to rescue a general named Carlos Carmona who attempted a coup dtat and failed. Once the player succeeds, Solano and Carmona refuse to pay and try to kill the mercenary.<br><br>Afterwards, Carmona and Solano take over Venezuela, pulling of a successful coup, seizing the countries oil platforms, putting the world on alert as they seize total control of the country. Unknown to them, the players mercenary has survived and is now plotting revenge on the pair. The player must take contracts from rival factions such as Universal Petroleum, an oil company who's business is threatened by Solano, the P.L.A.V. (Peoples Liberation Army of Venezuela), who are a force of rebel soldiers determined to take back their country, The Jamaican Pirates, who profit from Solano's forces, The A.N. (Allied Nations), who have entered the company to try and bring back stability to the region and The Chinese Army, who hope to take control of Venezuela as well, marking themselves as a true superpower.<br><br>The gameplay is basically the same as the previous version, with the control scheme virtually the same, but there are some tweaks as well. One of which is a new way to hijack a vehicle. Whereas in the previous game the player could simply walk up to the vehicle and automatically hijack, now they must kill the gunner of the vehicle and then enter a "mini-game", pressing a certain button or rotating the analog stick in a certain way to successfully hijack the vehicle. Likewise, players can also use a grappling hook to latch on to passing helicopters to make it easier to hijack. Players can now swim, whereas in the previous game the player would die the instant they hit the water.<br><br>Players now have a "headquarters" of sort, where the player can stockpile weapons, supply crates and vehicles. To obtain these stockpiles the player must recruit three certain soldiers unlockable in the game. A helicopter pilot named Ewan Garrett, who delivers stockpile crates found by the player in the world to the PMC as well as medivacs the player, a mechanic named Eva Navarro, who will repair and stock vehicles when you return them to the villa and is used for artillery strikes and a fighter pilot named Misha Milanich, who is used for air strikes. Players can use these by calling in Ewan to deliver their supplies via helicopter. Also Fiona Taylor reprises her role, giving the player technical information and training missions.<br><br>There is no more black market contacts to purchase supplies or airstrikes, instead players must take complete jobs for contacts scattered on the island, completing jobs for these contacts will supply the player's headquarters with materials such as weapons, medikits, and artillery support. Players can also stockpile vehicles by driving back to their headquarters, keeping them at the garage for use in missions. Also, players must have gas as well now to bring in supplies or call in airstrikes, which can be obtained by either completing contracts or collecting them scattered throughout the country.<br><br>Once again, bounties come into play, but instead of the "Deck of 52" from the first game, they are now "High Value Targets", military leaders that have defected from the Venezuela military and declared themselves independent from Solano as well as competing factions. They are scattered throughout the map, capturing them alive will give the player more money, while killing them will only reward the player half the bounty. There are also "treasures" lying around the island, such as fuel cans, weapons schematics and even pirate treasure chests as well, each has their own monetary value for collecting them.<br><br>There are also new vehicles in the game, as well classic vehicles, such as modernized tanks, more powerful helicopters and even for the first time boats and other watercraft such as jet skis as well as civilian muscle cars, high-end racing cars, as well as specialized vehicles for each faction.<br><br>There is also a Playstation 2-release of the game available. It was developed by Artificial Mind and Motion and uses the graphics engine from Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. And although the background story and basic gameplay remain the same, the PS2-version mainly features around 40 exclusive side-missions, has no co-op play and takes place on a much smaller map.

Description=The story of Metro 2033 is based on the Russian book of the same name by author Dmitry Gulkovsky. The plot takes place in Moscow or more specifically, in the subway-tunnels of the city. The city itself has become inhabitable after the events in 2013 when almost all of humanity was wiped out and Earth's surface became a nuclear wasteland. As the name suggests, the game takes place twenty years after that and puts the player in the shoes of Artyom, born a few days before the apocalypse but raised in the underground. Up until now he had never left the relative safety of the subway-city but something terrible is about to happen and Artyom is tasked to warn the remains of humanity from the upcoming danger, requiring him to travel through the tunnels and even through the nuclear winter above.<br><br>Artyom's journey is a dangerous one. As the player explores the tunnels in a typical, rather linear first-person-shooter-fashion, he has to face many obstacles. Mutants being the most easy to spot and dispose of thanks to the vast arsenal of weaponry including of course the AK-47 but also more or less fictional ones like the Tihar sniper rifle or the Ubojnik automatic shotgun. The player can only carry a sidearm and two primary weapons at the same time. Dynamite sticks and knives complete the set. All weapons come in different variations with scopes, silencer and other upgrades attached. While the upgrades can't be bought individually, already upgraded weapons can be bought at shops in the few metro-cities in the game in exchange for the old weapon and military-grade ammunition - the only currency in the game and much more powerful than the easy to find standard-, so-called "dirty", ammunition. If Artyom is hit, he regenerates his health automatically but medipacks are available to instantly rehabilitate him and increase the regeneration rate for a few seconds.<br><br>More dangerous than the mutants are environmental hazards -foremost of course nuclear tainted water and waste but also poisoned areas in which the player needs to equip his gas mask in order to survive. The filter of the gas mask wears down as its being used (indicated by Artyom's special watch and his heavier breathing) and can even be damaged in melee-fights, straining the filter even more. Other tools available to Artyom are a pair of night vision goggles, a flashlight, a light-meter, a lighter, his journal with a compass and a charging device. The latter is required to manually recharge the flashlight and the night vision goggles once their energy gets low. The light-meter on the other hand helps Artyom to determine if he's hidden in the shadows or visible from miles away, helping him to avoid some dangers. Other environmental hazards include seeking anomalies and strange but deadly visions.

Description=Minesweeper Flags is based on the Minesweeper game that is included in some versions of Microsoft Windows. Players must locate mines on a minefield by first selecting an initial square which they believe does not contain a mine. If they are successful in finding one without a mine, it will reveal some squares around it that also do not contain mines, some of which will be blank, but some will have numbers in them. These numbers reveal how many mines are located around that square, but will not give you any hint as to where they are or how far away they are. The player must now use this information to identify the rest of the squares that do not have mines in them (marking). If the player is successful, the entire board can be cleared and the bombs can be secured. If the player however selects a square with a mine in it, the mine will detonate and it will be game over. There is a counter at the bottom that helps determine the amount of mines and a general timer to show how long it is taking you.<br><br>Unlike the original 2D Minesweeper, Flags' grids are themed 3 dimensional, with you having a semi top-down view of the playing field. Game modes included are the classic single player game and the same mode in multiplayer (player taking turns selecting a square, the first to land a mine loses the game). There are loose matches and a campaign mode that stretches along the seven continents with different matches. In the campaign mode puzzles are not always square. There are sometimes multiple lives, shown through a heart indicator near the top of the screen. It also includes an all new multiplayer only mode called "Flags", in which the mines are replaced by various coloured flags, but unlike with the original game, you are trying to find, not avoid, them, and you have to find them before your opponent. The rules can be customized based on the turn time limit, the number of players, the difficulty level, and altering two conditions where another move is provided when a flag is found, and the ability to win early.

When none of them returns, he is left with his last choice: the young ninja Hiro and his blunt friend Futo. Players control the characters through different worlds using a third-person perspective with a relative amount of freedom to explore the environment. When lost, the characters can meditate to receive a hint and see an arrow that points into the general direction of the next objective.<br><br>During the course of the game they will follow the steps of the other warriors and eventually free four of them to make them playable. The player can switch between any character at any given moment. Each ninja has different abilities. Hiro is an allrounder and the only ninja who can use Kuji spells. Unlocked by finding and praying at hidden shrines, spells include fireballs, whirlwinds and the ability to enter a spirit form where animals can be taken over to have them fight. They also make it easier to spot items and collectibles in the environment. Animals are locked up in cages but also appear when an enemy is defeated and they return to their original form. Futo wields a large hammer and is especially useful to engage larger enemies. The other characters that become available during the course of the game are Suzume, a young girl with a flute that enchants enemies when she plays music, Shun, a master with the bow, Tora who thinks he's a tiger and has big metal claws to proof it, and the acrobat Kunoichi with a long spear.<br><br>Characters have basic attacks along with a defence breaker to stun enemies and the ability to block. Acrobatic moves include wall jumping, running along walls and hanging from ledges. All characters have a sneak mode where they can hide in the grass or the environment to cause more damage when attacking or to simply avoid confrontations. Health is restored by gathering fruit and there are collectible items in the environments. When new recipes are bought, these items can be mixed into potions, bombs and power-ups. Characters level up to get better abilities and they all have a different focus attack to cause more damage.

Description=Mirror's Edge is a first-person action game set in a dystopian society ruled by a totalitarian regime that exercises a high amount of surveillance on citizens. The city has a clean look, with bright cold tone visuals that are mainly white with hints of orange. Players control Faith, a female runner who transfers information by moving over the roofs of the city as all other forms of communication are monitored. She grew up alone in the streets when her mother died during the November Riots and her father deserted her shortly after. She was taught as a little girl by a man called Mercury, who caught her breaking in and was impressed with her skills. Hunted down by a government agents, she needs to find a way to free her sister.<br><br>Based on the principles of parkour, the focus is on the freedom of movement. Although the game path is largely linear, the controls are largely context-sensitive and she needs to string up moves to build up a fluid flow of movement, by running up walls, sliding below fences, or by jumping, vaulting or climbing, using pipes, ramps or using objects as zip-lines. The emphasis on movement is enhanced through the camera, which spins, or bobs up and down according to the speed, and the prominent visibility of her arms, legs and torso. The game is also largely HUDless. When Faith is hurt, the city's colours desaturate. To assist the player in this fast-paced movement, the game applies Runner Vision where environmental pieces are highlighted when they occur to Faith as possible escape routes. In complex situations, Reaction Time, a form of bullet time, can be applied to slow down the pace without losing momentum.<br><br>Even though Faith generally needs to run from agents who chase her on foot or from helicopters, she can attack them using melee combat, or disarm agents to grab and wield their weapons. The game takes place both outside, and inside buildings and there are ten chapters in total. The story is furthered through animated films between the missions, not using the game engine. Next to the main story mode, there is a time attack mode with portions of levels and the fastest times are shown as red runners who act as ghosts. While playing, hidden messenger bags can be collected to unlock extras.

Description=The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom is a platform game focused on puzzle solving, similar in concept to Braid. It is the commercial reworking of a student project flash game. Entirely visualized in black-and-white, the game imitates a silent film style, with written, rhyming text between scenes, grain, piano music and a glowing aesthetic that makes it look projected in an old-fashioned theatre. Players control P.B. Winterbottom, a notorious thief with an insatiable hunger for pies. The game has the player guide Winterbottom as he chases a large, challenging pie, slipping through his fingers whenever he manages to get close to it. After a linear tutorial level the player can choose different movie levels or bonus areas from a main hub.<br><br>Basic controls allow Winterbottom to move around, jump, float using his umbrella, reach higher areas through springs, or flick his umbrella as a means to operate switches. The most important mechanic becomes the manipulation of time. Some levels offer the ability to record a set number of clones. Keeping the right trigger pressed, the player can record Winterbottom's actions and then use the looping clone to reach higher areas or have him operate switches. By distorting time, which was triggered when Winterbottom entered a strange portal when chasing the pie, often multiple clones can be recorded after each other and redundant ones can be whacked to remove them. To cross gaps Winterbottom often needs to force the clones to whack him. To progress the player needs to cooperate with past versions of itself, a tactic also employed in Braid or the Cursor*10 series. The main difference is that the clones can still be interacted with, regardless of their timeline. To end a level a number of pies needs to be selected or the main pie needs to be chased.<br><br>Advanced levels feature evil pies. These automatically spawn an evil clone that follows the player's path to get the pie before the player does. As another evil pie spawns at that point, the player needs to find a way to collect it without crossing the path of the evil clone. Grabbing the second evil pie spawns another evil clone and so on, making it more and more difficult to move around in the level without being harmed. Aside from those evil clones there are no general enemies to defeat and when dying - usually when jumping down a gap - the section can be immediately replayed.

Clearing a stage will add the picture beneath to an in-game gallery. After clearing the regular mode, "Special" mode unlocks featuring five more girls with three difficulties each. In these stage, the player must clear five puzzles in order, within an increasingly strict time limit. In both modes, the player must clear all stages at each difficulty before moving on to the next.<br><br>The game includes the aforementioned gallery mode where any cleared images may be viewed.

Description=Monday Night Combat is a colourful, futuristic third-person shooter with cloned soldiers who fight in a competitive sport in enclosed arenas, complete with a live announcer and an audience. It is played with teams of soldiers of different classes. The two game modes are Blitz and Crossfire. Blitz is a cooperative mode where a team of one to four players (additionally with bots instead of human players) fights against different waves of enemies who attempt to reach the Moneyball - a central structure that needs to be guarded and defended against attacks. In this game mode there are five different challenges and there are many types of robots that each require a specific strategy to defeat them. The second game mode is Crossfire and it is played online with two teams of six players. The goal is to get hold of the opponent's Moneyball, but in order to do that AI-controlled  Breach Bots need to be guided inside the enemy base so they can take down the shields first.<br><br>Players collect and spend money in-game. It can be used to activate jump pads, purchase upgrades for different skills and enhanced abilities, and build and repair turrets. There are four types of turrets that can be installed on fixed spots. They are of vital importance in matches to keep the enemy busy and protect passages, especially near the Moneyball. Cash is left behind by defeated enemies and at the end of the match there is also a mascot, similar to the dwarfs of the original Golden Axe game, who can be chased and hit to make him drop money. Efficient resource management is often necessary to get goods results. When dying the player re-spawns after a cool-down time, but with no money charge.<br><br>The player can shoot with different weapons, use objects, reload, zoom, use different skills, perform melee attacks, and taunt other players. After defeating a number of enemies it is possible to activate Juice, which temporarily charges the character to move faster and do more damage. Many of the other abilities depend on the chosen class, with different characters somewhat similar to Team Fortress 2. The six classes are Assault, Tank, Personal, Assassin, Gunner, and Sniper.<br><br>1. Assault is an all-round character with an assault rifle and a grenade launcher. He can launch bombs and detonate them remotely, fly for a short while using hover jets, and charge towards opponents to knock them out of the arena.<br><br>2. Tank is the strongest character, but also fairly slow. He attacks using a jet gun and a rail gun, and his skills consist of a grenade that can also blind enemies, a charge attack, and the ability to deploy himself at a fixed position to deal more damage and lose less health.<br><br>3. Personal is a typical support character similar to a medic or an engineer. He has a shotgun that can also fire a grapple, but his main gun heals allies and drains health from opponents to transfer it to his team. He can hack into turrets to upgrade the abilities, deploy a firebase, and call in an airstrike.<br><br>4. Assassin is the stealth character. He is very fast and fights uses a dagger for close combat, which is turned into a sword after upgrades. The alternate fire is a grapple. The second main weapon is a shuriken launcher. His most important skills are cloak to become invisible, a dash attack, and a smoke bomb.<br><br>5. Gunner is another slow, but very strong character. He fights with a minigun and a mortar launcher that deal a lot of damage. His slam attack pushes enemies away, he can deploy himself to deal more damage, similar to Tank, and he can grapple opponents and throw them.<br><br>6. Sniper is another fast character for players with great accuracy. His main weapon is the sniper rifle to take out enemies from a distance, but he also has an SMG, along with a grapple. Special skills include a flak grenade, the ability to set traps that slow down enemies, and a sniper grapple that spins or throws opponents.

Description=Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge - Special Edition is a remake of Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. After the happenings of The Secret of Monkey Island Guybrush came to fame but it is fading away. Now he is on the search for the famous treasure Big Whoop but unfortunately he is stuck on Scabb Island where Largo LaGrande, a former employee of Le Chuck, has the commando and steals all of Guybrush's riches... His first goal is to leave Scabb Island and later his search for Big Whoop gets more personal because an old enemy comes back to life...<br><br>Regarding gameplay the game doesn't change much in comparison to its predecessor: the player explores his environment, solves item based puzzles and talks to a lot of people through multiple choice dialogues. The biggest part of the game is the search or a treasure map during which the player has to solve interconnected puzzles on three islands.<br><br>The three main new features of this Special Edition are the all-new graphics (which utilize a strong comic-style), full voice acting (this time also available while playing with the original graphics) and new controls similar to the coin control of The Curse of Monkey Island: when right clicking on an object all valid verbs pop up. Optionally the player can circle through the verbs to change the default command for the left mouse button. Of course he can always switch to the original version where he has the original SCUMM-Interface available: on the bottom of the screen are nine verbs. To start an action the player has to choose one of these verbs and then click on an item in the game world or the inventory.<br><br>New players who are not familiar with the original game can use two features to make their life easier: a hint system and the possibility to lighten up all interactive elements on the screen. On the other hand the "easy" mode from the original game is not included. The optional in-game commentary by Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman can be activated during certain points and scenes of the game and gives background information about the development of the original game.

Load your shotgun, zombies have run amuck in town and it's up to four teenagers to defend their suburbia in this 3rd person shooter while seeking to find the cause of this invasion. In single player mode (which also can be played in co-op with up to three friends),  you go through five areas: Shopping Maul, High School Hell, Cemetery Scary, and Evil Castle. Each area has 3 to 5 stages.  <br><br>You choose one of the characters to play as, each with their own special abilities: Zack the geek uses ax-type weapons, Carrie the Goth likes swords, Andy the surfer dude uses random objects like toilet plungers and does a Neo-like spin on his weapon to kick enemies around him, and Jennifer the dumb blonde cheerleader has dual batons which can be spun into a tornado-like effect. New weapons and weapon upgrades can be bought from the local mechanic with collected items found throughout each level, and with tokens dropped when zombies die. By using their favorite melee weapon, each character can make a special attack move when their power bar is at maximum level from killing enemies. There's also 16 unique guns built from 25 different  weapon parts found in each level and with 3 different upgradable levels of power.  Other weapons include wacky ones like lawnmowers, nailguns, cellphone tazers, bicycle grenade launchers, defribulators, and CD shooters, as well as more traditional Molotov cocktails, rocket launchers, and pipe shotguns. Later in the game, even vehicles and ships can be used such as a UFO which has a laser death beam. <br><br>Using the Unreal Engine 3 and Ageia's PhysX enables realistic physics-based destruction along with detailed lighting, environmental and character details. The plot is moved forward by comic-strip cut scenes, including showing the name and abilities of new zombie mutations as they first appear.

Play is similar to the 2D Mortal Kombat games (with some 3D elements), focusing more on the special move aspect than the complex combos found in the previous three games (Deadly Alliance, Deception, Armageddon).<br><br>In addition, there are new modes of fighting found with in the gameplay: Klose Kombat, Freefall Kombat, and "Test Your Might", which use the environment as a mini-game style scenario to inflict stylized and extensive damage on an opponent, as well as "Rage", which turns standard moves into a devastating opportunity to crush your opponent.  Players battle through such locales as Gotham City, Metropolis, the Shaolin Temples, or Earthrealm's Hell.<br><br>As with any Mortal Kombat game, Fatalities are still present for the Kombatants and villains, though slightly toned down to meet the DC standards of heroes such as Superman and Batman keeping to their moral code and not killing their opponent.  As a result, the DC heroes perform "Heroic Brutalities", which effectively put their opponent out of commission.<br><br>Online play is also available for players to take their fights online for ranked matches, play against a friend, or another online opponent in tournaments.

Initially the many different races of the world lived in peace, a power granted by mythical orb which created the world. However, the orb is mysteriously shattered which leads the different races (humans, elves, orcs, goblins, and more) to distrust each other and eventually leads to the giant, unnamed battle. Throughout the game you control seven different characters, each of which provide a different perspective on the battle. Some parts of each characters story overlap allowing a different point of view while other parts are unique. Initially only one character is available, and by progressing through the game the additional characters will be unlocked; in order to see the complete story you will need to complete all of the scenarios for each character.<br><br>Each scenario in the game is a large scale battle involving hundreds of opponents to defeat; each character you control has a variety of moves available and as you level up additional moves become available. The varying maneuvers available are performed by pressing different button combos on the controller. As you defeat enemies red orb crystals are earned which fill a meter; when the orb meter is finally full you are able to perform a more powerful attack capable of taking out many foes. While performing this attack you earn blue orb crystals which fill up a second meter; when that meter is full you have one of your most powerful attacks available to you. <br><br>Since you will be fighting a significant number of enemies at one time you don't enter battle alone; two groups of warrior guard units fight with you. At the beginning of each mission you can choose the type of guard units to bring with you, such as archers who specialize in long range attacks or the infantry who are better at close range combat. You also have the ability to give them some simple commands such as calling the guards to your side for protection or attacking a target.<br><br>As you progress through the missions, different items can be found. These include more powerful weapons, improved armor, or magical items which increase your hit points or decrease damage received. After each mission a new mission will become available on the world map; you have the option of playing or replaying any of the missions which are unlocked on the map which allows you to level up on easier missions if you have trouble defeating one of the tougher ones.

Description=Naughty Bear is a third-person action game with a theme similar to Happy Tree Friends or Conker's Bad Fur Day, where cute, plushy animals act more violently than they usually do - mixing dark humour with over-the-top violence. Players control the eponymous bear to gain as many points as possible by doing naughty things, generally a euphemism for killing other animals and destroying their possessions. The game is set on Perfection Island where teddy bears live happily. Naughty is somewhat of an outsider because of his demeanour and he is the only one not invited to the birthday party of Daddles. He tries to go anyway, crafting a present for the occasion, but his gift is ridiculed by two other bears, Chubby and Giggles, and he sulkily goes back home, plotting for revenge.<br><br>The game takes place over the course of seven episodes, further divided into separate missions. Every mission has several quests to be completed, such as killing a specific bear, beating the time limit, collecting gifts, or staying undetected (Naughty Bear can hold a branch with leafs in front of his face to hide). Completing these assignments and killing other bears is rewarded with points, which opens up bridges or gates to go to new areas. That way in-game trophies (bronze, silver, gold) can be gathered, based on the amount of points, to open up new levels and unlock additional costumes, improved abilities, and badges. If the naughtiness goes on uninterruptedly, a multiplier is built up. Each chapter is a separate story slice, showing how Naughty Bear is spied on by birds, or is not invited to a cookery lesson.<br><br>Naughty Bear attacks with knives, golf clubs, legs of meat, machetes and guns - infiltrating cabins, running through the woods, and hacking away at everything he encounters. These weapons can be picked up in the levels and there is also the option to set traps and use contextual weapons involving car doors for instance, or sabotaging phone lines and escape vehicles. That way it is also possible to use a more tactical approach: sneaking around, remaining undetected and luring the other bears in your direction by sabotaging their everyday items. Chasing them is sometimes more difficult as they can warn the others or barricade themselves in their houses. Every weapon has a finishing move that can be used when another bear is hurt, shown as a short animation. There are regular bears, but later levels introduce more difficult ninja, zombie, cop, and alien bears. One button is used to hit and tapping it repeatedly forms a combo. Naughty Bear can also dodge, and use a scare attack. By torturing and haunting others repeatedly, bears can even go suicidal and start beating themselves. Most items can be smashed or destroyed by throwing them into a toilet for instance.<br><br>Multiplayer is supported with four different modes. Along with basic deathmatch (Assault), there is Cakewalk (hold on to a golden cake as long as possible), Golden Oozy (get control of a powerful gun), and Jelly Wars (collect jellies faster than the opponents).

Description=The 2006 game in the Need for Speed series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.<br><br>Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.<br><br>The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.<br><br>The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.

As opposed to its predecessors, this doesn't mean racing around an open-world city with pimped cars. Instead the game is more similar to GRID with races taking place on closed city circuits or even famous race tracks like the Circuit de Spa-Franchorchamps.<br><br>At the beginning of the game, the player drives a test-round as well as a race. During this tutorial the game evaluates the player's skill and changes the realism settings accordingly ranging from the usual arcade-style controls with many driving aids to an almost realistic simulation-like driving model. Then the main game begins where the player has to successfully earn stars in order to unlock the next tier and ultimately gain access to the World Tour. Stars are earned by getting on the podium at the end of a race as well as by fulfilling certain objectives on the track. These range from simply gaining a specific amount of points in the race to more challenging objectives like driving a clean lap. Points on the other hand are earned by the player through his driving style and are separated into two groups: Precision and Aggression. While the first group honors clean sectors or driving on the race line, aggression-points are earned by hitting other cars or sliding through curves. Once the player has earned enough points (both categories are summed-up at the end of an event, he gains a level and by doing so unlocks new upgrades for his car, get's a big money bonus or receives an invite to a special race event. To keep the player even more motivated, tons of badges are waiting to be earned which are in part also the same as the available achievements/trophies. Again actions like performing 25 overtakes or winning three consecutive races are needed to earn a minor badge. If he keeps his streak up or has earned all the minor badges in one category, he earns additional badges ranging from bronze to epic.<br><br>The available events include normal races in various variations, a time attack mode, a car attack in which the player needs to be either five seconds in front of his opponent or get 1st place in order to win and drift events. The car park includes many licensed cars from normal middle to high class vehicles to high-powered racing cars which can all be bought through the money earned by winning races or leveling up. In addition the look of the car can be changed by unlocking new vinyls. Also available are extensive upgrade and tuning options allowing the player to change every detail on his car down to the tire pressure.

Other missions require the player to bring a specific car in the best possible condition to a garage. Since the player is undercover, the police is always watching him and makes his life more and more difficult as the wanted level of the car increases.<br><br>Successful races not only earn the player reputation to unlock new challenges and new parts of the city but also bring cash which can be invested in new cars or in the tuning of old ones. In addition one of the ten stats of the character automatically advances granting him more money for a win or increasing his ability to brake.

The 2-on-2 and 4-on4 modes allow you and a friend to hand-pick a team of players (3 or 5, depending on the mode) and face off in a wide-open, arcade-style hockey game. Shootout works exactly like a shootout in real hockey: three skaters per side alternate taking shots at the goaltender, and most goals wins.

These parasites cannot be countered with any known medicine and spread through the blood stream of their victims, rewriting their genetic code and turning them into much stronger monsters. They escaped the research facility and the situation quickly became uncontainable, resulting in the drop of an atomic bomb on the site. Since then there have been several contained outbreaks all over the world which have all been stopped by the G.U.I.D.E.-squad, a special forces unit consisting of Ninjas especially trained for these outbreaks.<br><br>The game starts in 2015 with another outbreak happening in Tokyo. But as opposed to the previous outbreaks, the parasites are spreading much faster and only a few days after the first infection, the first sky-high level-5-infected are sighted. So once again the team is sent in to deal with the situation. Part of the team: Ken Ogawa.<br><br>The player takes on the role of Ken Ogawa and quickly finds himself without his team-mates and betrayed by his own father. Bound to duty but driven by revenge, the player controls him from a classic 3rd-person-perspective through the nine, very long levels. A great part of the game plays similar to Devil May Cry 4 with the player using his three different kind of swords (balanced, slow and fast) as well as a over-sized throwing star to deal with the infected, using the available combos. All the weapons are upgradeable in several stages by using the Blood Crystals that all killed enemies drop. The throwing star also gains additional abilities during the course of the game turning him e.g. into a fire extinguisher or burning projectile. There are also jump-'n'-run-elements included, requiring the player to use wall-walk or swinging on rails to advance through the level. <br><br>The game also calls itself an interactive movie and this is where the second core gameplay mechanic comes into play: Quick Time Events. The levels are designed like one big boss fight where the player encounters the final boss of the level right from the start and follows him or is chased by him through hordes of normal enemies, jump-n-run-passages and intermediate-bosses. To keep the action going and looking impressive, the game constantly switches fluently to Quick Time Events, indicated by a quick zoom onto Ken's eye. From this moment on, the player just need to follow the instructions on-screen and watch the carnage unfold. If he fails to hit a button at the right moment, the game rewinds the time back a little but no further than to the start of the Quick Time Event. Since Quick Time Events play an important role, their difficulty level can be adjusted independently from the one for normal gameplay.<br><br>At the end of the level, the player is rated based on several factors, gaining him additional Blood Crystals or unlocking new customization options like a new emblem or a suit for Ken.

Description=Work your way up the corporate ladder, experience life as an office employee and see where it takes you. In this satirical simulation game you take on the role as Jennifer, starting from your first day at work at a new office. Here you get to do exciting office-related tasks like mailing documents, obtaining a parking pass and even saving the company! Try to keep your spirits up too since you'll be facing all the dreaded office-related difficulties such as layoffs, reorganizing and your boss. It's important that you tend to your bodily functions too. This is handled with a The Sims-like system where you see how much you need to empty your bladder, sleep, eat and drink. When one of your motives falls to a critical level, a stress meter will show up and increase, eventually causing you to quit your job and resulting in game over. The gameplay is accompanied by satirical dialogue, poking fun at pretty much everything there is to office work.

Description=Old School Racer is a physics-based racing platform game much like the popular Trials series or Elasto Mania. While the primary goal of each stage is to reach the end as quickly as possible, there is also incentive to stop and explore, with many hidden paths and shortcuts through each course, and many hidden tokens to find. These tokens can be used to unlock more powerful bikes, which helps the player improve their best times and collect previously-unreachable tokens.<br><br>The player's bike can move forward and backward, brake, and even boost for a short period. If the player crashes or overuses the boost, their bike will explode and they will be sent back a short distance in the stage, but there is otherwise no real penalty for crashing. There are more than a dozen bikes to unlock and more than twenty courses of varying difficulty, even including "wacky" courses and challenge stages. The game will track the player's best times on each course, and there are also par times to beat.

Description=Skira is a lovely little island in the Pacific Ocean just north of Japan and was always the center of many conflicts because of its strategic value. Sadly, nice beaches and crystal blue water isn't the only thing Skira has to offer. After the second world war, the Russians managed to gain control over the island and found a huge oil deposit of a size similar to the ones in the middle east. No one cared at first but China's economy grew and grew and with it their need for oil. Then the recession hit. China's manufacturing industry was especially affected and civil unrest got stronger and stronger bringing the country closer and closer to a civil war. Because of these riots the National People's Army guarding the Russian border under the lead of General Zhang was put on high alert, further increasing the tension between China and the international community. As Russia was preparing for the worst-case-scenario, General Zhang suddenly invaded Skira saying that the island is the rightful historical property of China. Since Russia is too busy preparing for a possible war against China on the ground, they ask the USA for assistance in regaining control over the island. Soon afterwards UH-10 Black Hawks are sighted over Skira and in one of those helicopters: the player.<br><br>Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is an action-orientated military-simulation. The player moves through the mission areas in a typical first-person-shooter fashion and has to fulfill certain objectives like blowing up a generator or taking out anti-air-guns in order for the invasion to move along. But since realism plays an important part in this game, the player can't just walk up to the enemy base and shoot everyone. Instead he and his three squad-mates have to use the different stances like crouching and couching to move from cover to cover in different formations and think before a bullet is fired or in short: the player needs to take a tactical approach in order to not end up dead in the high grass. To that end, he has a radial, context-sensitive menu at his disposal with which he can give specific orders to his teammates. In addition, the player can change the weapons-load-out of each team-mate (and himself) at the beginning of each mission to what best fits the situation. The armory only covers real-world weaponry like the MK16 MOD 0 Assault Rifle. If all the sneaking didn't help and combat ensues, the player has to watch both his blood- and injury-status. Depending on where and how badly he has been wounded e.g. his arm, his ability to keep his weapon straight decreases. In addition each wound causes the player to loose blood and of course once he has lost too much blood, he'll loose consciousness and the mission is over.<br><br>The game features several multiplayer-modes. The players can either take on the whole campaign together or just one mission or engage each other in "Destruction", which is similar to Team Deathmatch, or "Infiltration" in which the smaller team has to fulfill an objective while the other has to prevent it from destroying their target. As opposed to the single-player campaign where the player has only limited access to vehicles like jeeps or helicopters, the selection in multiplayer is much greater and covers everything from a HUMVEE to a AH-1 Cobra helicopter. The PC-version also includes a powerful map-editor.

Description=The Outfit is a World War II game that, unlike many other games in the genre, focuses almost entirely on destruction. While you will usually need to take a tactical approach to gameplay when on foot, you will earn points called "Field Units" that can be used to buy equipment like tanks and gun turrets to destroy Axis soldiers. You can simply buy equipment by using the Y button on your controller in conjunction with the left thumbstick button to select an item to buy. As such, the game developers call The Outfit "destruction on demand". The equipment you buy with Field Units will initially be occupied by AI-controlled soldiers, but you can replace whoever is using the equipment so that you can have some fun blowing stuff up. Sporting a fully destructible environment, almost everything in The Outfit can be blown up.<br><br>You can play as one of three characters. Tommy Mac can take lots of damage before dying, and comes equipped with a flamethrower and machine gun, but equipment will cost him more Field Units than other characters. Deuce Williams comes equipped with a rocket launcher and pistol, and doesn't need as much Field Units to buy stuff as Tommy does, but he isn't nearly as strong as Tommy. JD Tyler is the most accurate of the three, sporting a sniper rifle and shotgun, but unfortunately he will die with one shot, so he must take an extremely tactical approach to gameplay.

Although he managed to defeat the final boss and claim hell itself for his vast empire, the Jester once again crossed his plans and doomed him to forever be trapped down there. But was it really the end of the Overlord? Not really. He may be gone (for now) but he left something behind: his son, the Overlad. Smuggled to the icy lands of Nordberg, he managed to grow up in peace until his evil instincts surfaced and he was found by the Empire. Although he managed to escape, he fell into ice water and was doomed to freeze to death. But not to worry: Minion-master Gnarl finds his new master and after 50 years frozen solid it's finally time for vengeance upon the Glorious Empire and its leaders.<br><br>This time setting up shop in the Netherworld, the player takes over the control of the Overlad from a 3rd-person-perspective in order to reclaim the lands. To help him with that task he has once again access to four different types of minions: browns, reds, greens and blues. While the browns are good melee-fighters, the greens are immune to poisonous gas and the blues can swim. This comes in handy for the player to overcome the many obstacles in his way like angry elves and legion soldiers or burning road-blocks which can only be removed by the reds. Again the minions increase their strength by collecting helmets and stuff from dead enemies or broken chests. The Overlad can also increase his strength by finding new spells, armor and weapons and forging the latter in return for a minion-sacrifice in his tower. New this time around is the option to resurrect fallen but valuable minions as well as the ability of the minions to ride mounts like wolves, giving them access to new skills like jumping over obstacles and such. Also new: at specific points the Overlad can take direct control of one of his minion and by doing so access areas that were unreachable before.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer-mode for two players over LAN, WAN and thanks to split-screen even on one machine in which they can either work together to survive wave after wave of enemies or kill a very powerful Centurion or fight each other and win by collecting enough gold or killing the other Overlord enough times.

Description=Panzer General: Allied Assault is a turn-based card/boardgame mix inspired by the Panzer General series. The map is divided into 5*6 squares with the first row on each side being the home row for the respective party. Each tile has different attributes and is more or less important. While a river gives -3 to the attack bonus, attacking while sitting behind a mountain grants +3 defense. Each tile also grants a specific amount of prestige points at the end of each round for the army who previously conquered it by placing a unit on it.<br><br>Prestige points are needed to buy additional cards at the beginning of a round as well as for placing new units like tanks or infantry on the map. Each player can normally only have up to 10 cards in his deck. Cards represent everything in the game from units over actions like ordering a bomb-strike on enemy artillery, to attacks. They can be played out as long as enough prestige points are available. In addition each placed unit can either move one tile each round or attack an enemy. This rule can only be bypassed by playing a Free Attack Action card.<br><br>Combat itself is divided into several stages. First the game looks if an enemy is dug in and gives him the first shot if that is the case. Then the defense and attack points are calculated based on factors like terrain cover, dug-in conditions and support from friendly units on nearby tiles or artillery in range. Afterwards combat cards are played until both players choose to pass. Combat cards allow for example to take out the artillery support via an air strike or just add -3 to the defense rating of the enemy in order to overcome his defense rating. Once both player pass, they can sacrifice a battle card from their available deck to add its worth to either their defense or offense rating as the last means to change the final outcome. To add a little bit of luck to the game, a dice roll follows. Whatever is rolled will be added to the attackers' attack points making him either stronger or weaker. For example: the dice lands on a -3. After the dice fell, the game plays out the combat, dealing out damage as determined by the defense and attack points of each party and then the positions change. The attacker becomes defender and the inital defender is now the attacker. If after the second round one unit still isn't either dead or retreating, the outcome is a draw. Otherwise the winning party gains an additional health point and can choose to advance onto the enemy position if the initial attackers won.<br><br>The game features a campaign with twelve normal and three bonus missions. Successfully completing them inside a set round limit unlocks more or less new cards which are only available in multiplayer. Getting an achievement also grants a new card that can then be used to make custom decks for both the Germans and Americans with the integrated deck builder.

As the matchmaker you ask the contestants questions and judging from their answers you get an idea of what the character likes and dislikes. You only have a certain amount of "match points" to ask questions for each round, The characters can give you an honest answer but also lie to you, making it more of a challenge to figure out who they would match best. The more rounds you use to ask the candidates questions, the smaller your potential winnings will be. Different match levels are available in the game too, for example "shallow" will only match candidates based on their preferences in appearance while "deep" takes both appearance, interests and personality into consideration. A local leaderboard with rankings determined by four different categories is also available.

Description=Plants vs. Zombies belongs to the "tower defense" sub-genre of casual games, where the objective is to deploy a series of stationary weapons to protect a structure against hordes of enemies. Plants provide the artillery, and can be bought with sun power, the game's currency. The enemies are zombies invading a suburban lawn. At the start of each level, the player starts to plant the available seeds on the lawn in a strategic manner. Zombies slowly begin to appear from the street at the right side, just a few initially, and must be destroyed before they can reach the house on the other side. Sun power icons falls from the sky randomly, and must be collected with the mouse to increase the funds. The sunflower can be planted to generate extra units of sun power, but doesn't have any attack power against the invading undead. Besides their cost, the seed packs take some time to recharge after being used.<br><br>There are several types of offensive plants available. Pea shooters are the basic variety, spitting a projectile forwards every few seconds. Variations appear later in the game, shooting several peas at the same time and freezing the enemies, making them move slower. The carnivorous plant gobbles up a zombie when he gets near its gaping mouth, but takes some time to do so, becoming ineffective while busy digesting the corpse. The cherry bomb explodes after being deployed, carbonizing any of the undead surrounding its landing spot. The potato mine is half-buried with a sensor sticking from the top, and detonates when one of the walking dead steps on it. Plants can be removed with the shovel to make space for new ones.<br><br>Mini-games appear from time to time. There are twenty of them, and most are parodies of well-known casual titles: ZomBotany (1 and 2), Wall-nut Bowling (1 and 2), Slot Machine, It's Raining Seeds, Beghouled, Invisi-ghoul, Seeing Stars, Zombiquarium, Beghouled Twist, Big Trouble Little Zombie, Portal Combat, Column Like You See 'Em, Bobsled Bonanza, Zombie Nimble Zombie Quick, Whack a Zombie, Last Stand, Pogo Party, and Dr. Zomboss's Revenge. After being played once, they become available directly from the main menu.<br><br>The game has three gameplay modes. In the main adventure mode, levels get progressively more difficult, and at the end of each one the player receives a new plant for the arsenal. Puzzle mode has two variations: "Vasebreaker", where the goal is to break the vases scattered on the lawn, to uncover plants or zombies and use the former to fight the latter, and "I, Zombie", where the player controls the zombies against the plants. In survival mode, the zombies attack in turns. After each turn, the player can choose plants from the arsenal. There are three types of survival: normal (one wave per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, hard (two waves per turn, 5 turns) on each of the five maps, and endless (two waves per turn, endless amount of turns) on the pool map.<br><br>The Zen Garden stores all the available plants, where they have to be tended, watered, fertilized, sprayed for bugs and listen to music.

Description=Portal: Still Alive is the stand-alone Xbox 360 version of Portal with a few changes compared to the previous release of the game as a part of The Orange Box.<br><br>The quality of the graphics has been downsized to meet the restricted game size of Microsoft's XBLA service. In addition, fourteen more levels have been added based on the fan game Portal: The Flash Version, of which the levels were afterwards adapted to the 3D Source engine design of the original game. The new levels do not fit into the storyline and do not involve GladOS as an omniscient companion. That extra content was made available to the owners of the original Windows game for free. This version also includes developers' commentary.

Description=When Tommy, a garage mechanic, defends his girlfriend in a bar fight in a Native American reservation in Oklahoma, the entire bar, along with everyone inside, is sucked into a shuttlecraft. They are transported into The Sphere, an enormous, organic alien ship. Tommy is set free by one of the denizens and his task is to save his girlfriend Jen and grandfather Enisi, and find out what the meaning of The Sphere is.<br><br>This 3D-shooter, based on a modified version of the Doom 3 engine, takes place entirely inside the gigantic ship. As a combination of organic and cybernetic structures, gravity is defied: with the proper grids activated, you can walk on walls and ceilings. There are also multiple dimensions inside the ship you can cross using portals. During his quest, Tommy struggles with his Native American lineage. The ghost-like hawk Talon is always on your side and you sometimes cross over to another land to get help from your grandfather. Tommy can also shift to Spirit Walk, an alternate dimension in the game to get past obstacles and solve puzzles. When you die, you are also transported to another realm where you have to shoot lost souls with your spirit bow before being sent back. Your new health and spirit status will be based on your performance there.<br><br>The weapons Tommy uses are usually organic, with secondary fire functions. The arsenal includes a wrench, a rifle, crawlers, an acid sprayer, an auto cannon, a leech gun (chargeable with fire, ice, red orbs or lightning), a rocket launcher and the spirit bow. Certain parts of the game require you to explore large areas in a flying pod. You can use it to engage enemies or use the tractor beam to move objects. Navigation, often with a distinct lack of direction, is reminiscent of Descent then. Puzzles usually require you to decipher codes, activate switches and find entrances.<br><br>The game supports OpenAL and EAX HD surround sound, and multiplayer games for up to eight players in duel or team deathmatch. Although the game is developed by Human Head Studios, it is produced and was originally designed by 3D Realms.

Description=Prince of Persia once again resets the timeline of the series and marks the start of a new trilogy with the Prince on the search for Farah, his donkey, which is loaded with treasures beyond imagining. But after an sandstorm he falls down into a canyon and meets Elika, a princess with magical powers. She's being hunted by the army of her father and has to make her way to the temple beneath the tree of life.<br><br>But they come too late. After a brief fight against her father, he breaks the seal and by doing so unlocks the prison chamber that was kept closed by the powers of the Tree of Life. The inhabitant of that prison? Ahriman - God of Darkness. Creator of the darkness of space and the first to unleash envy and hate. Back in the days he was not satisfied with keeping only one half of the universe and after a fierce battle against his brother Ormazd, God of Light, he almost won. In a last attempt Ormazd successfully lured Ahriman into the Tree of Life, condemning him to a thousand years of pain. But Ahriman was only waiting. Waiting and planning and now that he is free, he and his minions are beginning to claim back what they lost and the only two people on the world to stop them are the Prince and Elika.<br><br>The basic gameplay remains the same as in the previous trilogy with the Prince engaging in sword fighting, wall climbing, spike dodging, puzzle solving, and more, in his quest to save the world. But opposed to the previous trilogy, the Prince neither can rewind time nor has to fight multiple enemies at a time. Instead he and Elika only face one, strong enemy every time and if the Prince is about to die because of a miscalculated jump or anyhing similar, she uses her powers and sets the Prince back to the beginning of the jumping puzzle. That is not the only thing she does. By command of the player, she also helps in fights, allows him to jump further distances by giving him a little push in the back in mid-air and shows which way to go next. Elika is also the key to bring the Tree of Life back to full strength. But to do so, she needs so-called "Seeds of Life" that are scattered all around the levels. If the player has collected enough of these, Elika will also become stronger.<br><br>Besides the enemies being stronger, more intelligent and having more special abilities, the fights play similar to the previous iterations of the series with the Prince slashing away at enemies with his sword or his gauntlet in to produce powerful combos. The gauntlet also allows the prince to slide down from solid rocks safely to the area below. The game features Quick Time Events when an enemy got a hold on the Prince and uses a cel-shaded and heavily stylized look for the characters.

Description=It was just going to be a social visit. The Prince of Persia just wanted to say "hi" to his older brother, Prince Malik who is the current ruler of the kingdom. Upon his arrival however he learns that he's not the only visitor: the whole Osman's army is at the castle's doorsteps and Malik's army can't hold the fort much longer. The Prince manages to find his way into the castle and meet up with Malik in the treasury. But it's already too late. The Osmans have broken through and the end seems near. In his desperation Malik turns to the sealed portal in the treasury and speaks the magic words. Bad idea. The portal was sealed for a reason, keeping a force imprisoned that is no match for any army in the world. Rumoured to have been the knights of King Salomon himself they walk upon the earth once more, storm the castle and attack friends and foes alike. Upon his escape, the Prince wanders into the realm of Razia, Queen of the Djinn. She remembers the creation of the Sand Army and knows how to keep it at bay. So the Prince joins forces with her and tries to find a way to defeat the army and keep the Kingdom from being swallowed by the sand.<br><br>With Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands the series returns in graphical style - being more down to earth again -, story and gameplay to the one known from the Sands of Time-Trilogy after its brief departure with the  cel-shaded-adventure Prince of Persia. As such the story takes place between the events in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Prince of Persia: Warrior Within filling in some of the blanks while the player looks the Prince over the shoulder and maneuvers him through the levels. Gameplay-wise this means that the player again fights multiple enemies at once and also again jumps, climbs and rolls around in big and vast rooms to get to the other side. To be able to do so, the Prince still knows how to walk on walls, swing on rails or rip through flags to safely get back to ground level. If something goes wrong, the player can only use the Power of Time to rewind a bit and try it again as long as he has enough sand left which in turn is dropped by killed enemies and by destroying scenery objects meaning mostly vases.<br><br>To deal with the hordes and hordes of different enemies - most of them undead -, the player has access to several different kinds of more or less dangerous attacks which he can string together into powerful combos. This includes kicking and jumping around as well as a death attack which instantly kills enemies fallen to the ground. In addition, the player will gain access to special powers. As he collects the essence from fallen enemies he earns experience points for doing so, levels up and gets upgrade points which in turn are invested into a skill tree to unlock new or upgrade existing powers. Besides the power to rewind time, the Prince is able to freeze water, rebuild destroyed parts of the city or engulf himself in an armor of stone. Each of these powers is active until the energy-bar of the Prince drops to zero. Again killing enemies is they key to replenish it.

His mission is to get into Fox River prison and report to the company about Michael's attempts to escape with his brother. The original story serves therefore as a background for Paxton's experiences in the prison.<br><br>Prison Break: The Conspiracy is essentially a stealth game with hand-to-hand combat portions. Most of the game is composed of objectives given to Paxton by other inmates. These objectives, for the most part, involve sneaking past security guards, janitors, or hostile inmates, staying unnoticed at all times. If the protagonist is spotted, the player returns to the previous check-point and has to play the part of the sequence again. If the hostile character is an inmate, it is possible to fight him.<br><br>There are also other activities the protagonist can engage in when not being on a mission, such as lifting weights, getting tattoos, and fighting other inmates for money and other prizes.

The game's story takes place in the year 2632, five hundred years after humanity left the solar system. Under Earth's rule, 11 different star systems have now been terraformed and colonized. However, there are a number of groups who object to Earth's rule and desire independence; four of them have joined forces and formed a rebel group called the ADAN Freedom Alliance. The main characters in the story are Katana Faraway, Ellen Bernstein, and Margras Mason; all are young pilots having just joined the Earth's military, the Terra Central Armed Forces (TCAF). Following a suspicious accident, Margras joins the opposing ADAN forces to fight against his former friends and home planet.  You control Katana in the game, and as missions are completed the story progresses.<br><br>While previous Silpheed games utilized a top down view of the action, Project Sylpheed features a fully 3-D view from either just behind your ship, or a first person view from within it.

Description=Alex Mercer has a problem or a gift - depending on the view. Thanks to a virus in his system he has several deadly powers and can change his appearance into any person he consumes which basically means the same thing as brutally killing the person he wants to be. Of course Alex didn't voluntarily get this "enhancement". Instead he was part of a genetic experiment at a company called Genetek. Having lost his memory about what exactly happened, he is now both looking for vengeance as well as his past. The second specimen, Elizabeth Green, on the other hand meanwhile infects more and more parts of Manhattan Island with a transmutation of the virus which converts people either into mindless zombies or brutal monsters.<br><br>Prototype is an open-world game similar to Grand Theft Auto IV where the player controls Alex through a 3rd-person-view. He is able to freely roam about Manhattan Island with iconic scenery like Central Park and Times Square. But instead of stealing cars and mugging old ladies, Alex feels more like going the Spider-Man route. By sprinting against a wall, he is able to climb and jump up to the roof fast. Thanks to his supernatural jump ability and his invulnerability to falling damage, he can then traverse the city from above instead of making his way through rush hour. Of course monsters like hunters as well as the military have the means to reach him even up there. To defend himself, Alex has several powers at his disposal. He can lift heavy objects and throw them at enemies, making it easy to take down even a full-blown helicopter. He also has the already mentioned ability to shape shift into any person he manages to grab and consume. When done without being seen, it removes the heat from Alex and will, just as hiding does, eventually put his human pursuers back to sleep. The monsters on the other hand will keep at him. It also enables him to enter areas he couldnt access before. Other powers include claws, a shield, fists like boulders that make for a good punch and powerful lash. At any time Alex can only use one of those powers and he has to unlock them first. This is done by investing the evolution points he gains for killing enemies and fulfilling objectives into upgrades.<br><br>Divided into several categories, these upgrades increase for example his sprint speed, give him new abilities like said powers or enable him to do new moves like gliding through the air instead of just falling straight down. In addition some abilities like driving a tank or improving his ability to handle normal weapons can only be learned by consuming specific persons marked with a symbol over their head. This is also necessary to replenish his health and to uncover the Web of Intrigue. The Web of Intrigue fills in the blanks on Alexs background and what happened to him at Genetek. Some pedestrians, military personal or police had more or less direct contact with Alex or the project he was part on and if he finds and consumes them, a short cutscene shows what he learns from that person. To keep an overview of his progress, the player can access a detailed map from the menu. There he can not only rewatch every movie but can also see what information connects with others, giving the player an understanding how every piece of the puzzle is connected.<br><br>If the player isnt doing the missions of the main storyline or destroying military bases or hives, he can find several different kinds of mini-games in the city. Ranging from kill/consume missions and waypoint races over the roof tops to fighting small skirmishes on either the side of the military or the infected. In any case the player gains additional evolution points depending how well he did. These mini-games are unlocked by progressing through the story line as well as by getting a gold medal in a mini-game. Another past-time that grants evolution points is the search for landmarks and hints hidden around the island. The more the player collects of these, the more evolution points he gets for it.

Description=Pure puts the player behind the handlebars of an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) - better known as a Quad Bike, but instead of just choosing one from a pre-existing ensemble, he has to build his Quad Bikes from scratch himself.<br><br>From the suspension over the engine to the form and color of the handle bars, he has many options to choose from. By playing through the heart of the game, the World Tour single player campaign, he unlocks additional parts by winning the events and collecting the flag hidden on the track. Some parts are purely cosmetically and don't change the stats of the bike but others have a great impact and come in a freestyle or race version. Deciding on which to use greatly influences how the Quad Bike behaves in terms of speed or how easy the player can perform tricks on it. Since the player also unlocks additional room in his garage, he can build the perfect Quad Bike for every one of the available game modes (Race, Sprint, Freestyle). This is especially important once the race has started because of the way how boost is handled.<br><br>Each trick the player makes gives him more or less boost, depending on how good it was and such factors. That boost can then be used to give your Quad Bike a temporary speed advantage. But at the same time the amount of boost the player has collected, defines which tricks can be performed. At the beginning of the race, only basic tricks are available to the driver and as he gains boost, he first unlocks advanced and then professional tricks. So the player hast to decide if he wants to be able to perform more difficult tricks, and gain more boost with one trick, or if he will sacrifice this ability for a short speed advantage.<br><br>While the game modes race and sprint are just races where the one wins, who is on the first position at the end, in freestyle the place doesn't matter. Instead the player needs to perform tricks to gain points. Once a trick has been successfully pulled off, a timer starts and when the player performs another trick before it runs out, the multiplicator goes up. There are also power-ups scattered around the map which allow the player to perform a special trick, double his points or refuel him a little. Especially the last one is important since the race goes on until the player runs out of fuel. Once everyone is out of fuel, the one with the most points wins.

In this RPG hybrid you'll be following the story of your character as they rid Etheria of the Undead scourge and save Bartonia, complete sidequests for extra money, experience, items and companions, craft your own weapons and armor, capture monsters for use as mounts or to learn their spells, and even lay siege to neighboring kingdoms in order to add them to your own empire. However, Puzzle Quest is an RPG with a twist. Everything is done (as the name implies) with puzzles.<br><br>Everything in Puzzle Quest is done with puzzles. The puzzles themselves are similar to Bejeweled in execution, with a few slight variations used for things like item crafting and enemy capture.<br><br>When fighting an enemy (which can range from zombies to orcs and even castle strongholds, each with their own special spells and abilities), you both take turns using the same board. The goal is to reduce your opponents hitpoints to zero, which can be done directly by linking up skulls in rows of three or more, or by using spells which require mana. To build up mana, just link three or more runes of the same color together, just like the skulls. Every time you gain mana, it's stored in your reserves until you use it (or are hit with a mana draining attack). Gold and experience are built up in the same way, using gold coins or purple experience orbs that occupy the same board and can be linked just like runes and skulls.<br><br>The real strategy behind the game comes into play when you factor in elemental mastery (gaining extra mana when linking runes for a specific element), equipment (which can prevent damage, drain mana and more), spells (which can poison, drain mana, stun and so on) and linking up groups of four or more. The reason groups of four are important is that every time a row of four-of-a-kind is created, you get an extra turn. While it doesn't sound important, getting four runes in a row could possibly give you enough mana to cast an extremely powerful spell and give you the extra turn to cast it before your enemy can even move.<br><br>There is also a direct action mode in which players can hone their skills against various opponents independent from the story mode, as well as wireless multi-card play where two players can square off using their own characters from the campaign mode.

Description=Quake 4 is the true sequel to Quake II, continuing the Strogg vs. Humans storyline from the point where Quake II ended. The Strogg is an alien cyborg race which, much like the Star Trek Borg race from which they seem to be partly inspired, wander the galaxy conquering planets and wiping civilizations. Their sole purpose is to collect organic body parts with which to swell their ranks. After a prolonged war, the united armed forces of Earth decided to launch a desperate counter attack on the home planet of the invaders, Stroggos. By some twist of fate a sole marine was able to disable the Strogg main planetary defense (aka The Big Gun) and kill Makron, their leader. That was the end of Quake II. The second wave of attack is meant to land on Stroggos and take advantage of the brief disorder, ending the threat of the Strogg forever. Of course it will not be that easy...<br><br>This time the lone soldier theme (of Quake I, II and the Doom series) is replaced by a war. Not as large scale as a military FPS or even Halo, but close enough. There are squad mates, some of which are important to protect, some vehicles (a hovertank and a mech) and frequently changing objectives to achieve. The arsenal contains elements from all Quake games (nailgun, rail gun, lightning gun) and the classic BFG has been replaced by the Dark Matter Gun. Weapons can be improved later in the game, making them much more effective. The game uses a somewhat improved version of the Doom 3 engine to good effect. Multiplayer options are rather limited, offering only the standard Deathmatch modes and CTF.<br><br>Quake 4 was developed by Raven under the guidance of id Software.

Description=Red Dead Redemption is a free-roaming western game and the spiritual successor to Red Dead Revolver. The game is set in 1911, where players take control of John Marston; an outlaw who is forced to turn on his peers when federal agents threaten his family. He is sent to the American frontier to capture his former gang members, especially the notorious leader Bill Williamson.<br><br>In the open world, the player is free to pursue to the storyline or to partake in the various events that occur while exploring the West; similar in overall design to Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series. Horses are the main means of transportation, and the player can whistle for their mount at any time. Players can also visit towns, talk to other characters, and join or intervene in events such as public hangings, ambushes and robberies. Many of these are random, including dangerous animal attacks and bandit ambushes. Other activities include hunting, gambling, duels and standoffs, with guns as the main weapon. <br><br>Based on the player's decisions, two morality systems (honor and fame) influence on how the environment and other characters react to Marston. Marston can shoot while riding a horse and capture people by lasso, combined with a cover system with specific targeting or wildfire. In the recharging Dead Eye targeting mode time is slowed down to target different enemies in specific locations, and then execute the shots in rapid succession. The player can also set up camps anywhere in the world to fast travel to known locations or save their game.<br><br>Multiplayer is supported through free-for-all, team and capture-the-flag modes, introducing crates with weapons and power-ups. Games start with a Mexican standoff where the survivor receives some extra time to gather items while the others are respawning, Similar to Grand Theft Auto IV there is a continuous free-roaming mode where players can team up in posses to form a party to engage computer-controlled gangs. Posses are made up of a maximum of eight players and all multiplayer games support a maximum of sixteen players. During multiplayer the characters can level up and gain access to new mount breeds, character models and weapon skins.

Description=Red Faction: Guerrilla is the third entry of the Red Faction series and deviates from the first-person shooter genre that the previous two incarnations featured and incorporates an open world sandbox environment similar to Mercenaries, Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row ( which the developer, Volition, has also developed).<br><br>Set 50 years after the events of the first two games, Mars has been liberated from the devious Ultor Corporation by Red Faction and the E.D.F. (Earth Defense Force) has stepped in to help the Miner Community get back on their feet.  However, the E.D.F. has become an occupying force, taking over the planet, executing citizens and imposing martial law on the planet.  As a result a new Red Faction element has been formed to fight the E.D.F. and once again bring peace and freedom to the Martian landscape.  The player takes control of Alec Mason, a recently arrived dissident of Earth hoping to make his new life on Mars with his brother Dan, only to be swept up in the Revolution and free Mars five sectors (Parker, the Badlands, Oasis, the Free Fire Zone and Eos) from E.D.F. control.  To do this the player must complete missions and destroy E.D.F. vehicles and property, lowering their control on each sector and raising the morale of the resident population.<br><br>The missions range from story missions which purpose is to further advance the story and other missions including Transporter (returning certain vehicles to a safehouse in a certain amount of time), Guerrilla Raid (where the player and a group of Rebels attack and E.D.F. building and destroying it), Heavy Metal (where the player provides a distraction which allows fellow rebels to complete another mission without alarming the E.D.F.), Demolition Master (which the player has to destroy a target within a certain time limit and a limited supply of ammo) and House Arrest (where the player must rescue hostages and return them to a safehouse).<br><br>There are also missions that pop-up from time to time including Courier (where the player must track down and kill an enemy spy to collect the information he is carrying), Assault (where the player must defend a certain target against incoming E.D.F. forces) and Convoy (where the player must either destroy a line of vehicles or capture a target vehicle and return it to a safehouse).  Completing these missions will drop enemy control of the area, raise morale of the citizens, be awarded scrap and unlock more advanced weapons.  To liberate each section the player must drop the E.D.F. control of the area to zero and complete the story missions, once the player meets this a final story mission will be unlocked which will liberate that sector and unlock story missions for the next.<br><br>Players have a variety of vehicles to choose from, ranging from cars to trucks, dune buggys and dump trucks and even tanks and APC's (Armored Personal Carriers).  There is also a plethora of weapons including pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, the sledgehammer (the players main weapon which can't be removed), remote mines, anti-personal mines, rocket launchers and the dreaded Nano Rifle (which fires a stream of nanobots that can disintegrate targets within an instant).  The player can carry four different weapons at a time and can swap them out through access at their safehouses or through ammo boxes littered throughout the landscape.  The most advanced weapons such as the Nano Rifle is only unlocked through the story missions while some can be found in E.D.F. buildings (like the Singularity Mine) and each weapon can be upgraded through safehouses which include extra ammo and more firepower through scrap.  Scrap is the game's currency which is obtained through completing missions or destroying E.D.F. buildings and vehicles.<br><br>The game also has an updated Geo-Mod 2.0 game engine which allows the player to virtually destroy a building realistically such as making it lean left by blowing up the left side of the structure or lean forward if the front is blown apart.  Players can use this to their advantage against enemies such as destroying the building from the ground floor, toppling it on enemies and vehicles or destroying the support structures of bridges with explosives, causing it to collapse with a convoy of enemies on top.  It also features the physics engine, Havok for the character physics.<br><br>There is also an offline two-player mode called Wrecking Crew where two friends take turns on four different modes such as Barrel Dash, Total Chaos, Rampage and Escalation and play a certain set of rounds to win an event.  Online multiplayer games are present as well including Anarchy, Team Anarchy, Capture the Flag, Damage Control, Siege and Demolition which awards players experience points that they can use to customize their online players and acquire more advanced weaponry.  Additionally, there are backpacks for the Wrecking Crew and Multiplayer modes which enhances the players abilities such as Jetpacks, Stealth, Vision (essentially an X-ray) and more power-based ones such as Concussion, which will knock over nearby enemy players and Tremor, which can damage enemies as well as structures.

The story takes place several years before the events of RF:G and takes place in the Mariner Valley of Mars, the home of the Marauders.<br><br>The Marauders are a group of people that are considered "savages" to the civilized inhabitants of Mars, but in fact they are descendants of the first Red Faction conflict years ago with the Ultor Corporation who has decided to live a more basic, primitive life, but still continuing the research into new technology.  For years the Marauders and have lived in secret away from the general population on Mars in peace until one day the E.D.F. (Earth Defense Force) shows up at the valley.<br><br>In an attempt to tighten their grip for control of Mars, the E.D.F. sweeps into the Mariner Valley and begins to systematically eliminate Marauder homes and families to take control of the valley and develop a new base of operations while wiping out any future threats.  In this chaos, the player's character is introduced, a Marauder by the name of Samanya whose family was slaughtered by the E.D.F. and has sworn revenge.  She then leads the Marauders against the E.D.F. in an attempt to bring back peace to their valley and hopefully drive them off the face of Mars.<br><br>The gameplay is virtually identical, with the same controls and weapons setups, the player will start out with hammer (similar to Alec Mason) which they cannot discard, but can pick up more powerful weapons such as remote mine charges, shotguns, machine guns all of which are designed in different fashions to the original versions in RF:G along with newer weapons are Marauder vehicles and walkers.<br><br>The objective is also similar, by completing both side missions and main story missions to bring down E.D.F. control of certain areas in order to advance and also destroying E.D.F. buildings and targets as well and can also unlock new weapons by completing missions.  The game, however, cannot cross into the original Red Faction: Guerrilla and has no new content for any multiplayer modes.

Soon they are attacked by hordes of locals infected by an improved version of the "las plagas" parasite seen in Resident Evil 4, which they call "majini". As the story progresses, Chris discovers that some old fellows are behind the whole incident.<br><br>As well as including the concept of the "las plagas" parasite, this fifth part of the series also brings back the novel gameplay from the previous game. With an over the shoulder view, Chris confronts hordes of infected enemies that can throw objects and even shoot at you. They can be repelled with various guns, grenades, or using the knife and melee attacks if they get too close. This time though, Chris has a partner, Sheva, who accompanies him through all the game and can be controlled by a second player, with both characters having to keep an eye on each other to survive. The second player can enter and leave at any time playing locally through split screen or online through another console.<br><br>The mercenaries mode, which consists of closed levels where the player must survive a given time while defeating enemies to set up chains and earn points, also returns from Resident Evil 4.

Description=Resonance of Fate is a role-playing game from tri-Ace that takes place in the future when the Earth becomes too poisonous to live on and humanity moves to the machine-city of Basel. It is a city built high up to the sky upon a tower-like structure. The story of the game focuses on Vashyron, who is the leader of the PMF (Private Military Firm), as well as two other characters named Zephyr and Leanne, who join Vashyon's group and take on missions from the citizens of Basel. <br><br>Combat in Resonance of Fate is done through a unique turn-based system dubbed tri-Attack-Battle (t-A-B). Movement, charging, and attacks are done using the action gauge until a character's turn is over. However, enemies still attack in real time while the player is performing actions. Before attacking an enemy the player needs to build up their charge, which builds up fast if a character is closer to the enemy. Attacks in battle require at least one full charge to be successful and either deal non-permanent scratch damage with machine guns and rapid fire weapons or permanent direct damage with handguns and grenades. Dealing direct damage also makes scratch damage permanent. Once an attack is completed the character's turn is over, so it is up to the player to use their characters to deal both types of damage timely and effectively against enemies.<br><br>Special attacks in the game are presented in the form of Hero Actions where a character can be sent down a path shooting multiple times and multiple enemies while invincible to enemy attacks. Hero Actions cost Bezels and once they are depleted the player enters Critical Condition in which they cannot use items and both their attack and accuracy are greatly reduced, however Bezels can be recovered by destroying an enemy's body part or defeating it entirely. Hero Actions can also built up to another type of special attack called a Tri-Attack  where all three characters will attack at once, but it can only be perform once certain conditions are met.

When the dark wave hits, the humans are on their own and only a few enclaves survive the attack. One is a volcano-island which has been saved from the worst by an unknown force but its protection is getting weaker and weaker.<br><br>The player arrives on the island after his ship is hit and destroyed by the dark wave and finds himself in an open world filled with dangerous creatures, many different characters and three factions and will unlock the secret of the island during the course of the game. <br><br>Although the game is called Risen, it plays very similar to Gothic 2 and Gothic which means the player once again takes over the control of a nameless hero from a 3rd-person-view and will be exploring the island, talking to people in multiple-choice-dialogues, fulfilling quests and fighting monsters and other enemies while using the experience points earned to level up and learn new skills and abilities in a typical role-playing-game-fashion. Depending on which of the three factions (bandits, mages or inquisitors) the player joins by earning their respect through fulfilling quests, he also chooses to a certain degree what he wants to be although he is always able to distribute his skill points into anything he likes - as long as he finds a teacher for that particular skill.<br><br>Combat against the many enemies ranging from gnomes to powerful ash-beasts requires the player not only to invest points into his combat-skills, but also to master blocking and dodging enemy attacks while on the other hand get through the enemy defense. If a parry is activated at the right moment it is even possible to land an immediate counter-attack.

Description=Iolcos is a small island in the Aegean. Protected by those who worship Zeus, it is a idyllic place with not much to worry about. At least until the wedding day of King Jason and his future Queen Alcmene for which many dignitaries from all over the world arrived - including Jason's longtime friend Hercules. But instead of celebrating the event with them, the Moriens had other plans, attacked the palace and killed Alcmene during the ceremony. Now Jason is really pissed and wants revenge. But the journey is long and at the end he has to face a dark prophecy.<br><br>The player slips into the sandals of Jason and watches over his back and controls him in a traditional Action-Adventure fashion similar to games like Rune (only without the jumping) as he roams the lands, speaks to the inhabitants and fulfills their requests while always having his main goal in mind. Of course Jason isn't just all about walk and talk. He has many enemies that want his death but three different types of weapons (swords, maces and spears) as well as his trusty shield assure that he can defend himself. Jason can switch with one button press quickly between all weapons, allowing him to do powerful combos by combining both the normal attack with the stronger, more brutal, executioner move and some of them have special abilities like knocking down all of the surrounding enemies which are activated by a two-button combination.<br><br>But Jason also has many friends. Besides Hercules other mythical heroes will join him on his journey and aid him in battle. They will also gain strength if Jason is near them and unleash powerful special abilities. If a companion dies, Jason can resurrect him and if Jason is too badly damaged, he just needs to get out of the line of fire for a few seconds to regenerate.<br><br>Jason also doesn't completely rely on his muscles but is in addition aided by the four gods: Apollo, Athene, Ares and Hermes. Each god gives Jason access to a different skill tree with many different types of buffs and abilities waiting to be unlocked. This is done two ways: One way to gain favor with the gods is by talking to people and choosing the corresponding responses for the god whose favor the player seeks. But at the same time Jason more or less automatically performs deeds like killing 35 people (Manslayer IV) during his journey which he can then attribute to a god of his choosing. Once a certain amount of favor amount has been acquired, an aspect point becomes available to distribute in the skill tree of that particular god.

Description=Risk: Factions is an electronic variant of the Hasbro strategy board game Risk, but it has been streamlined from the board game version to speed up gameplay. The gameplay is based on the boardgame's 2008 set of rules, and also adds overkill (more damage when rolling two or three 6s - two removes four units, three removes them all), specific faction abilities (to use a fourth die in certain circumstances), and dynamic terrain to the rules.<br><br>The game is based on each player controlling a different section of board, and attacking an enemy's territory as well as defending his own. The original board game is won by whoever takes over the entire map first. Conflicts are resolved by each player taking a turn to roll the dice based, reducing the opponent's strength with each roll. Whoever has units standing at the end of the conflict gets to occupy the territory. However, in Risk: Factions, the single player game is won by the person who completes three objectives and controls his capital at the end of the game. Objectives include having to take certain territories and capturing a certain amount of power plants. This mode of play is dubbed the Command Room. For conquered territory players receive stars (cards in the original game) that can be traded in for new troops at the next turn. No more than two stars can be collected per turn.<br><br>The original board game version is also available to play as Classic Risk. Players can control one of five different factions: the Humans, Robots, Cats, Zombies and the Yeti, each with their own unique leader. The singleplayer is divided into five different chapter and each one unlocks a new faction. Playable maps include the original map from the board game, as well as several new ones designed for Factions. The game comes with both online and offline multiplayer support. Online, you can team up with up to four other people for a five-player game. Offline, you can play in a four-player game, in co-op, or play on your own against other people, again using the original Risk rules or the new Command Room style.

Description=The Bourne Conspiracy is a 3rd person fast-paced action game, mixing shooting, a little bit of driving (one level), and hand-to-hand combat. The player controls Jason Bourne, an assassin trying to uncover his past after being injured and losing his memory in a failed mission near Marseille, and now wanted dead by his former employers.<br><br>A key component is the "Bourne Instinct" feature, which enables him to recognize threats and objectives, and perform devastating takedown moves using the environment. When you successfully shoot enemies, throw punches and kicks against your opponents, or break destructible objects with your car, an adrenaline meter fills in; as soon as one of the three segments is filled, you can issue a one-button takedown and get rid of one of your foes, or decide to wait until you accumulate multiple segments to neutralize several opponents at once. In the driving level, the Bourne Instinct is used to slow down the action for a few seconds, allowing you to avoid traffic more easily.<br><br>The combat system works in the following way: one button triggers a light attack, another button throws a heavier attack, and a third one is used to block. Mixing up the first two button presses allows to make eight different combos. Sometimes, in the middle of a fight, a sound will warn that the opponent is about to perform a takedown: the player then only has a couple of seconds to press the button corresponding to a flashing indication on the screen, and counter the move. These quicktime events are also present in a number of interactive cutscenes, where the proper buttons need to be hit within the correct timeframe or the mission will fail.<br><br>Some missions take to the action seen in The Bourne Identity movie (such as the escape from the Zurich embassy, or the Paris car chase in Marie's Mini), while others are flashbacks featuring Bourne at the time he was a cold blooded assassin working for Treadstone. In most levels, there are passports lying around, and collecting them all will unlock the bonus features: some concept art, music tracks, as well as an opportunity to replay the cinematics and boss battles directly from the main menu.

Description=In this action-adventure powered by the Unreal Engine 3, you play as a robot named Blitz whose space station has come under attack from the dreaded megaNOED. You will have to travel to six non-linear different areas of the station (from the armory to the radar station to the cooling towers) each with three levels in order to power up the massive Space Cannon and vanquish the invaders.  A final level will appear once these are all complete.  <br><br>Along the way, you must dispatch many different enemies including arm-twirling nuisance bots, flying wheels of death and even smiling, spherical miniNOEDs. There's both ground and air-based robots plus a series of boss battles at the end of every hub. While most enemies can be shot and destroyed, there are others where you must use the environment around them as well as physics-based gameplay (powered by Ageia's PhysX) to outsmart them like using barrels to crush enemies or lure them into dangerous areas.  You'll discover a friend in the station's depths who will provide you with an assortment of new upgrades. Some can be bought by collecting green cards called Upgradium throughout the levels. Others will be given to you if they are essential to completing an area. <br><br>You start out with basic rocket launchers and energy guns, but later you'll acquire a hovergun that will cause whatever it hits to float up in the air, and a point-to-point gun which binds two separate objects together with an energy beam. There are puzzles throughout which need to be solved in order to power up the cannon, some as easy as the "push button" variety while others involve switching the laser paths with prisms to open doors or putting metal objects in a shredder to make a shell for the cannon. Some can have multiple solutions depending on your own inventiveness.<br><br>The Xbox Live version of the game uses Allegorithmic's ProFX procedural texturing tool in order to reduce the game size small enough for the service.  An earlier version of the game called RoboHordes was made as a tech demo in 2005 for the Intel dual core processor as a single-level game that featured entirely physics-driven game play.

Description=Rock Band, by the original developers behind the Guitar Hero games, takes the concept a step further. Instead of solely playing the guitar along with songs, this game allows players to start a full virtual band with up to four players, with different sequences for each of the three supported peripherals: guitar (electric and bass), drum and microphone. Gameplay is based on hitting scrolling notes on the screen in time (scrolling vertically for drum and guitar), and getting the right pitch for the vocals (scrolling horizontally at the top of the screen, along with the lyrics).<br><br>The game offers a Solo Tour Mode for a single player or a Band World Tour (as well as Quick Play) for two to four players. By doing well players earn cash to customize the characters in the Rock Shop, with tattoos, face paint, clothing and logos. Customized characters are automatically locked to an instrument. Other customizations include movements on stage, instruments, and the general physique and appearance in the game. To succeed, players need to reach a set score through their combined performances. Multipliers for playing perfectly are tracked for the individual instruments and there can also be separate difficulty levels. The Star Power from the Guitar Hero series has been replaced by Overdrive, a meter filled by not making any mistakes in certain sections of a song. In band play using Overdrive also increases the band's score multiplier.<br><br>Players who fail during the song are locked out and the audio mix takes over. Other band members can revive the player by using their Overdrive. Failed players will however drag down the band's overall performance, so it becomes important to bring back band members. Next to the Overdrive sections, there are also Union Phrases (score bonus and extra Overdrive) and sometimes Big Rock Endings at the end of a song where another bonus can be gained.<br><br>In the Tour Mode players visit 41 venues in seventeen different cities. After the initial venues, others need a certain numbers of fans to be unlocked and certain continents only become available when tour buses or private jets are acquired. Not every venue comes with a set list of tracks. They consists of single tracks, multiple tracks, custom setlists or mystery setlists. Performing poorly can also have the band lose fans. Extra competition is included to attract managers, roadies and deals with record labels. <br><br>Next to the main modes there is also a versus mode for the individual instruments (Tug of War), Score Duel (get the most points) and a Tutorial mode. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions feature multiplayer games with new songs through downloadable content.<br><br>The European version is not sold as a single package. Instead, there is an instruments package and the game is sold separately, for a much higher price than the original US release.

Directly competing with Guitar Hero: World Tour, the game allows different people to play together as in a band, with the same peripherals as the first game: lead guitar, bass guitar, microphone and a drum set.<br><br>The new drum and guitar controllers for this version, bundled or sold separately, have been revised and older controllers are also supported. The guitar controller, modelled after the Fender Stratocaster, has five additional fret buttons near the neck, for fast fingertapping sessions. There is also an effect switch to toggle between five different effects. Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.<br><br>The original game's Solo Tour mode and the multiplayer Band World Tour mode have been merged into a single Tour mode where up to four players can cooperate, both local and online (PS3/Xbox 360). Band leaders are no longer necessary and instruments can be swapped at will. From this mode, three options are available: Start Tour (regular tour mode), Tour Challenge (different challenges), and Battle of the Bands (compete against other bands online through score tracking - not on the PS2). The game includes a training mode for the different instruments, as well as a freestyle mode for drummers where they can drum along with custom mp3 files (Xbox 360/PS3). Other modes and modifiers for the regular game modes can be selected from an Extras menu.<br><br>The in-game characters can also be customized and 84 tracks are included on the disc, with many more as downloadable content (not on the PS2).

Description=Rock Band 3 is the third game in the main Rock Band series, and features numerous new additions to the original game.  As with previous games in the series, players form a band (of up to seven players) and perform a song together using guitar, bass, drums, vocals (solo or harmonies) and new to this game, keyboard.  By working together, players can maximise their scores.  Each player can fill a power bar by performing special sets of notes.  When they have enough of these, they can activate "Overdrive" which adds a x2 multiplier for each player that has Overdrive activated simultaneously (so, for example, having four players with Overdrive activate will score you x8 rather than x2 for only one person).<br><br>Vocal harmonies, first introduced in The Beatles: Rock Band, are carried over into the main Rock Band series for the first time.  Up to three players can perform on the microphone, with one player performing the lead, and the remaining players performing backing vocals.  By keeping in harmony with each other, players can earn double or triple score, depending on how many players can keep up.  The game also introduces a new style of play for each of the instruments, "Pro Mode".  Pro Mode is more accurate to actual instruments for those players who are looking for an even greater challenge - guitars have multiple buttons on the fret board and players must actually strum strings, the drums must have the three cymbal attachment, while with the keyboard, even more keys are used so that the performance is much closer to actual play.<br><br>The Career Mode of the game has also been revised for this game.  Rather than grinding to earn money to unlock new items, the game is instead based around Achievement-like "goals".  Each goal you unlock earns you more fans for your band, and often unlocks new items of clothing or instruments.  All songs are initially unlocked so that those who just want to play for fun can, while those looking for a deeper experience can tackle the "Road Challenge" mode, which has you travelling to different venues and performing song sets.  Each star you earn for a song gets transformed into "Spades" at the end of the performance, and the more Spades you earn, the more goals you unlock which again translates into even more fans and items.  Bonus Spades can be earned by performing the requested tasks at the start of each song, such as continuously deploying Overdrive, performing note streaks while you're in the spotlight, or deploying Overdrive when full and then performing note streaks.

Description=Rocket Knight is a 2.5D platformer and a reboot of the Rocket Knight series from the nineties, with the titles Rocket Knight Adventures and Sparkster. Players control Sparkster, a jet pack-powered opossum through levels with different themes. The game is set in Ethorn, in the kingdom Zephyrus. Fifteen years after the events of the previous game Sparkster leads a quiet farming life with his wife and kid when the mountain wolves suddenly attack with warships. Sparkster once vowed to protect the kingdom at all costs, but was disappointed when the king made an alliance with the Devotindos of the Pig Empire, who once attacked the kingdom. Regardless of the decisions the king made in the past, Sparkster immediately equips his gear and once again will defend the kingdom. It also marks the return of his rivalry with Axel, who likes to hinder Sparkster's progress and attempts to take the credit for his victories.<br><br>Aside from the graphical overhaul Rocket Knight also borrows some gameplay elements from the previous games and expands upon them. Sparkster has a number of basic movement options that allow him to jump and glide on rails. Much more important is the rocket pack that allows him to burst into the air in different directions, ricocheting off walls and attacking at the same time. Using this depletes a burst meter that takes some time to refill, except for the ice levels where it can only be restored using power-ups or by standing next to fire. These rocket bursts are needed to move around the levels and in later parts of the game it requires precise timing to quickly travel between platforms. A rocket burst can also be complemented with a burst drill by double tapping, making Sparkster break through walls. Burst assist can be used to hover temporarily in the air.<br><br>Next to the basic attacks with his sword, Sparkster can use burst to engage enemies, using burst shot to launch a bolt of energy, burst vortex to whirl on the spot with his sword and rail spin to attack when hanging on a rail. Many objects can be destroyed and some enemy projectiles can be reflected. Most of the levels follow regular platform gameplay with checkpoints and level bosses, but there are also a number of flying levels where Sparkster flies permanently into the air at a fixed speed and the game is turned into a horizontally-scrolling shooter. One of the later levels also has a vertically-scrolling section in a chasm and these later levels also put much more focus on the platform element and quick reflexes rather instead of merely attacking enemies.<br><br>During the levels Sparkster can pick up hearts to restore energy, collect diamonds and extra lives. When all lives are used up, a number of continues are available, but at the cost of having to restart the level. The main Arcade mode follows the story and afterwards these levels become available in the Free Play mode. Similar to the older titles in the series Sparkster can unlock new outfits, such as Gold Sparkster and Axel's gear. High scores and completion times for both individual stages and full Arcade modes are ranked in global leaderboards.

However, a brilliant scientist discovers the secret to Blockbeard's mobility: a jetpack strapped to his bottom! And so now, you must venture forth with your very own butt-rocket in order to find Blockbeard and bring him to justice.<br><br>Rocket Riot is a twin-stick shooter that plays much like a cross between Geometry Wars and Worms, where players fly around a completely-destructible environment firing rockets at one another. A variety of items add spice to the action, including power-ups like giant rockets and rapid fire, defensive abilities like shields and reflectors, power-downs like one that makes your character move erratically as if drunk, and even some that just give silly effects like turning your rockets into random objects or making explosions big and colorful.<br><br>The game features a faux-retro art design where everything is made up of blocky pixels (which explode all over the screen in a wild fervor), virtually everything is a 2D object, and the soundtrack features retro-sounding chiptune pieces including a silly vocal theme song. There are 80+ stages and more than a hundred playable characters to unlock.<br><br>The game can be played solo, with up to four players local, or up to eight players via system link or Xbox Live. Most of the single player missions are standard deathmatch, but there are also other game modes such as: Rugby Riot, where one team tries to take a football from one end of the stage to a goal, while the other team tries to stop them; Golden Guy, where the goal is to hold the golden armor for the longest, but whoever has it can't shoot; and Destroy the Object, where each team has a big glowing object, and must protect it while trying to destroy the other team's big glowing object.

It stars Neil Patrick Harris and Felicia Day and includes several Rob Zombie and White Zombie songs, as well as Rob Zombie himself.<br><br>Like most on-rails games, it uses the familiar first-person perspective and guides the player throughout the environments.  There are two main ways of dealing with enemies.  The majority of the enemies use untimed measures.  There is a measure associated with each enemy.  Depending on the difficulty level, these measures can contain from one single note to a series of complex chords.  Players play the corresponding note sequence as quick as possible to defeat the enemy, though accuracy is also gauged.  Many mini-bosses and all bosses also use timed measures, which is similar to Guitar Hero where the player is playing a series of note-tracked notes along a scrolling measure.<br><br>There is a drop-in two player co-op mode.  Players can use two guitars, two drums or one of each.  This is a competitive co-op as each player has a separate score, and players can actually steal kills by completing untimed measures before the other player.  If one player is out of continues, the other player can donate unused continues to the fallen.

The game however takes place in North Korea and the UdSSR in 1986. In the role of Marcinko, the player has to retrieve intelligence on ballistic missile launchers. And although his squad-members get killed right after entering the mission area, Marcinko continues alone with the mission, eventually uncovering and eliminating a larger threat against the US.<br><br>The game is a first-person-shooter with a bit of stealth thrown into the mix. Looking through the eyes of Marcinko, the player can either sneak through the levels, using brutal kill moves or a silenced pistol to take out his enemies. Or he can run in guns blazing with the vast array of real-world-weaponry like the SPAS-12 shotgun or the AK-47 assault rifle although only two weapons can be carried at the same time. But since even Marcinko isn't invulnerable, simply storming in isn't always a good idea. To help the player from being hit, Marcinko can take cover behind objects. The camera then switches to a 3rd-person-shoulde-rview and allows the player to either blind fire or duck out of cover to shoot the targets.<br><br>The game also features a multiplayer-mode for up to eight players in either Deathmatch or Team-Deathmatch on maps inspired but not directly copied from the single-player-campaign.

Description=Sean Devlin is an Irish mechanic and a racer in Paris - or at least he was. One day in 1940, as he takes part in the Grand Prix of Saarbrcken (Germany), he looses to the Nazi Kurt Dieker through unfair means. As he tries to repay his dept by playing a prank on Dieker, he learns of Diekers real job: being a Nazi torturer. Sean manages to escape back to Paris with the Nazi invasion force on his heel. The game begins three month after these events in the now occupied Paris, where Sean meets the Resistance and more or less willingly joins up with them in order to execute his revenge on Dieker.<br><br>The Saboteur is a GTA-like open-world game set in Paris during World War II. The player takes on the role of Sean, looking him over the shoulder while he explores the city and its surroundings either on foot or by car. In order to move the story forward, the player has to fulfill missions for the resistance. But there's also a great amount of side-missions as well as many other things to do in the city including but not limited to blowing up stuff like sniper towers and Nazi tanks and killing Nazi generals. These so-called sabotage actions also net the player contraband, the currency of the game. With it he can buy weapons, upgrades and such at black-market dealers scattered around the city.<br><br>To do these sabotage acts, the player has access to several different kinds of weapons all from that time-period (including the needed dynamite) as well as his fists for melee-combat. But most of the time it is not wise for Sean to go directly into combat as he needs to escape the Nazis once an alarm has been raised in order to complete his missions. In addition the alarm level will creep up over time if he does additional damage to Nazi property and personal, alarming even heavier forces including tanks and zeppelins. To escape an alarm, he either has to leave a certain area or enter one of the many hide-spots while not being seen.<br><br>After completing a certain mission, the player will also be able to call Resistance-fighters at his side to help him in combat or bring him a getaway car. But these getaway cars need to be collected first by driving them into a black-market-garage. Once this has been done, the car be summoned at any garage. Through his actions the player also unlocks perks granting certain rewards like the 'Sucker Punch' which is gained after killing 10 enemy soldiers without them ever knowing. Sean can even slip into an enemy uniform to infiltrate the Nazis undetected but if he is seen doing a suspicious activity, the alarm will be raised after a certain amount of time. These activities include running and climbing around buildings similar to Altair in Assassin's Creed giving the player the freedom to choose his own route to his target.<br><br>At the start of the game, Paris and its surroundings are covered in black and white in a very similar style to the one seen in the movie Schindler's List with only certain colors standing out including the red in every Nazi-symbol and the yellow lights behind windows. As the player helps the Resistance liberate the sectors, color returns and Nazi activity goes down.

Description=Although Sacred 2: Fallen Angel is the successor to Sacred, the game takes place 2,000 years before Shaddar summoned the Sakkara-Demon. Set in Ancaria which is at the brink of another war, the player's goal is to prevent this war. However, it's entirely up to the player if the Light or the Chaos will prevail in the end.<br><br>All that just because of a godly energy called T-Energy. Once guarded by the Seraphim, then controlled by the High Elves, its exploitation was highly debated even among the High Elves, while more and more resistance began to form. In the end, what was feared to happen, happened: the big war started. Dragonkins, Temple Wardens, Humans, and Orcs fought side by side against the High Elves, but their power was already too great. After all of Ancaria was completely destroyed, they remained in control over the T-Energy. In the end even the remaining High Elves left their old home and built a new empire completely based on the powers of the T-Energy and inside that new home the tension between the high nobility and the clergy is escalating.<br><br>Meanwhile, the constant exploitation of T-Energy continues to contaminate whole zones and the once godly power now turns every living thing in these areas into terrible monster-mutations that destroy everything in their path.<br><br>In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between six characters of which only the Seraphim, a solid all-around character, has remained from the first game. The other five are all-new classes, such as the Dryads, masters of long-range combat and nature magic, or the Inquisitor which is somewhat an opposite to the Seraphim in all traits. Some of the class choices also effect the two campaigns and which available six gods the player may choose from. While the Seraphim can only tread on the path of Light, the Inquisitor is damned to walk the path of Chaos and has no access to the gods of light, nature, and philosophy.<br><br>While the choice of Light and Chaos effects how the campaign and its main quest ultimately play out, the gods each grant the player access to a very powerful spell. The god Testa for example, loads the hero up with T-Energy and allows the hero to shoot energy balls that heal friendly units and damage the enemies. However, as these spells are so powerful, they also have a very long cooling down period and should be used only as a last resort or against very powerful foes.<br><br>Once a character has been created, the game plays very much as the original game: the player takes on quests and kills creatures for experience points, loot to gain levels, and get more powerful.

So things went down from there.<br><br>Two years have passed now and the main protagonist finally wakes up from his sleep only to find himself in prison and the city of Stillwater controlled by several rival gangs with Johnny Gat about to be put on the electric chair.

Description=Based on the popular movie franchise of the same name, Saw casts the player as the former detective David Tapp, shortly after the events of the first movie. The Jigsaw Killer has healed his gunshot wound and has locked him up in an abandoned asylum to teach him a lesson about life appreciation. Tapp's primary tasks is to explore the building and find an exit, while avoiding or solving Jigsaw's traps and puzzles.<br><br>Upon starting the game Tapp is instantly faced with the task of removing a trap known as the Reverse Bear Trap, a mechanism that is set to go off and tear a human head apart. After getting the trap off his head, he is free to wander a mental institution filled with obstacles such as shotgun doors, broken glass that cuts Tapp's bare feet, and other victims of Jigsaw who are after Tapp because Jigsaw has hidden the key to their traps inside his chest. Mysteries surrounding the films need to be uncovered, there are different characters to meet and it is possible to see the sets recreated from them.<br><br>Tapp's actions affect the outcome of the game. If he is not careful, in some traps innocents will be killed, and some of those wandering the halls are not violent. Killing them affects the game's outcome, as well Tapp's ability to save others from certain traps.  The game has two endings, a positive and a negative.  The positive ending is the only ending which is canon to the films, the negative ending is not canon.  <br><br>Players control Tapp from a third-person perspective, and the game has a combat mechanism very similar to Silent Hill: Homecoming. He can use various weapons in the environments, however they will break after being used a few times. Some enemies have traps that may affect their skills; enemies with square shaped traps on their head cannot see but will attack if they can find you, while enemies with dynamite strapped to their hands will explode after death which can harm you, and so on.<br><br>Traps can be used against enemies as well; fuse boxes can be switched on above a pool of water and anyone who steps in will be electrocuted, and later in the game the player can re-set shotgun doors and hide from enemies. While progressing through the game, new kinds of traps can be found, as well as new weapons, light sources, and even the ability to create new traps or weapons from junk around the asylum. Some of the larger, more complex traps require Tapp to save both his own life as well as another person's life, and others may force him to make a decision between his own life or the others. These traps are often presented as complex puzzles. The game rewards the player for finding clues and documents strewn around the Asylum, and in many cases Tapp will not be able to escape a trap without the help of the clues.

Reputation points are earned by fulfilling the objects during each race. To that end, the races often don't start at the beginning. Instead the player e.g. has to make his way to the 10th place, starting from the 14th in only two rounds. <br><br>2. Simulation Mode: Here, everything is about realism - even on the lowest setting. The core is the career mode. The player once again starts out in the Superstock 1000 and has 8 seasons to become the new Superbike World Champion. But instead of challenges and chapters, this is the real deal featuring complete races (including qualifying and warm-up), a very sensitive control scheme and tons of ways to change the settings on the motorcycle to best suit the needs of the track and the player<br><br>Both modes require the player to create an individual rider by choosing his look, his outfit as well as his riding style and feature several quick-play-options.

Each stage is made up of multiple sections, culminating in a battle at the end with one of Ramona's exes. Around each stage there are many shops, some of them hidden, as well as destructible objects and weapons that can be picked up. The way characters progress and level up is similar to Castle Crashers and earlier levels can be revisited.<br><br>Each character starts with only a handful of moves -- punches, kicks, jumps, dashes, and blocks -- but as enemies are defeated, characters earn experience which unlocks new moves like running tackles and leg sweeps.

Items will often replenish health, as well as increase various character stats based around strength, speed, defence, and others.<br><br>Characters also have access to several special moves, which use a "Guts" meter: an area-clearing attack that has low power, but will knock nearby enemies away; and a special striker move, which will call in another character, usually Scott's romantic stalker Knives Chau, for a quick support attack. If a player manages to take out five enemies without taking a hit, their character will glow for a short time, increasing their speed and strength drastically.

Description=Scramble is a side scrolling shooter. Piloting a plane through varied (and mountainous)  terrain, your goal is to infiltrate an enemy base and destroy it. Missiles, tanks, UFO's, and other enemy artillery can all be found and will try to stop you. Colliding with any of these enemies, enemy fire, or the landscape will cause you to lose one of your planes. To fight back, your plane is equipped with both bombs and guns which can destroy most of the enemies you'll encounter. Your plane has a limited amount of fuel, and you'll crash if you run out. To replenish the fuel supply, you must bomb the fuel depots which will appear on the ground occasionally.

It features a story-mode (with 60 missions) including boss fights as well as local multiplayer and Xbox Live online matches for up to 4 players. Additional cars and weapons can be unlocked throughout the story mode by wrecking opponents and moving their cars to the junkyard. This adds their cars to the player's car pool where a maximum of four cars can be stored. Cars can be customized aesthetically, but also technically through upgrades paid for with points earned throughout the races. Cars are divided in different classes based on their statistics and sometimes a specific class of car needs to be used for a race. <br><br>Tracks feature shortcuts and jumps, and power-ups such as nitro boosts, health, repairs, extreme firepower, mines and missiles. All of the cars have a standard weapon, ranging from regular guns to melee weapons such as blades. There are 20 different vehicles to choose from. The different types of missions include regular races, derbies, and small arenas similar to those of Destruction Derby.<br><br>The game offers two ways of controlling the cars. First, a directional steering sending the car in the very direction the analog stick is pointed at, and secondly a traditional left/right steering as one can find it in regular racing games.

Description=The Arm of Orion has overrun New Madrid, one of the most remote colonies of the Empire. The United States Imperial Forces of course can't just stand by and watch and has send an army into the orbit of the planet. Part of this army: the 8th Armored Infantry or 'Section 8' for short. The best of the best the UISF has to offer. Also known as Helldivers, they are able to jump from a spaceship right down onto the planet without any parachute or other help besides their own full-body armor to fulfill mission objectives deep behind enemy lines. The singleplayer-campaign puts the player in the shoes of Alex Corde accompanied by his squadmates to help free New Madrid.<br><br>Section 8 is a multiplayer-focused and objective-based first-person-shooter. Killing enemies, capturing control points and completing dynamic combat missions grant victory points that in the end determine the victor of each multiplayer-battle with up to 40 players. Dynamic combat missions come in six types ranging from escorting an Commando as he assaults an enemy base, deploying an outpost at a strategic location or planting a bomb at the enemy base. To complete his job, the player has access to a vast range of weapons including machine guns and sniper rifles, equipment like repair tools and passive modules which increase his shield capacity or weapon damage. The player can change his loadout not only when he's dead but also on the field at deployable supply depots. In addition they also heal him and replenish his ammo.<br><br>Supply depots are either created automatically by the game once certain objectives have been met or can be bought and build by players that have earned enough money by killing enemies and completing objectives. Also available on the shopping list are combat structures which include three types of turrets as well as a tank, a mech-like heavy armor and an armored transport. Except for the heavy armor, all vehicles have place for more than one player, especially making the tank a powerful weapon thanks to it's four weapon systems each of which is controlled by a single player.<br><br>The armor of Section 8 not only can withstand a drop from high altitudes, it also has an integrated jetpack, allowing for short periods of flight and a booster to temporarily run faster. These functions consume energy which is automatically replenished when not used. The drop from the sky, called Orbital Burn-In, which is the way the players spawn, can be controlled to a limited degree. While the spawn-point can be chosen from a map, the players can decide themselves when to engage the breaks of their suit. While a soft landing allows for the player to immediately go into combat and steer a little bit, it makes him vulnerable during drop-down. A hard landing on the other hand is fast but the player then needs a few seconds to recover from the impact.<br><br>While Conquest is the only gameplay-mode available, there are different types of bot-modes available. Besides playing a game without any bot, the host can choose between Balanced (filling the game to the maximum number of players allowed with bots), Coop / Extreme Coop (all players are on one team, bots on the other) and Swarm / Super Swarm (one small team against a large swarm of hostile bots). Only available in singleplayer is the One Man Army-mode which pits the player alone against an entire team of hostile bots.

After the two went out into the mountains to explore a cave, Claire gets kidnapped by some mysterious men and Jason infiltrates their complex built into the caves to rescue her and ultimately stop the Restoration in what they are doing.<br><br>The game plays similar to the Metroid series. While the graphics are 3D, the entire game is a 2D platformer with an emphasis on exploration. The player can acquire various weapons throughout the game, each of them can be used to reveal new paths within the cave. For example, green rocks, hatches or doors need to be blown up with grenades, while orange ones require the use of guns, purple ones have circuitry that needs to be disabled with foam and red ones need to be fired at with missiles. There are hidden rooms within the world, which can sometimes only be reached once the player has the appropriate weapon. This means the game involves a lot of back tracking, for example to gain new bonus items, like increased health or grenade capacity.<br><br>In later parts of the game Jason gets access to new movement abilities through parts of a special suit. They allow him to double and triple jump, get a jet pack boost or use a hook to cling to walls and ceilings. He is also able to run at hyper speed, breaking special walls and find gear that allows him to breathe underwater for an unlimited amount of time. The main quest is split up into separate missions and these are shown as a blue path on the map. A flashlight reveals hidden paths that can be explored by highlighting them in the corresponding weapon code colour. Killing enemies and progressing further in the game levels up Jason, giving him increased stats.

Description=Shrek-N-Roll is a small game based off the characters of the animated Shrek films, with Shrek as the giant green ogre and a host of friends and enemies, such as Fiona, Donkey, Puss-in-Boots, Charming, ... Completing every level eventually makes 24 characters available, with only aesthetic differences and no influence on the gameplay.<br><br>Gameplay is based around balancing a baby Shrek snack in the form of a ball in levels usually in the form of a tower. There is a character positioned on either side of the screen, with in between a beam where the snack rolls, like guiding a marble on a see-saw or a labyrinth tilt-and-roll game. Each analogue stick controls a character, left and right, as they contort a crank to raise and lower the beam to collect coins, extra snacks, and extra lives. They also have to dodge windows, and purple vortexes (some of them moving about) that suck the snack inside and require to restart the level. By varying how the sticks are moved, the angle of the beam changes. To complete a level, a number of snacks needs to be fed to Baby Shrek without losing too many along the way. Some levels have a little variation where Baby Shrek for instance licks the ball, making it more sticky and easier to control.<br><br>There are 16 levels in total, based on 4 environments from the films such as The Swamp or Evil Queen's Castle. Multiplayer is supported locally, for two players, in a cooperative or a versus mode. In versus the screen is split vertically and introduces power-ups to steal the opponent's multiplier or have his beam disappear for a short while. The goal is to be the first to reach the ogre baby at the top.

Description=Revolution is a turn-based strategy game about development and territorial expansion, with sixteen distinct civilizations from prehistoric times to the future. Not counting Silent Service, it is the second console-only Sid Meier branded game, the first being Sid Meier's C.P.U. Bach, and it is the first in the Civilization sub series to be released on console platforms.<br><br>Specifically built up with console controls in mind, the original gameplay is intact but with stripped-down complexity. The available civilizations include America, England, Japan, Aztec, China, India, Mongolia, Rome, Egypt, France, Arabia, Greece, Spain, Germany, Zulu and Russia, each with their own leaders (e.g. Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln) and specific perks. Another civilization, the Barbarians, is not playable and they constantly wage war with the other ones. Gameplay sessions are generally shorter with fewer victory conditions and simplified city management. The possible strategies are still very open, as the four victory conditions are Domination, Technology, Economic and Cultural. Players can either build vast armies and try to dominate the other civilizations to capture their cities (Domination), or use a more subtle, diplomatic approach to gain the upper hand. There is a technology tree to eventually move into space and be the first to reach Alpha Centauri (Technology), players can try to create a World Back earn 20,000 gold (Economic), or build twenty wonders (Cultural).<br><br>Units are often specific for a certain civilization and gain experience, as well as through research, to access upgrades. That way, a catapult can eventually become a tank. The focus is as usual on micromanagement. The two single-player modes allow for straight matches against AI players or rather fixed scenarios to complete. Multiplayer is supported for up to four players, free-for-all or with teams.

Description=Those Russians again. Just because they felt threatened by America and their nuclear bomb, they had to look for uranium themselves after World War II ended. However, instead of uranium, they found something else on the small island off the east coast of Russia, now called Katorga-12. What did they find? E99 - the most powerful energy source known to man. Of course Stalin immediately realized the scope of this discovery and pumped as many funds as possible into researching its military potential.<br><br>In the beginning, everything was fine. However, after the death of the famous dictator, his successor wanted more. So instead of being careful and taking it slowly, he had to rush the scientists on Katorga-12. It is no wonder that in 1955 something went completely wrong, leading to the creation of the Singularity which in turn kills everyone on the island, basically shutting down the whole project. Wait, "killing everyone"? Well, not everyone as it turns out, when in 2010 an American spy-satellite picks up radiation over the island, putting the government at high alert because of the fear of another Chernobyl disaster. To find out what is going on, they sent the Black-Ops-team Spartan-21 to investigate. Sadly, their mission fails a few moments after the intro movie. As one of the sole survivors of the helicopter crash, it's now up to the player in the role of Nathaniel Renko to uncover the mystery of Katorga-12.<br><br>In its core, Singularity is a straight-forward shooter, heavily inspired by games like BioShock (overall look of the game, audio tapes and notes which tell the story of what happened on the island) and Cryostasis (flashbacks with ghosts which show scenes from the past some of which the player takes part in). The player looks through the eyes of Nathaniel while shooting his way through the fairly linear levels of the game using more or less futuristic weapons (of which he can only carry two at a time). The weaponry includes a pistol, a shotgun as well as more more original stuff like the Seeker which shoots E99-enriched bullets controlled by the player. Each weapon can be upgraded several times increasing the size of the magazine or its strength. These upgrades, as well as swapping weapons and buying additional ammunition, is done at weapon lockers scattered around the levels. In order to do an upgrade however, the player needs to find both hidden cages containing weapons technology as well as collect the E99-technology lying around.<br><br>The main creative ideas however, are focused on the Time Manipulation Device (TMD) the player finds early in the game. Wrapped around his left arm and constantly being upgraded during the course of the game, this device allows the player to manipulate space and time both in combat and for solving riddles. Using the TMD on human targets like the Russian soldiers on the island, will result in them dying from old age within seconds. The different kinds of monsters (mostly former humans hit by the Singularity) however react differently e.g. some explode after a few seconds. Later in the game, the player can even turn a human soldier into a monster which in turn fights for a certain amount of time on his side.<br><br>Thanks to the ability of the TMD to manipulate the age of an item, it is also important to solve the many riddles. This way the player can age a crate until it collapses, use the TMD like the Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2 to place the remains under a almost closed rolling gate and then return the crate to its original state which in turn pushes the gate open. In addition to the automatic upgrades granted throughout the game, adding abilities like a time-ball which freezes everything inside it in place, the player will also find formulas during his journey once again using them in addition to E99-technology at specific upgrade-stations to further increase the powers of the device. Finding the TMD also allows the player to travel back in time to 1955 when everything went downhill at certain points in the game, giving him the chance to alter the course of history in order to reach his goals. While his choices are predefined there, the game still plays heavily with the mind of the player thanks to these trips back and even offers three different endings.<br><br>The game also features multiplayer for up to 12 players in the two team-based modes "Creatures vs. Soldiers" and "Extermination". While the latter is simply Team Deathmatch, "Creature vs. Soldiers" requires the soldiers to capture beacons on the map and defend them for a certain amount of time in order for the next one to become available while the creatures do everything in their power to prevent that. In both modes, players can choose from four different classes on each team and can customize them a little bit like choosing which weapon and TMD-power the player uses as a soldier. While the soldier-classes are pretty straight forward, the four creatures are all very unique and each have their own special abilities to compensate for the soldiers having access to the powerful TMD including seeing enemies through walls or turning into a soldier for a short time.

It's also home to an ultra-rare form of uranium called "Black 235" whose trade allows the local dictator General Manuel Vasquez to acquire military hardware and infrastructure. At first glance Vasquez is basically a drug dealer who was send by the cartel to Isla Trueno to run their drug operations on the island. This of course didn't keep him from overthrowing the government, cleansing the island from any of his opposition and clean out whole neighborhoods with his deaths squads. The world watched it happening. The island is after all rich with resources and everyone wants a piece of it. So all is well on Isla Trueno? Well, it would be if the government Vasquez overthrew hadn't been a US-backed one. Now a highly trained special ops team arrives on the island with one goal and one goal only: kill Vasquez.<br><br>In most of the 16 missions of the game, the player is put into the shoes of Gunnery Sergeant Tyler Wells, a MOS 0317 (Scout Sniper). Crawling from cover to cover in first person with one of the four different sniper models including the Russian Dragunov and the German MSG-90, carefully lining up shots and vanishing into the scenery after the kill has been made. Tyler also has access to a silenced pistol and throwing knives if things get a bit more personal, but most of the time the player views his targets from at least a 100 meters away.<br><br>Getting the kill-shot at such a range isn't an easy task, especially considering that the AI can hear and find the origin of a shot pretty fast. So one shot, one kill or the whole camp is alerted to the player's presence. In this regard, Sniper: Ghost Warrior is all about realism. When using the sniper, many things factor into weather or not the bullet will hit its target. The trajectory for example is influenced by the distance (the higher, the more the bullet looses velocity until the target), the wind direction (moving the bullet from left to right) and the pulse of Tyler. Expecting to run to cover and then immediately make the head-shot is a no-go and instead an excercise in trying to keep the cross-hair from swinging around so much. If the enemy is moving, the player also has to factor in the time the bullet takes to the target. In addition there are some materials the bullet can go through - including multiple enemies standing in a row. At the lower difficulty levels, the player can hold his breath to activate a slow-motion effect, the enemies are marked red (and friendlies can't even be injured) and a small red circle shows where the bullet will hit to make it easier for unexperienced players. If the target zone is around the head area, a (deactivate-able) kill-cam will activate, showing how the bullet flies to and into the target, making for a gory depiction of the kill.<br><br>The game however doesn't solely feature sniper-stealth-missions. Instead during the campaign, the player will slip into the boots of other members of the team like the spotter, which makes out targets for the sniper and normal grunts. They run guns blazing through the enemy camp, using standard equipment like the M16 or AK-47 (picked up from fallen enemies) as well as the old "blowing shit up"-perk to take out the enemy while searching for the secret laptops scattered around the levels. They unlock access to more or less interesting email-messages, giving a little more context to what is happening on the island.<br><br>In singleplayer, the game uses a mixture of medi-packs and automatic healing. If the player's health goes under 30 and he gets to safety fast, his health will regenerate back to 30. For everything above he needs to find said medi-packs of which he can carry five at a time. In multiplayer it's all about auto regeneration. Here up to eight players can try to find and kill each other on the six large maps in three different game-modes: Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch and VIP. The latter is a King of the Hill-variant in which a random player is assigned the status of "VIP" at the start of the round. Killing him, will result in more points for the killer and transfer of the VIP status to that player. In multiplayer each player carries the standard equipment sniper, pistol and knives. Which sniper he gets depends on his class choice. Each of the four classes also differs in how much health they have and how fast they can run.

Description=Sol Survivor is a tower defence game. The player takes the role of a commander who has to defend colonies against an alien assault. The aliens known as the Ascendancy arrives at the colonies through drop ships and once they have landed they follow a path through the colony towards the town center where they start consuming the souls of the inhabitants of the colony. Each alien, or creep as they are called, that reaches the town center consumes a soul and once all colonists are lost the game is over. To battle the creeps and defend the colony the player builds turrets along the path that automatically attack the enemies whenever they are within range. The player has access to several kinds of turrets and more can be unlocked by advancing through the ranks. Each turret has its own characteristics such as range, rate of fire and fire power. The enemies are also resistant or vulnerable towards some kinds of attack. Turrets can be built anywhere at the map except on the paths. The resource used to build turrets is called mass and is automatically gathered from dead enemies. Turrets can't be moved though if the player wants to get rid of one he can sell it for 75% of its cost. It's also possible to upgrade turrets up to level three.<br><br>In addition to his turrets the player is also able to launch orbital support attacks which are useful for taking out the last few enemies that have slipped through the defences. To launch a support attack the player needs power which automatically replenishes over time. As with turrets, support attacks exists in several different kinds such as lasers, missiles, EMP's or even nukes. The turrets and support attacks available depends on which commander the player chooses to play as. For example a scientist has more technically advanced weapons such as lasers and EMP's while a more traditional commander uses mortars and machine guns. <br><br>The game has four campaigns each with its own look and feel. Each campaign consists of a number of colonies and for each colony a number of creep waves has to be defeated. In addition to this there is a survival mode where the player is up to an endless amount of waves that just gets tougher and tougher. The player can then challenge his friends to beat his best times. The game also features multiplayer modes both through a local network and Internet. Multiplayer includes both versus and co-operative modes in different flavours.

Description=Yet again Sonic and friends find themselves wrapped up in the schemes of Dr. Robotnik. This time he plans to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their own ways five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.<br><br>The player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has their own unique version of each level. Sonic's levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic's except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can't charge up ramps or run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost frog. Big's levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed.<br><br>Additionally each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby Chaos. By petting, feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into races against other Chaos. As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed to acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don't do anything in this version of the game. Finally at one time it was possible to go online and download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such a Christmas theme for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&amp;T, but since SegaNet shut down this is no longer possible.

Description=Sonic makes his Kinect debut with a Kinect-exclusive sequel to the previous generation's Sonic Riders title.  Sonic Free Riders is notable for also for being a minority in Kinect releases as just about the only launch title that's not only a sequel, but part of a pre-existing game franchise, where most titles are Kinect-specific "show-off" titles for the controller-free hardware add-on.  The game is also billed by Sega as being the first Sega title controlled by "full body movements".<br><br>Like previous entries in the series, the game is played controlling characters from the Sonic franchise as they race through closed tracks going over jumps, performing stunts, and attacking one another.  The difference now, as is perhaps obvious, is that the controller is removed in place of full body movement for control.  The game is for one or two players on a single Xbox 360, or up to eight online.  There is even a mode, called Tag mode, where two players may work together in a race by placing their hands together and moving in sync to control their characters onscreen.  Besides the series' trademark "hoverboards," the option to ride bikes has been added to the game.<br><br>There is a story mode to the game featuring Sonic and friends, essentially, versus some bad guys--a bunch of birds from "Team Babylon."  Story mode features four teams, each with three characters, along with some additional characters.  The teams are Team Heroes, Team Babylon, Team Rose, and Team Dark with nineteen total characters, including a player's Xbox 360 Avatar as an option.  Characters are divided up into three classes as before, known as Speed, Flight, and Power.  <br><br>Players can collect rings through the race tracks which can be used to level up characters, and to enhances various attributes.  Besides this, there are weapons and other items which are used by specific motion controls, such as physically throwing a missile or other item at another player or character.  <br><br>Menu navigation can be controlled by voice through the Kinect device.

Description=Sonic and Knuckles continues the story directly from where Sonic the Hedgehog 3 left off.  The explosion from the Death Egg sends Sonic flying deep into Floating Island's Mushroom Hills.  Sonic knows of the Master Emerald hidden somewhere on Floating Island, and is sure that Dr. Robotnik wants it to give his Death Egg limitless power.  Knuckles probably knows where it is - but can Sonic stop Robotnik's plans and find the Master Emerald all while fighting off Knuckles?  Meanwhile, Knuckles is guarding Floating Island when he's attacked by one of Robotnik's robots!  He quickly begins a chase for revenge.<br><br>Sonic & Knuckles is the fourth game in the Sonic series.  It retains the same basic features as in the previous Sonic games (speed, rings for protection, Special Stages with Chaos Emeralds) as well as the three different shield types introduced in Sonic 3 (Fire, Water and Electric).  Players can select either of the two title characters for play - either Sonic, or the all-new Knuckles the Echidna.  Knuckles cannot jump as high as Sonic, but he can glide by holding the jump button while in the air.  If you glide into a wall, Knuckles will also be able to climb it.  He can also break through walls that Sonic can't.  With these abilities, Knuckles can access different areas from Sonic, making for each level an entirely new experience.<br><br>Unlike Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles features three bonus stages - two are available by jumping into the lamppost checkpoint stars (as in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  These stages give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  The first is a Casino-themed level where you can jump into a slot machine and earn (or lose!) rings.  The second is a more skill-based level where you must time your jumps off orbs to launch higher and collect bonuses.  If you hit the barrier at the bottom of the stage, it ends.  The other type of bonus stage is the "Special Stage" seen in Sonic 3, which, as previously, can be accessed by jumping into giant rings hidden within the levels themselves.  If the player collects all the blue spheres in these stages (while avoiding all the red ones) they will earn a Chaos Emerald.<br><br>A unique feature of the Sonic & Knuckles cart is the ability to "Lock-On" previous Sonic games into a cartridge slot at the top.  Adding Sonic 3 will combine both Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles into one long game, as well as adding the ability to save, and use Tails in the Sonic & Knuckles levels.  Plugging in Sonic 2 lets players use Knuckles in Sonic 2, as well allowing the use of his glide and wall climb abilities.  Finally, plugging in the original Sonic the Hedgehog cart lets the player access unlimited level variations of the Blue Sphere bonus stage.  Subsequent re-releases of Sonic & Knuckles have also included most of these bonus features.

Description=The easiest way to describe Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing would be to call it a Super Mario Kart clone. But instead of featuring famous Nintendo-characters like Mario and Bowser, the players use Sonic, Billy Hatcher, Dr. Eggman and 17 other more or less famous characters from the SEGA games library.<br><br>The core gameplay remains the same though: in a normal race the player has to compete against seven other racers using both his racing skills and one of the several different power ups that are scattered around the track like a boxing glove to shoot racers in front out of the way or mines to destroy his pursuers. Since all cars drive at the same speed, no matter which character they belong to, charging up the boost by doing drifts is the most important thing in order to get to first place. Tricks are also available to gain access to a turbo-boost. But the decision what racer and car to use does influence which All-Star-Action is available to the player. While Sonic the Hedgehog turns into Super Sonic for a short while, giving him a great amount of additional speed, Billy Hatcher lays egg-shells on the track to obstruct his followers. Like all other power-ups, the All-Star-Action has to be collected on the track first before it can be used.<br><br>The game features several different game-modes. In single player the player can either do time trials, single races, a Grand Prix or one of the several dozen missions that are available and require the player to fulfil many different goals other than simply being the first in a race. These goals include using one long drift to get to the finish line, roll over as many crows as possible or get to the finish line without destroying any pots and many more. <br><br>Multiplayer consists of a split screen mode for up to four players and an online mode (not available in the PC-version). Besides normal races several battle modes are waiting like King of the Hill or simple Deathmatch. Completing a mission or winning a race either in single player or in multiplayer earns the player SEGA miles which are used in the internal shop to unlock additional characters and tracks.<br><br>The Xbox 360-release features in addition to the SEGA characters and tracks also Rares Banjo-Kazooie - hence the additional subtitle.

Description=Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent, Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and jumps with ease. <br><br>The plot of the game is simple. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal friends, and trapped them inside  robots.  Fortunately, Sonic can free his friends by destroying the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control the all-powerful chaos emeralds. Sonic must grab them before he does in the 3D rotating bonus levels. <br><br>Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping, Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels, Sonic collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies. Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. <br><br>The game is divided into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. <br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog is a significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."

Description=The evil Dr. Robotnik wants to conquer the world. In order to do that, he imprisons and transforms all animals into robots called 'Badniks'. This way they can build his powerful weapon, the Death Egg.  Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from taking over the world. <br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog.  Like the original, players run through different worlds called "Zones", which each have their own specific theme.  There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress.<br><br>Sonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the levels.  As with most platformers, when the player collects 100 rings, they earn an extra life.  However, the rings also act as protection - if Sonic is hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible.  If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life.<br><br>If the player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access the Special Stage.  In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint.  Complete all the checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.<br><br>New to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails.  Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play.  Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a "Spin Dash".  This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where you need some momentum.<br><br>The game also features a 2-player versus mode.  This mode is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones in the single player game.

With Knuckles tricked and trying to stop the heroes at every turn, will they be able to stop Robotnik in time?<br><br>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is the third in the Sonic series of games.  As with the previous games, it is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed.

Sonic can jump on enemies to defeat them, and Spin Dash by holding down and the jump button, then letting go of down.<br><br>New to Sonic 3 are three different types of shields - the Fire Shield (which protects you from fire but disappears if you enter water), the Water Shield (which lets you breathe underwater infinitely) and the Electric Shield (which pulls nearby rings towards you).  Sonic can use extra abilities when he has these shields by pressing jump while in the air - either a horizontal fireball dash, a vertical bubble bounce, or an electric double jump.  If Sonic has no shield active, he can activate a brief energy shield, also by pressing jump in the air.  Tails cannot use the shields' special abilities, but he can instead either fly or dog paddle (in water) for a limited time.  He can also carry Sonic with him while doing so.<br><br>There are now two types of bonus stages - one is available by collecting 50 or more rings, running past a checkpoint lamppost and then jumping into the stars (as you could in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.  This stage give you the chance to earn bonus rings, lives and power-ups.  In this stage, there is a giant gumball machine.  By hitting the crank, you'll spit out a bonus item that can either be rings, lives or bonus shields.  The stage is over when you fall down the bottom of the screen.<br><br>The other, more important, Special Stage can be accessed by jumping into giant rings that are hidden away in secret areas in each level.  In these stages, you must collect all the blue spheres while avoiding the red ones (which end the stage early).  Collecting all of the outer blue spheres around square or rectangle sphere formations will turn them all into rings - if you collect 50 or more in this stage, you can earn a continue.  Once you collect all the blue spheres in the stage, it clears and you earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.<br><br>Sonic 3 features six different Zones, which are made up of two Acts.  At the end of each Act is a boss that must be defeated to complete the stage and rescue Sonic's animal friends that Robotnik has captured to turn into Badnik robots.  The zones in Sonic 3 are approximately three times bigger than those in Sonic 2, and feature multiple, branching paths.<br><br>As with Sonic 2, there is a two-player Vs. Mode, which plays in a split-screen horizontal style.  There are special monitor pick-ups in this mode which do things like swap player positions, lose rings, or cause a Badnik to appear.  You can also race against the clock in a time trial mode.

Description=Sonic The Hedgehog 4, as the title indicates, is a direct sequel to the classical series of Sonic platformers on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis. The story continues after the events of Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, where Sonic and his friends spoiled the plans of Sonic's nemesis, Dr. Eggman (a.k.a. Dr. Robotnik), once again by destroying his Death Egg and returning the stolen Master Emerald. The victory, however, is short-lived, as Eggman is up to revenge and rebuilds and improves his greatest creations for the sole purpose of destroying Sonic once and for all.<br><br>The game does not only return to the original series in terms of story and title, but also in terms of gameplay. Sonic 4 is a classical 2D sidescroller like its predecessors and also features the same game mechanics as the old games. There are some new additions, for example the &quot;Homing Attack&quot; which locks on Sonic's jump on enemies, jumping pads or breakable items. One major difference are the graphics, as Sonic 4 uses polygons for the Sonic characters and prerendered graphics for everything else, so does not recreate the looks of its predecessors, unlike, for example, Mega Man 9.

There are also different background themes to choose from.<br><br>Sorry! Sliders is a conversion of the fairly recent board game. It builds on the concept of the classic game of Sorry! with a different board layout and a focus more action. Players slide a piece down a lane towards a bulls-eye in the middle of the board. The closer to the bulls-eye it lands, the more points are provided. Other players can also slide their pieces and knock yours off. The real goal however is to bring all pieces home by spending points and moving up a ladder. In some cases it is therefore needed to score only a minimum amount of points.<br><br>The pieces are thrown with the left analog stick and the bumpers are used to aim. Next to the classic game there are different advanced variants with a swirling vortex in the middle instead of a bulls-eye, or a black hole that sends the pieces back to the starting position. There are also battle boxes in the target zone that provide power-ups for your pieces. They become very tiny for instance (and are hard to hit for opponents) or become transparent ghosts unaffected by other pieces in the way. Multiplayer is supported for up to four players, locally or online.

The goal is to find the way to heaven through a number of maze like locations filled with dangers and horror. Touching any of the walls, floors, ceilings or various enemies results in instant death.

There are also horror elements which include sudden close ups of screaming deformed dead people to frighten the player, as they show up without warning at certain points throughout the game.

Description=Continuing the eternally retold tale of souls and swords, Soulcalibur IV is once again the story of the swords Soul Edge and Soul Calibur and those who want to have or destroy them. The swords are on the fast-track to resurrect an ancient king, and only the player can stop him from unleashing his ambiguous evil upon the world.<br><br>Soulcalibur IV continues the series' 3D blade fighting game play, with a few enhancements. The ability to break your opponent's defences from the first game finally returns in the form of destructible armour. Corresponding to the game's high, middle and low attacks, armour will weaken in these areas the more the player guards against attacks until the armour finally shatters. Also new is a Soul Gauge, which measures green-to-red how much a player has defended. Pushing the gauge beyond red causes a Soul Crush, which will create the opportunity for the opponent to do a character-unique one-shot kill called a Critical Finish.<br><br>Most of the regular cast returns for this bout with the addition of several new characters, the most publicized of which are Yoda on the Xbox 360, Darth Vader on the PlayStation 3, and Darth Vader's Apprentice on both consoles. All three characters have force powers that make use of an additional force meter that limits how often the powers can be used. Use beyond the meter will instead start draining the life of the character. Also new is Hilde, an armour-clad woman defending her homeland against the forces of the Soul Edge with a long pole-arm and shortsword. The final boss Algol is also a playable character, wielding the Soul Edge as one hand and the Soul Calibur as the other, as well as wreaking havoc with his teleporting chair. In addition, five "bonus" characters, each specially designed by a Japanese artist are included that recycle the move lists from the a-list characters.<br><br>The regular Story, Arcade, Training and Versus modes are still present, but Soulcalibur III's Chronicles of the Sword is supplanted with a new endurance-style campaign called Tower of Lost Souls. Players Ascend, and then Descend the tower by fighting waves of enemies, unlocking new items along the way by achieving certain conditions such as no ring outs or taking no damage. The versus mode is available in both regular and special varieties, the former enforcing only baseline characters while the latter allowing the use of customized skill sets and equipment. New to the series are online modes allowing you to play on the Internet with other players. Both ranked and unranked matches are available in the same regular and special modes as versus.<br><br>New characters and items are unlocked by spending Gold that is earned in the online or single-player modes, with some characters only unlocked by defeating them in the single-player modes. Gold can also be spent in the museum to unlock artwork.<br><br>Also returning from Soulcalibur III is the create-a-character feature that allows you to create your own custom fighter that can be used in all of the game modes. The selection of parts for characters is greatly expanded upon from Soulcalibur III, and it is also now possible to customize the equipment of the stock characters with the exception of the force users, the final boss Algol and the five "bonus" characters. Unlike the previous game equipment is now more than aesthetic, granting boosts or penalties to HP, defence, attack and various skill points. The skill points can be used to equip new skills that provide abilities such as Auto-Counter, Anti-Ring Out, and boosting stats when the Soul Gauge is low.

Players use coins dropped by defeated enemies to construct and upgrade new automated defenses along a linear path.

They can throw snowballs as a source of extra attack power, collect dropped coins used to purchase towers and upgrades, and trigger a special power unique to each character. These powers range from restoring some of the defended object's health, to clearing the screen of enemies with a fire attack. In single-player, the player switches between each of the four boys, positioning them or taking control as needed.  In multiplayer, each player is assigned a character they stick with for that level.<br><br>There are 11 levels structured like an episode of the show.

While in the zone, the Space Giraffe can collide with enemies, knock them off the rim and fire additional, guidable shots. Bullets are also slowed down there. Power-ups are called pods. Up to five can be stored and they allow the Space Giraffe to jump, filling the entire power zone. When more than 5 pods are kept, the additional ones provide bonuses such as extra lives, faster bullets, a bonus round or bonus points.<br><br>The visuals consists of bright and psychedelic shapes. The different enemies have different attack patterns and include Grunts, Flowers, Boffins, Feedback Monsters, Rotors, Containers and Zappers. There are more than 100 levels in the game and players can play custom music synchronizing with the visuals.<br><br>The windows version was updated with a new shader library, used to create a NUXX mix of the graphic design of the levels.

Description=The Splatterhouse franchise rises from the dead in this new high-definition revamp!  The new Splatterhouse is not a sequel, but rather a re-telling of the original story following poor battered hero Rick as he dons the Terror Mask and works his way through hordes of demons, monsters, and other beasties to save his girlfriend, Jennifer, from the mysterious and evil Dr. Henry West.  <br><br>Like the previous classic entries in the series, Splatterhouse is a beat-em-up style action game in a horror setting.  And like previous entries in the series, Rick is transformed into a hulking beast of a man when he puts on the Terror Mask.  In the classic games, Rick's primary attack was to punch enemies with some kicking involved, and occasionally picking up crude weapons, such as a 2x4 piece of wood.  Like the previous entries, players work their way through horror-themed environments inside a creepy mansion with boss battles at the end of each stage.<br><br>All of these features remain in the HD revamp, but there are several levels of depth added.  Two buttons are used for punching, another for grappling, and there are "modifier" buttons which add sprint options and mix up the "standard" attacks.  Over two dozen combos and special attacks are available for players to unlock and master adding new levels of variety and depth to the beat-em-up formula.  Rick can still pick up various weapons and items, and even turns parts of his body into a weapon once the abilities are unlocked.  Rick also has several finishing moves at his disposal, which can be activated when beaten enemy characters feature a red halo around their body.<br><br>Through the gameplay, players spill and collect gallons of blood and splatter from enemy characters, and this blood works as currency to purchase upgrades to weapons, attack combos, more health, and the like. <br><br>Rick will show several levels of damage to his body as he is attacked and hurt featuring anything from exposed ribs to a missing arm.  While limbs regenerate over time, health must be siphoned from enemies.  With health recharging occurring largely whenever the player wants it, Rick takes damage fairly easily forcing players to carefully monitor and maintain their health during the mayhem of the gameplay.  <br><br>Splatterhouse features collectibles such as pieces of sexy pictures of Jennifer and logbook notes in the form of gramophones strewn throughout the stages.  These can be viewed in the Collectibles section of the main menu.  <br><br>Besides the regular Story mode, there is a Survival mode which expands with more stages as players progress through the Story mode.  Survival mode simply puts players in a stage with the challenge being, perhaps obviously, survival.  Like Story mode, there are pictures that can be collected through the Survival mode.<br><br>Splatterhouse also features another bonus--which is the original trilogy, once they have been unlocked through regular gameplay.<br><br>Splatterhouse is a one-player game and also allows for custom soundtracks.  Beyond original music, the standard game features over a dozen Heavy Metal songs which are typically played during action-heavy sequences.  Some bands featured include Cavalera Conspiracy, High on Fire, The Accused, and Five Finger Death Punch.

But instead of just racing around the tracks and trying to be first just by out-thinking the other drivers, everyone has access to a so-called power play bar. By doing drifts, drafting (driving in the slipstream of another car) or avoiding an activated power play, the three sections of the bar fill up. While the first two are used to activate two level-1-power-plays, filling up the third will give the player access to a level-2-power-play.<br><br>If a section of the bar is filled, the player will see an icon above the cars ahead once they are in range of a power play. These power plays are for example a helicopter who drops exploding barrels or a parked car rigged to explode but also really big stuff like a train-bridge that goes up in flames or a whole ship sliding to the side. While the first two are level-1-power-plays, the second two are level-2-power-plays. Activating a Level-2-power-plays will also result in a change of the track. Once the ship has been blown up, the normal route is blocked by fire so the drivers have to use the deck of the ship as an alternate route. There are also often shortcuts on the track which are opened up by spending a level-1-power-play and will close a few seconds afterwards, crushing anyone who was foolish enough to follow the player (or whoever opened it up). The reason to use these power plays is simple: wrecking the opponent, either by letting him crash into things or shaking him up so much that he looses control of his car and crashes himself. Of course the player has to be careful. He too can be caught up in his own power play, loosing his advantage and more often then not even the entire race.<br><br>Besides the normal races, the game features several other game modes like "Destruction" in which the player has to get to the finish line as fast as possible while every power play on the track is automatically triggered. "Air Strike" on the other hand requires the player to dodge missiles shot by a helicopter flying ahead. The mode "Air Revenge" takes this even further, allowing the player to return those missiles to their origin.<br><br>During the course of the campaign, the player earns credits depending on which place he finished an event. By earning credits, the player automatically unlocks access to the final event of each episode, an elite race, and new cars. In addition the player unlocks special decals by doing crazy stuff like winning a race by a split-second. Each episode also features a bonus event which needs to be unlocked first by wrecking a certain amount of cars in the other events.<br><br>Split/Second features on all platforms a split-screen-mode for two players as well as online multiplayer for up to eight players with three different game modes available.

In the game the player learns more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunts down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska in a gameplay-style very simliar to Lego Star Wars.<br><br>The game is fully build around drop in/drop out-coop for two players. This means each mission in this 3rd-person-action-adventure features two famous characters from the TV series including Obi-Wan Kenobi, the padawan Asoka and Captain Rex but separated by class. The players either control commandos or Jedi-characters - never both mixed as they have totally different abilities and limitations. If no second player is available, the AI will automatically take over the second character and help overcome the many obstacles waiting ahead - mostly in form of several different kinds of separatist droids. While the players can use their lightsaber or blaster to fend them off, the Jedi-characters also have the ability to ride the droids by jumping onto them from behind. This is not only useful to blast through enemy lines but is also used to solve specific riddles preventing the characters from moving on. In addition the droids can be forced to dance with every other droid on the screen following his lead making them defenseless. These dances are unique for each droid and need to be bought first in the shop. Also available there: funny masks and combat upgrades like stronger blasters or a more powerful force-push.<br><br>To buy these things, the players have to unlock them first and then need to invest points which are gained by killing enemies as well as by successfully completing missions or the mini-games. These mini-games are scattered around the levels and turn up once a specific section has been completed. They mostly involve killing as many enemies as possible in a short amount of time. Each kill in succession both during normal gameplay and the mini-games also ranks up the multiplier adding even more points to the account. Once a player dies, he will respawn at the nearest checkpoint either immediately if he plays alone or after the second player has reached one - both times without any penalties.

Description=Effectively acting as Star Wars: Episode III and a half, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed puts players in the role of Darth Vader's Secret Apprentice in and all new adventure that bridges the gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. Armed with an over-the-top arsenal of Force powers, players follow the Apprentice through his journey of vengeance and redemption, villainy and heroism, as he travels the galaxy with the crew of his starship, the Rogue Shadow. Taken by Vader at a young age, the Secret Apprentice is raised as a slave of the Dark Side, but as he hurtles towards his destiny that will have far reaching implications for Star Wars continuity, he will discover much about his past and his future.<br><br>In the course of the game, the player will travel from planet to planet hunting down all remaining Jedi for Darth Vader. Each location (the junk planet Raxus Prime, densely forested Kashyyyk, organic fungal Felucia, and other surprise areas) has new enemies that require different Force powers to defeat, and so the player gains access to them at the start of each new level. For example, most enemies on Raxus are mechanical, so the player learns Force Lightning at the start of the level to exploit this. In addition to the Force Powers, players can use the customization screen to purchase different Force Combos, which combine lightsaber moves with Force Powers and even include several grapple moves. All of these abilities can be powered up in the customization screen, which also has options for tweaking the lightsaber and choosing among several different costumes.<br><br>The game rewards players for defeating enemies in flashy ways, using Force powers and the environment instead of simply hacking with the lightsaber. Different "bonuses" are awarded to the player based on how enemies were defeated - for example, a "Crush Bonus" for slamming an enemy into (and subsequently destroying) a piece of the environment, or a "Long Way Down Bonus" for sending an enemy flying off a cliff. These bonuses increase the player's Force Points, which work like experience points to level up; then once Level Up is achieved, the player receives Combo, Talent, and Ability spheres which can be spent on the aforementioned customization screen in order to gain new abilities and boost attack/defense-related stats. Additionally, the game makes use of an "Action camera" whenever enemies are defeated in particularly brutal ways, which briefly pauses the action to show an enemy hurtling to his death.<br><br>The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the Force Unleashed are the first games to use LucasArts' Ronin engine, which combines the Havok physics engine, Natural Motion's Euphoria AI, and Pixelux's Digital Molecular Matter (DMM), which allows enemies to react with fluid animation and self-preserving AI (such as grabbing on to ledges and dodging projectiles), and objects in the environment to bend, stretch and shatter based on their material properties. The versions for other versions simulate the effects, but do not actually include the modules.

Starkiller, Darth Vader's secret apprentice, was killed by Darth Sidious after betraying his former masters and joining with the enemy.  Or so it seemed. Force Unleashed 2 begins with Vader walking into a large room with a prison cell in the middle. In it, is none other than Starkiller himself. Suffering from visions of a woman's voice and a burning forest, Vader tells him that those are memories of a dead man, and that he is actually a clone of the original Starkiller. Vader gives him a test to strike down a few training droids and Starkiller abides, but when asked to take out one that looks like Juno Eclipse, his love interest in part one, he couldn't do it. Being told that he failed just like the rest of the clones, Starkiller unleashes a powerful force lightning attack and escapes. The clone then sets off on a mission, to not only discover the truth about whether if he is a clone, but to also find the whereabouts of Juno Eclipse.<br><br>In the game, the player controls Starkiller in his quest to get the answers he wants. This will take him to a number of famous planets in the Star Wars universe including Kamino, the watery world home to the cloning facility; and Dagobah, the swamp infested planet housing one particular exiled Jedi. Starkiller is equipped this time with powerful dual lightsabers. An improvement to the game allows Starkiller to actually dismember his enemies with his lightsaber, which can result in stormtroopers with no arms or even no head. All force powers from part one return with a new upgrade mechanic to go along. Using Experience Points gained from killed enemies, the player can upgrade any force power up to the maximum of 3 levels. This includes the new force power known as Mind Trick, which Starkiller can use to take over the mind of the Empire's forces and make them do things such as attack their own allies or even commit suicide by jumping off buildings.<br><br>Holocrons return in this sequel and are scattered throughout each level. Finding one can lead to an upgrade in health or force energy, new lightsaber colors/powers, or even a new costume to equip you with. There is also a Challenge mode where the player can participate in a series of 10 challenges ranging from time trials to gauntlet trials (fighting waves of enemies). The faster you do the challenges, the higher of a score you will get; with the lowest being a Bronze medal and the highest being a Platinum medal. Doing the challenges also help to get new achievements/trophies.

Stronger than anything mankind had ever seen they brought destruction and death upon the world. Whole cities where destroyed in just a few days and no end in sight. With no way to escape, the building of gigantic underground cryogenic sleep caverns began. Of course these caverns could only hold a privileged few and the rest was damned to stay on the surface, some starving to death, others going mad or killing each other.<br><br>But not everyone died.

Meanwhile, deep down under the surface, the Echelon awaken from their sleep with the goal to reclaim their old planet.<br><br>Stormrise is a real-time strategy game without base building and a unique point of view. Similar to Tom Clancy's EndWar the camera always follows a squad. But instead of using voice commands to switch between everyone, a technology called "Whip Select" comes into play. Holding a specific button down brings up a beam. Moving the beam over the symbol of one of the squads and letting go then changes the camera position to that squad and then allowing the player to order that unit around with the help of the 3D-target cursor.<br><br>Instead of building a base and producing units there, the player starts with a pre-defined group of units in single player lead by Echelon-Commander Geary and a warp gate in multiplayer.

Description=Street Fighter IV is the first main game in the fighting series, since the release of Street Fighter III in 1997, to up the main number in the game title. Produced by Yoshinori Ono, the game was launched following the positive response to Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting.<br><br>The game is chronologically set between the second and third main series and features a cast of well-known characters. The most important change is the visual style. Instead of choosing full 3D like the Tekken or Virtua Fighter series, SF IV stays true to it roots with stages on 2D planes. The characters are rendered in 3D with polygons similar to the Street Fighter EX series, but now with a hand-drawn touch of strokes and smudges, providing an effect of ink or paint in the visual design.<br><br>The gameplay is largely reminiscent of Super Street Fighter II Turbo and Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike with a six-button scheme for light, medium and heavy kicks and punches, throws, dashes, quick standing, combos and special moves. New to this game are Focus Attacks (Saving Systems in the Japanese version), based on two stances where an incoming attack can be absorbed and consequently countered. These attacks can be used to cancel out special moves, leading to new opportunities for combos and putting the emphasis into reading an opponent's move, rather than relying on strict combos. Regular special moves can be powered up through a super combo gauge. There is also a revenge gauge that is filled up by taking damage. When full, an ultra combo can be performed, with a long cinematic set of moves, often shown from a camera perspective that breaks away from the regular view.<br><br>Compared to the arcade version, the home version offers online multiplayer, new characters, both Japanese and English voice acting, animated introductions and endings for all characters, bonus stages, a new introduction, a challenge mode that introduces players to the basics, and downloadable content.<br><br>The set of playable characters includes:<br><br>1. Abel (new)<br>2. Akuma<br>3. Balrog<br>4. Blanka<br>5. Cammy<br>6. Chun-Li<br>7. Crimson Viper (new)<br>8. Dan<br>9. Dhalsim<br>10. E. Honda<br>11. El Fuerte (new)<br>12. Fei-Long<br>13. Gen<br>14.

Description=Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse is a 3D action/adventure game that turns the tables on the age old tradition of zombie games.  In this game, you play as the zombie, fight off the humans, and eat their brains.  Stubbs the Zombie is set in a retro-futuristic "city of the future", and follows Stubbs over the course of one day as he zombifies the entire city.<br><br>Before becoming a zombie Edward "Stubbs" Stubblefield was a traveling salesman in the 1930s who got himself killed.  Flash forward to 1959 where the world's richest man, Andrew Monday, has built his dream city, Punchbowl Pennsylvania, on top of poor Stubbs' grave.  Stubbs will have to claw through all of Punchbowl's citizens, including the local police department, crazy militiamen, nerdy scientists, and a deadly barbershop quartet.<br><br>Luckily Stubbs has some help.  Every human that he kills comes back as a zombie and joins Stubbs in his quest for brains.  Stubbs also learns a series of special "body" powers.  He can use his unholy flatulence to stun enemies, he can throw his pancreas as an exploding zombie grenade, and he can detach his own head and bowl it into enemies.  Stubbs' most powerful ability is that he can detach his hand and use it as a scout, climbing up walls and the ceiling, and then use it to take control of enemy humans and their weapons.

There are 47 levels to this game and the levels are split within 10 stages. As Supercow, you must dash through levels and collect various treasures and stomp on enemies to kill them. Naturally there will be enemies who will need a different tactic to defeat them such as the porcupines who will require you to have hyper-hoofs to be able to safely stomp on them. There are a few other power-ups within the levels such as a super jump and an invulnerability sphere. Naturally there are also health and life power-ups. <br><br>Besides the typical patrolling enemy the player will also need to be on the lookout for flying enemies such as birds, suspended enemies <br>such as spiders and of course traps and mechanisms of the levels themselves. Mechanisms such as giant blades will drop from a ceiling to cut the player and there are also a few pitfalls and flame-pits. To aid you through levels there are many jumps placed but of course these can be also detrimental if you are not careful where you are jumping up to. Also there are automated ramps and terrains of different properties such as icy levels. Some parts of the levels contain garbage bins and trash heaps which you can stomp to transform into flowers. <br><br>Not all levels require you to just find the exit, some require you find all the hidden keys or destroy all enemies. Defeating all the enemies of a level can also reward you with a trophy as will many other accomplishments which are prominently displayed in your in-game trophy room. <br><br>Controls are pretty basic in that you can run left or right and you can jump. The simplicity of this control scheme and the speediness <br>of the levels allows the player to feasibly play the game using a mouse by slightly pulling the mouse to either direction and clicking <br>to jump.

Description=Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix is a special version of the arcade game Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. Character sprites and backgrounds have been cleaned up, and gems have been given an element and a visual effect to go with that element.<br><br>The core gameplay itself remains the same as the original game: players place gems of different colors into their Tetris-like bin, as fast as they can, in groups of two.  The player also receives glowing coloured orbs - if they place these next to a gem of the same color, the orb and all identical colored gems shatter, and any gems above fall.  The player's goal is to make this happen multiple times for each block placed, causing 'combos'.  The larger the combo, the more Counter Gems (gems with timers on them) are dumped into the opponent's bin.  If a player places multiple gems of the same color in a square or rectangular order, they merge together to become a larger single gem which increases the amount of Counter Gems that drop on the opponent's field.  Occasionally, a player will also receive a diamond - placing this on a colored gem will eliminate all gems in the player's bin of that color, increasing the potential for combos even more.<br><br>Similar to Super Puzzle Fighter II X for Matching Service, HD Remix includes multiple variants of gameplay:<br><br>1. X-Mode: Identical to the original arcade mode.<br>2. Y-Mode: Same-colored gems break as soon as there are three aligned horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br>3. Z-Mode: Gems rise up from the bottom of the bin, and the player controls a 2x2 cursor to rotate them and create combos.<br><br>New to HD Remix is X'-Mode (or X Dash-Mode), which is a more fairly balanced version of the original game.  Many characters' special block patterns have been readjusted to level out the playing field.

Description=Supreme Commander 2 takes place 25 years after the events of Supreme Commander. The three opposing sides - the Cybran Nation, the Illuminates and the United Earth Federation - are still fighting in the Infinite War all across the galaxy, spreading chaos and unrest with the player right in the middle as the Supreme Commander.<br><br>As opposed to the first game, there's only one single player campaign during which the player will take over the control over the armies of each of the factions starting with the UEF-campaign as Commander Dominic "Migraine" Maddox followed by Commander Thalia Kael in the Illuminates-campaign and finally as Commander Ivan Brackman in the Cybran-campaign. But the game still is a real-time-strategy game in the vain of Total Annihilation featuring an insane amount of units on the huge battlefields at the same time. To keep track of everything, the player can seamlessly zoom out to a strategic map or zoom in until he's up close with his avatar, the mighty ACU. The ACU can construct buildings faster than the normal engineer and has access to powerful weapons in order to fight his enemies. But once the ACU has been destroyed, the mission or the multiplayer-match is lost.<br><br>Also different from the first game is the completely overhauled resource-management. This time around the player has to have the resources needed to build a unit or structure available upon giving the order instead of loosing them over time while the building is in progress. The resources themselves on the other hand haven't changed with mass and energy being needed to support the war-effort.<br><br>Each structure the player builds can now be upgraded with add-ons e.g. putting a shield around them in order to increase their defensive-abilities. In addition five tech-trees are available to unlock upgrades for the three types of units as well as buildings and the ACU which are also visible on the battlefield with a shimmering aura around units which have received the shield upgrade for example. The points needed for such a research are collected automatically although the rate at which they are earned can be increased by building a research-facility. Research will ultimately also give the players access to atomic weapons as well as powerful prototype structures and units including the UEF Flying Fortress or the Cybranasaurus Rex, a genetically modified reptile that has become the ultimate machine of destruction.<br><br>Besides the main campaign, the game features a skirmish-mode against the AI with three different victory conditions: only the destruction of the enemies ACU is needed, everything has to be destroyed or the Infinite War which features no victory conditions whatsoever. These conditions are also available in the multiplayer-mode for up to eight players.

Description=Switchball is a 3D strategy game where the player controls a marble through hazardous courses with different kinds of puzzles, with gameplay similar to Marble Madness or the more contemporary Ballance and Marble Blast. There are 5 worlds; Sky, Ice, Cave, Lava and Cloud, unlocked gradually and with different levels. Each narrow, winding course is played in mid-air and to complete a level the player has to guide the marble to the end where it boards a gyrocopter that transports it to the next course.<br><br>To solve the puzzles, the marble often needs to be rolled into Morphs that can switch the shape to four different balls: Marble, Metal, Air and Power, each with different abilities and characteristics. For instance, the Powerball can be charged in a generator, providing the ability to jump, dash, or magnetism. The Airball can be inflated with helium to reach higher areas. Supporting the AGEIA PhysX engine both through software and hardware, blocks can be pushed or topple down, cloth tears when the ball is too heavy and all kinds of items can be moved around. The nature of the puzzles changes with each game world, with fans, switches, and tubes.<br><br>The game is controlled through the mouse to move the ball, rotate and zoom. By holding down the left mouse button, the current speed is held to climb slopes or to move around without needing to move the mouse. Each level has gates that save the progress. When the ball drops down, the game is resumed for the last saved position. By completing courses quickly, players earn badges.

Description=Tales of Vesperia is the tenth game in the Tales of... series. The game's story takes place in the world of Terca Lumireis. This world is largely sustained by "blastia", a technology from an ancient civilization which can be used to perform a variety of tasks including powering the barriers which keep cities safe from monsters and helping knights in battle. After a war ten years ago, the world has settled into a more or less peaceful state consisting of the Empire which rules the land and various guilds which formed for those wishing to live outside the Empire's rule. The main character in the story is Yuri Lowell, a former Imperial Knight who now helps solve peoples problems in the lower quarter. After a blastia which regulates water flow in the lower quarter is stolen, Yuri attempts to catch the thief however ends up being thrown in jail instead. He then meets a mysterious girl named Estelle while escaping; she is coincidentally searching for Yuri's childhood friend Flynn, and from here their adventure begins.<br><br>The gameplay in Tales of Vesperia is similar to other Japanese RPG's and games in the series. The player controls Yuri as he explores various locations and the story unfolds. Often opponents (both human and monster!) can be seen on the screen and coming into contact will begin a battle. The battle system used is an updated variation from that in Tales of the Abyss. Battles are in real time and the player can move anywhere within the limited battle area. The player can run/walk, jump, guard, perform various basic attacks, utilize artes (more powerful magic attacks, however these are limited by the amount of the players technical points), and set the strategy computer controlled party members will use. Combo attacks are also possible where a series of normal and arte attacks are strung together to deal more damage to the enemy and prevent a counterattack. Successfully completing a battle allows players to level up. As players level up new skills are learned, attack abilities increase, hit points increase, and so on.

One hour after becoming sentient, it launches a nuclear barrage across the globe, striking key cities, destroying military assets and bringing mankind to the brink of destruction.  This day is known as Judgement Day.<br><br>Twelve years later, the survivors of Judgement Day are in desperate need of salvation as Skynet uses machines to hunt down and wipe out mankind.

Description=Texas Cheat 'em is a variant of the poker staple Texas Hold 'em, where, as the title suggests, players are allowed (and even encouraged) to cheat.<br><br>The underlying game follows all the rules of Hold 'em, and plays like a standard digital replication. Each round, players are awarded an amount of cheat points, which can then be spent on 15 tricks such as X-ray Vision (see another player's hidden cards), Card Suggestion (where you change one of your cards to another), or even something as blatant as stealing chips from another player.<br><br>To succeed at the cheat, the player must win a brief casino-themed mini-game, such as stopping a slot machine or roulette wheel at a specific target. For cheats where one player is directly affecting or attacking another (like stealing chips), the mini-game involves both players, such as rapidly tapping a button to make their horse cross the finish line first. If the player wins at the mini-game, the cheat is performed. If the player loses, the points are spent and nothing happens.<br><br>Players can play alone against the A.I., or online with up to eight players at a table. The player can use their Xbox Avatar to represent them in-game, or select from a variety of character portraits.

Description=This golfing simulation game is the 2007 multi-platform edition of Electronic Arts' Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise.  Although the game's features differ across platforms, most notably from next-gen to current-gen, it has a few things in common across the board: more licensed players, more courses, more game modes, and improved GameFace character creation.<br><br>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on Xbox 360 and PS3 feature more realistic characters thanks to the all-new Universal Capture (UCAP) technology. UCAP is the same technique that was used on The Matrix films to generate digital doubles for the lead actors. Another next-gen-only feature that the Xbox 360 and PS3 share is larger crowds and mass movement of spectators from hole-to-hole, as well as PIP cameras. There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.<br><br>PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods. The PC, PS2, and Xbox versions have the most licensed golfers (21) in the game. The Wii edition of the game features the ability to control your swing using the Wiimote.

Further customizations include clothing, hair or eye color and more. The initial statistics can be improved by completing challenges based on power or putting precision. They can also be raised by performing well in the PGA Tour, taking into account skill shots and not just the overall ranking. Players can unlock additional golfers and spend their winnings in the shop on new equipment.<br><br>The game incorporates the FedExCup championship format (a collection of tournaments) with rounds of golf at Westchester Country Club, TPC Boston, Cog Hill, and East Lake. The putt preview has been improved, allowing the player to simulate the ball's path once per individual spot, taking into accounts elements such as power, speed and elevation. On the Xbox 360 and the PS3, shots are not performed using the analog stick, but with the 3-point timed principle for start, power and accuracy. Shot Confidence is a new addition, keeping track of the player's performance on certain courses, for specific puts and using certain clubs. Great performances raise the confidence, which translates into experience and better performance on specific courses. Low confidence leads to lower accuracy, a pumping heartbeat, and rumbling controls on the Wii.<br><br>The multiplayer (up to 4 players) has been expanded with GamerNet, where players can create and play custom challenges with their scores posted online (Xbox 360/PS3/Windows).<br><br>On the Wii, players can shake the controls to taunt the opponents with 4 different moves, to throw them off.

Description=In the nearby future scientists develop a so-called Quantum suit that allows the carrier to travel through time. Two prototypes called Alpha and Betasuit are ready for testing when Aiden Krone enters the lab, steals the Alphasuit and makes a time-jump before he blows up the building. Luckily you were there and had the chance to jump into the Betasuit and activate the time travel before the building was destroyed. But it took the suit a second too long to jump so the explosion hit it and your jump didn't go as planned. When you wake up in an alley in the future you quickly realize that Krone has already declared himself leader of the world and transformed it into a totalitarian state with him as the dictator. Shortly after waking up, you are found by some rebels and you join their task in order to stop Krone and fix the timeline since your suit was too badly damaged by the blast.<br><br>Fight your way through hordes of enemies with futuristic, but also conventional weapons like pistols or shotguns. Your suit isn't rendered totally useless. It still allows you to slow down, rewind and forward time for a short period. This not only allows you to overcome obstacles like fire but you can also trick your enemies. Players can slow down the time and then steal the weapon out of the hand of an enemy - if he hasn't a too strong grip on it. This feature is also used for small time-related puzzles. <br><br>There are notable differences with the time manipulation element from the Prince of Persia series. Manipulating the time won't affect yourself and when you are too badly wounded and die, you can't just rewind. You remain dead and have to reload. The game also doesn't feature medipacks. Instead the hero just needs to rest for a second if he is wounded and will then be fully healed again.<br><br>Manipulating time is also part of the multiplayer-experience. Besides the normal game-modes Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, One-on-One and Capture the flag, the game also features King of Time and Meltdown Madness.<br><br>In King of Time there's a Time Sphere in the center of the map which makes you impervious to all time effects. To win the game you need to rack up kills while you have the item. Meltdown Madness instead requires of you to throw Chrono Grenades at the opposing team's machine to prevent it from functioning. Once a machine of a team has completed his countdown, that team wins.<br><br>The Chrono Grenades are also part of all the other game modes in addition to the Time Shield and the Time Resistance power-up. While the Chrono Grenades come in the three flavors and slow down, forward or rewind time in the area of the blast. The Time Shield not only makes you immune to time manipulation but also slows down every foreign object in a specific area which is good for dodging enemy fire. The Time Resistance power-up grants immunity against all time effects for a short period of time.

Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York.  A mysterious figure calling himself the "Nightwatcher" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan.  Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!<br><br>TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle.  Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights.  Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York.  Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.<br><br>Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you'll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on.  Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away.  If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack.  Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his 'rage' builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged.  The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses.<br><br>The basic goal for each level is to get to the end.  At the end of each level, you're graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected.  In levels where you work with your brothers, you'll also be graded on how well you worked together.  Succeed in a these attributes, and you'll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables.  If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you'll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins.  Finally, once you've played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect.

As a consequence, one year later America and Europe build a global missile defense network in space while Russia becomes the most important energy supplier and comes know the true promise of an economic boom making them once again a super power. Europe also units itself under the flag of the European Federation - but without the United Kingdom.<br><br>Now we write the year 2020 and the United States is almost finished building their Freedom Star, a orbital heavy weapons platform which once again will shift the balance of power on the planet and greatly increases the tension between the three super powers. It's only a matter of time until this tension unleashes itself in the last war mankind will ever fight: the EndWar.<br><br>Tom Clancy's EndWar is a real-time strategy game without base construction and single unit control. Instead the player orders squads of gunships, tanks and such around while being able to order reinforcements after a certain amount of time has passed. It is however wise for the player to look after his squads as they gain experience during the course of the battle and advance in six ranks after a successful battle making them more and more powerful. It is even possible to upgrade the units in the four categories "Attack", "Defense", "Mobility" and "Proficiency" with credits earned at the end of each mission.<br><br>What makes Tom Clancy's EndWar unique is the way how it is controlled. Instead of using a cursor, all actions are performed by voice command.<br><br>Each squad and hostile as well as important points on the map have numbers and letters assigned to them and the player uses these in combination of a few keywords to issue an order. If the player e.g. wants to send his first squad of gunships to attack the second squad of enemy infantry he has to press and hold a button to activate voice recognition, say "Unit 1 Attack Hostile 2" (in the English version) and release the button. If the system understood the order it is then carried out. It is also possible to issue a series of orders by completing the first order without releasing the button. The system will then await the following orders to be spoken before activating them all upon the release of the button.<br><br>To make it easier for the player to know what he can say, an onscreen pop-up window opens up as the player progresses through the command chain showing all possible words that can  be used in the current context.<br><br>During all this the camera always follows a squad. Freely moving around the battlefield is not possible. Instead the player jumps around with the command "Unit Number Camera" or activates the overview map called "Sitrep" which shows a abstract real-time map of the battlefield.<br><br>The single player campaign puts the player in control of all three armies while fighting battles all over the world against an unknown terrorist group. The game also features 1on1 and 2on2 skirmishes with bots, cooperative campaign play and a permanent online World War III-scenario in which thousands of players fight for world domination by joining one of the three factions and help conquering and defending points on the world map. These include air force bases which give access to air strikes and additional infantry units and capital cities that have to be conquered in three stages. Once a day a campaign-update rolls out which updates the map to reflect the territorial changes based on the battles fought in the last 24 hours.<br><br>As opposed to the the console-versions, the windows release also allows for control with mouse and keyboard, features an updated UI and camera and includes several new missions and multiplayer maps.

Description=Not even a day has fully passed since you rescued the US president from Mexican soil and you and the rest of your Ghost team are on the way home. Then the General phones in and gives you your next mission: a group of terrorists deposited two dirty bombs (normal blasting compositions combined with radioactive material) near the city of Juarez. Your goal as Captain Mitchell is to once again save the day with your three team mates.<br><br>Like in its predecessor Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter you see Captain Mitchell from behind while you command your team mates directly over the Cross-Com to fulfil your objectives like blowing up a bunch of anti-air-vehicles and then raiding a rebel outpost. To do so you have the normal Ghost team weaponry like the MR-C to your disposal which you can equip you and your team with before and at some points even during the missions. You also have access to a tactical map which allows you to see an aerial view of the current level.<br><br>The four multiplayer modes from the previous game are back: Co-op Campaign, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Hamburger Hill in which a team needs to hold a central zone of the map for a certain amount of time.<br><br>The PC version of the game was independently developed from the Xbox 360 version and is, besides the storyline, almost completely different and much more tactic-oriented. The 360 version is played from a third-person perspective and has a fewer multiplayer maps (and game modes). With the more action-based approach, there are no individual orders and a limited amount of team order (4 compared to 8 in the PC version). Players also cannot pick up enemy weapon or use stationary turrets. The game's planning phase is entirely linear, while in the PC version players can plan dynamic insertion points. There are less classes and the tactical map is limited, using wire-frame instead of a full 3D map.<br><br>Compared to the 360 version, the PS3 game supports the SIXAXIS control, and adds extra multiplayer maps, 8 new weapons in quick mission mode, and two new co-operative multiplayer modes.

Description=The year is 2014 and more and more countries begin to contract private military companies instead of their own armies to fulfil strategic objectives. Because of the increasing amount of competition between those companies for the best contracts, the fight even extends to the battlefield themselves. <br><br>David Crenshaw, a former US Navy pilot, is hired by such a PMC as the US Army sets him free after saving the Ghost Recon team during their operation in Juarez (Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2). Ordered to do a series of different aerial missions scattered all over the world, he soon realizes that he is getting sucked deeper and deeper into the war for global military domination in which he even engages in combat against his old employer. Becoming more than a simple mercenary, matters soon fall into his hands and his decisions will dictate the outcome of the war.<br><br>Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X is an action-oriented flight simulation similar to Blazing Angels 2: Secret Missions of WWII giving the player control over an airplane either in first- or third-person view. Set in a near-future scenario, the player has access to several different kinds of licensed planes ranging from real world aircraft like the A-10A Thunderbolt II to prototype machines like the F-15 Active used by the NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center. In addition, the player can choose a different weapon load-out for each plane before the start. Both the weapon load-outs and the airplanes are unlocked as the player advances in rank during the campaign. Each kill as well as completing objectives and challenges grant the player experience points to do so.<br><br>While the mission objectives range from defending Air Force One against enemy attacks to destroying ground targets, the challenges on the hand require the player to destroy 50 enemies only with his canon or get 300 aerial kills during the campaign. During the course of the game, the player will also get help from up to two other pilots who he can order to attack specific targets in his view. The on-board computer also helps by calculating optimal intercept or rocket evasion routes.<br><br>In addition to normal keyboard, mouse, gamepad and joystick-support, the game also features voice recognition, allowing the player to fire missiles or change the target just by shouting a keyword into the microphone.

Description=Like its predecessor Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown, Vegas is a more action-driven tactical shooter. You play as Logan Keller who is the leader of a Rainbow Six-Squad. Controlling two team-members, you have to take on terrorists who attempt to get the city of Las Vegas under their control.<br><br>The missions are all connected with one another through the storyline. You always have different goals like rescuing a hostage or disarming a bomb. To do so, you have access to different kinds of weapons from pistols to Assault Rifles and Gadgets like C4 or Tear Gas. You order your men around by aiming at something and then choosing from a list of options called "Rules of Engagement", available in a circle menu much like in Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter. They will then do they best to fulfill your order without risking their own lives by taking cover as often as possible.<br><br>Instead of a health indicator and medi-packs scattered around the map, your vision blurs when you get a hit. If you take too many, you die but if you take cover and wait a while, you recover and can once again take on the terrorists.<br><br>Compared to earlier versions, there are fewer enemies, but they are harder to kill due to the improved AI. The mission planning has been removed, for the first time weapons can be picked up from dead enemies, and the aiming system has been altered. The story is no longer told to cutscenes as the plot now advances through scenes during gameplay.<br><br>If you have saved Las Vegas or are tired of the AI, you can engage in the multiplayer-modes available for up to 15 other players like Assault & Defend, in which one team needs to take over an objective, defended by the other team, or just plain Deathmatch in the Sharpshooter mode. You can also play through the singleplayer story with friends or go on a hunt for terrorists on random generated maps.

Under the command of Team Leader Bishop a second squad cleared the backyards of the city while the other team enjoyed themselves in the casinos. The player takes control over Bishop and visits the other, dirty side of Las Vegas.<br><br>The gameplay hasn't changed since the first title so the game again puts four team mates at the player's side which he can give orders with the tactical interface including "Move to" or"Use Gadget". As he moves through the enemy infested areas, getting covered by his team, defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, two of the new features become evident: the Persistent Elite Creation (P.E.C.) and the Advanced Combat Enhancement Specialisation (ACES).<br><br>The P.E.C. allows the player to build a unique identity and save his progress from one match to another. Both in single and in multiplayer the player gains experience for killing bad guys and successfully completing objectives. Has he gained enough experience for the next rank, he will unlock new weapons, body armour and other more or less useful items. The ACES-system takes it a step further and rewards you a big chunk of experience and powerful weapons if the player completes challenges inside one of three categories: Marksman, Close Quarters and Assault. These challenges range from simply completing a specific Story Mode map to making a bunch of head shots in a row.

Description=Set in the not too distant future, Japan creates the Information Self-Defense Force (I-SDF). The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan's constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.<br><br>In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.<br><br>The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a &quot;tunnel&quot; like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.<br><br>Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.<br><br>The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.

Description=Sam Fisher is a broken man since the events in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent. He doesn't care about Third Echelon or even the American country anymore. The only driving force in his life left is his thirst for revenge. Revenge for the death of his daughter. One day a lead on the murderer takes him to Malta but before he can act, an old friend calls: Anna Grmsdttirm his old liaison officer. She unveils to Fisher that his daughter Sarah is still alive but of course it's not without a hidden agenda. So in order for Fisher to see his daughter again, he has to save America once again - but is Anna really telling the truth?<br><br>The player once again looks Sam Fisher over the shoulder while he makes his way through the levels in order to fulfill his objectives ranging from killing specific targets to blowing stuff up. As opposed to the previous installments of the series however, Sam prefers a more direct approach. While stealth and hiding in cover are still important parts of the gameplay, Sam doesn't care all that much about the lives of his enemies anymore and as such has thrown out most of his gadgets. So instead of avoiding the enemy, the player will mostly concentrate on how he can most efficiently take out the targets.<br><br>To help him with that, the player has access to a vast array of weaponry both with and without sound suppression including various types of grenades like frags, remote mines or a sticky camera which allows Sam once again to scout an area from afar, to entice enemies away or simply explode in their face. All weapons can be upgraded three times, increasing their power, range and accuracy using the points earned by completing objectives and fulfilling the so-called P.E.C. challenges. The P.E.C. challenges include stuff like killing five enemies with the "Death from Above"-move or with a silent headshot and such.<br><br>Each weapon also features the attribute "Marks". The player can mark as many enemies as the weapons allows with a grey arrow, making them visible even behind closed doors. But more importantly the marks are used for the new "Mark & Execute"-feature. Once Sam Fisher has performed a hand-to-hand takedown, the arrow above marked enemies in range of his current weapon turn red. The player then presses the execute button and Sam will kill all marked enemies in range in a slow-motion move, basically making it a instant kill.<br><br>If Sam is spotted by an enemy but manages to duck away, a ghost of Sam remains on his last position. With this, the place is marked where the enemy suspects Sam is hiding and while everyone's attention is on that spot, the player has time to plan his flanking move accordingly. In addition loud noises will once again distract the enemy and turn his back on Fisher.<br><br>Besides the single-player-experience, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction features an extensive multiplayer-mode for two player. The five available game-modes are:<br><br>1. Coop-Story - This campaign takes place before the events of the main game and puts the players in the shoes of the agents Archer (Third Echelon) and Kestrel (Voron) who have to recover four Russian EMP-weapons before they are sold on the black market.<br><br>2. Hunt - The players have to gradually clear the map from all enemies. If they are discovered, the difficulty level rises and additional enemies appear.<br><br>3. Last Stand - The players have to defend an EMP-generator against wave after wave of enemies.<br><br>4. Duel - The agent fight against each other as well as against AI-enemies. For each kill they earn points and the one with the most points wins the match.<br><br>5. Infiltration - The players have to infiltrate an area without being spotted.

Description=In Sam Fisher's first next generation adventure, the splinter cell has a tragedy befall him.  Shortly thereafter, Sam's life collapses around him.  He becomes more distant from Third Echelon.  In fact, he even goes so far as to get himself arrested.<br><br>But it's all part of the plan.  Sam Fisher is now a double agent, working for both the NSA and a terrorist organization known as the JBA, or John Brown's Army.  Sam is for the most part a good guy still.  But will that remain?  Will Sam do good for the NSA and bring the organization to justice, or will the lure of the terrorist group overpower and overcome Sam?<br><br>The choices you make affect that outcome.  Moral questions will pop up in various places throughout the game.  Do you shoot a prisoner to earn trust with the JBA, or do you hold off, keeping the NSA on your side?  Whatever outcome you decide on, your trust with one will go down and the other will go up.  This trust system is a new addition to Double Agent.<br><br>As you work your way through ten missions, your best friends are shadow and silence.  You can go in guns blazing, but you won't get far.  As a master spy, Sam will have to sneak around crates and walls, hide under vehicles and tables, sneak through highly guarded areas, and bypass electronic, fingerprint, voiceprint and retinal locked doors.  You must interrogate or hack for keycodes and combinations, and you have the choice of knocking an enemy unconscious or killing them.  When hanging by a rail, you can let an enemy guard walk by, or reach up, grab him and throw him to his death.  Your best weapon is your mouth.  Lure an enemy to your location by whistling, then sneak around him as he abandons his patrol to find the source of the noise.  Your configurable weapon is really a backup.<br><br>Sam will go on many missions as a double agent.  You'll be visiting the JBA headquarters in New York City, you'll travel to the Congo to rescue a soldier, you'll board a cruise ship in Cozumel wearing shorts in broad daylight with minimal cover, forcing you to change your stealth patterns.  You'll wind up in the middle of a wartorn city, in the middle of a battle between guerrillas and the military, both of which want you dead.  Your missions are varied, and all can be completed without firing a single bullet.<br><br>Multiplayer is similar to the past Splinter Cell games.  You take on the role of either a spy or a mercenary; spies are played from the standard, third-person perspective, while mercs are played from the first-person perspective.  Spies are tasked with stealing sensitive documents; mercs are tasked with killing the spies and protecting the documents.  Each side has its own unique weapons and items.  Spies do not have conventional weaponry, meaning nothing that can kill a merc, but they have several gadgets and devices to help them.  Mercs are blessed with a high-powered rifle, grenades, and the ability to toggle various vision modes.<br><br>The PS3 version includes some additional content: a new female spy character (multiplayer), two new maps based on a new environment (multiplayer), a new set of co-op challenges and some refinements for the existing content.

Description=Too Human is the first part of a planned trilogy of games. It mixes Norse mythology with cyborgs to recreate the myths and legends of old.  For centuries, the Norse cybernetic gods have waged war against Loki and his vast army of cybernetic monster that are bent on destroying all of mankind.  To combat these armies, a new breed of soldiers called the Aesir has protected the kingdom of Midgard from them, fighting alongside mankind in an effort to put an end to Loki.

Description=The third game in the Top Spin series updates the concept of the previous two tennis titles with some new features. The most important change is that more control is given back to the player, levelling the difficulty. In the previous version the AI took control of timing and positing, players only needed to press a button for shots, and keeping it pressed longer made them harder. In this edition the player controls the power of the shot, the positioning of the player and the timing needed to perform a successful swing. When the player needs to run to reach the ball, it will never be as precise as powerful as when already in position. Most of these changes are gradually introduced in the tennis school, where players are trained to become familiar with the new controls.<br><br>There are about twenty professional players, modelled after their real-like counterparts and with signature styles. Famous players such as Roger Federer and Justine Henin are present, along with a few legends such as Boris Becker, Bjrn Borg and Monica Seles. Not all legends are available at the same time for all three platforms (including Wii). An editor is included to design custom characters. There are dynamic weather changes and the players' costumes show traces of grass or dirt as the match progresses. In the same vein, the player faces show how they are sweating after playing for some time.<br><br>Next to regular matches, there is a full career mode where the player starts with very low statistics. These can be upgraded by training and playing matches, but they can never all be pushed to the maximum. Instead players need to choose to train for some powerful abilities or decide to become a more all-round player. This is mostly reflected in the amount of winners based on forehands or backhands for instance.<br><br>Along with quick matches, the world tour is also supported online. The world ranking starts over every fortnight and is not continued endlessly like the previous version. Some of the tournaments are the US Open, Australian Open en Roland Garros, but Wimbledon has not been included. There are various difficulty levels, six camera modes and the graphics are more detailed than the previous versions.

As Pterry the Pturtle (yes, like that), you must roll along the world, and collect the missing totems, as well as any treasures that you can find.<br><br>TotemBall is similar in gameplay to Katamari Damacy, in that you control a character that rolls along the ground by "pushing" the ball with your hands.  However, unlike Katamari, you actually hold your hands up, moving them up and down to control the speed and direction of the ball's movement.  The game uses the Xbox Live Vision camera to register your hand movements.<br><br>The main objective of the game is to collect the missing totems - these stack on top of Pterry as you collect them.  The more totems you pick up, the more of the song you will hear as you play the game.  The game also has plenty of collectables, such as gems and coins, which can be picked up to increase your score.  Treasure chests dot the landscape too, and these will add a x2 multiplier to your score.  For every treasure chest you collect, another 2 will be added to your multiplier, increasing the points you can earn.  Beds are also placed along the ground - if you pick up one of these, you'll be given the opportunity to rest your arms for a brief period.

There are 24 single player missions, and a multiplayer versus mode playable locally or online.<br><br>In single player, players earn money by destroying charging enemy units (from standard infantry to wheeled guns, and even enormous Tsar tanks). This money is then used to build new defenses on specific build pads, or to upgrade existing ones. As the match progresses, the number and type of enemies increase significantly. The hardest difficulty mode even removes A.I. control of the defenses, and requires the player to switch through and fire every one manually.<br><br>Defenses include barbed wire that slows down infantry, machine guns, mortars, artillery, and even poison gas turrets. At any time, the player may control any of these defenses personally, aiming and firing with increased accuracy and judgement as to which charging unit possesses the greatest threat.  Certain units also grant new behavior when under player control, such as the ability to manually guide mortar shells.  Players can also fly airplanes to engage enemy air forces, or take control of a sniper tower to pick off infantry from afar.<br><br>In versus mode, players must still build and maintain defenses to protect their toy box, but must also spend their funds on units to attack their opponent. Players select their next wave of units with the Y button, but cannot directly control their assault like they can with their defense towers.

Description=Trials HD is a commercial revamp of developer RedLynx's previous Trials web browser games.<br><br>Players control a stunt cyclist on a series of 35 linear 2-D tracks. In the standard mode, the player must guide their cyclist through tracks of increasing difficulty and improbability, with the only goal being to make it to the other side (with any stunt jumps or tricks simply being a way to pass obstacles).  12 extra "stunt" challenges have the player doing stunts for points or performing ridiculous feats like seeing how long they can ride atop a steel ball, or how many bones they can break by launching themselves down a mountain of shipping containers. Leaderboards track best times and points for all tracks on both game modes.<br><br>Trials HD's core gameplay is based around physics, which takes into account the rider's weight, speed, and the fact that any torque or traction is generated only by the bike's rear wheel. Jamming down on the throttle will likely result in the bike flipping over and crushing the rider.  Similarly, not distributing the rider's weight on a jump will make him land awkwardly and take a tumble. The game is thus less about racing, and more about control.<br><br>Using a combination of analogue throttle and brake (on the controller's triggers), the player must find exactly the right combinations, rider positions, and trick moves to pass each track.  Checkpoints are scattered throughout the track, usually before major trick sections. The game is designed around trial-and-error, and buttons instantly return the player to the last checkpoint or the start of the track after each fall; making it easy for players to get right back into the action.<br><br>The player is graded at the end of their run by time and the number of faults (restarts at checkpoints). Flawless runs are required to unlock gold medals, new tracks, and extra stunts. Unlocking medals also unlocks new bikes with different characteristics of speed and handling, whose appearance can be customized to a limited extent.<br><br>An edit mode further allows players to create their own tracks and share them with anyone in their friends list.

Most levels take place in futuristic environments such as sky cities and space stations. The player is given a choice of one of the two Trigger Hearts at the beginning of the game - Exelica, who emits a wide fan of weak shots, and Crueltear, who fires a narrowly concentrated barrage of projectiles. However, the firing pattern of guns matters little during the game, as Trigger Heart's most awesome weapon is common to both models, and is called the Anchor Shot. By using the Anchor Shot Trigger Hearts are able to grab, swing, use as a shield, and hurl back any flying enemy vehicle in the game, including even the most giant of enemy battle cruisers. When thrown, the enemy cuts a path of destruction across the entire screen, causing explosive chain reactions between adjacent ships and occasionally even obliterating bosses in one hit. The Anchor Shot is a tricky weapon to use, as it requires the player to circle the joystick in order to give enemy ships more inertia while continuing to dodge enemy fire. The trajectory of the released enemy is also somewhat difficult to predict. Another innovative feature of Trigger Heart Exelica is AI-adjusted boss difficulty level, which will cut more slack to the inexperienced player, while attempting to punish the pros.<br><br>In addition to the original Arcade mode the home version of the game includes a Story mode, which adds fully voiced cutscenes, additional endings and bosses throughout the game, and Arranged Mode, which is just like the arcade mode, but is limited to Normal difficulty, no continues, and only two lives, and serves as a challenge to the most experienced players.<br><br>The PS2 port includes a new opening movie, story mode and CG sequences.

Being more of a remake, than a real successor, the game once again gives the player full control over a banana republic in the Caribbean. To successfully live through his term in office, El Presidente needs to build a booming economy and keep his inhabitants happy as well as the USA and USSR.<br><br>Most of the city is built by the player himself including apartment buildings and streets. While some buildings need space to do their job (like farms), others need a road-connection or don't function without electricity. The only buildings that pop up automatically are homes of poor people. To build up his city, the player of course needs money. Money is earned several different ways. Every year the player gets foreign aid from the superpowers. Several times a year a tanker comes by and transports away export goods like oil (the new resource in Tropico 3) or bananas, also bringing money in. Another way to earn money is to make the island tourist friendly and rip them off while they are visiting. The least of the players income comes from his own people who pay lease, use the available entertainment program and such. How much everything costs is determined by the player. He is also responsible for employing from overseas, if the required expertise isn't yet available on his island which on the other hand enrages the Nationalists on the island. The Nationalists are one of the many groups of people the player needs to make happy besides each individual themselves.<br><br>In addition each citizen is his or her own entity, with their own names, relationships to other citizens, wants and desires. Some feel the need to excel in studies, others seek religious enlightenment, some just want to have a good time. They even take political affiliations and work towards those ends. The citizens do not blindly follow orders, they must be persuaded through meeting their desires, or just pure greed or terror meaning bribing them or putting out a contract on them. The latter is especially useful to keep the rebels at bay but if all fails and the rebels attack, the player's army as well as himself engage in an automatic battle until only one side stands. The game ends if the palace is blown up, the player doesn't get re-elected or the USA/USSR decide that El Presidente has become a pain in the butt. In addition the missions in the campaign feature objectives like have 150 tourists visit the island.<br><br>Besides the new 3D-engine, the biggest change in comparison to Tropico is the inclusion of a 3D-Avatar of the player inside the game. Generated at the beginning from scratch or by using one of the pre-existing characters like Fidel Castro, the avatar can be sent around the island, visiting production facilities or construction sites to temporarily increase the production and building speed. The avatar can also be send to the palace where he holds a speech and increases the freedom of the listing inhabitants.<br><br>The game features an editor that doesn't allow the player to create a new island, those are pre-defined or random generated, but instead allows him to build a new challenge with its own goals, events and difficulty-settings. These challenges can then be uploaded onto the Tropico 3-server and everyone can try and beat the current highscore on that map. No other multiplayer-mode is available.<br><br>The Steam edition contains some additional content:<br><br>1.

Description=Turok is a first-person shooter game set in the near future. There is no relationship with the previous games or the storyline from the comic books. The protagonist is Joseph Turok, a former Member of Wolf Pack (the enemy in this game), but now a Member of Whiskey Company. The mission that leads to the events of the game was simple: find Roland Kane (leader of Wolf Pack, and your former mentor) and bring him back to earth. However, things turned ugly, as the ship was hit by a missile and crashed on the back-water planet. Even worse, it becomes apparent that scientists from The Mendel Gruman Corporation have been terra-forming the planet for Excellerated Evolution, resulting in dinosaurs hunting you, your allies, and your enemy. Joesph Turok's mission is to survive at all costs.<br><br>Gameplay is about surviving in dangerous environments with both human soldiers and dinosaurs. The dinosaurs can be used as a tool to eliminate soldiers by luring them. All weapons have secondary functions such as a flares to lure dinos. Turok can also choose a stealthy approach with arrows and his trusty knife, in the form of brutal kills. Online multiplayer is also featured, with all the weapons from the single-player game, and some maps have dinos and giant scorpions. The gameplay modes include classics like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and all-new modes borrowed from objective-based war games, such as Assault Capture the flag, and co-op missions. They all have a little twist to them, such as CTF putting a lure on the "flag carrier" that draws dinos to the player.

Description=A long time ago, Aziraal, the god of war and leader of the hordes of Orcs, was slain in a huge battle. After this crushing defeat, the hordes were forced to withdraw to the southern wastelands. A thousands years later, the location of Aziraal's tomb is still unknown because the other gods did not dare to entrust this secret to any mortal. But one day a dwarven mining expedition discovers an ancient temple. The civilized races and the horde came to the same conclusion: in this temple lies the clue to Aziraal's burial ground. So the fragile peace between the two factions is at stake and a silent war has begun, preparing the holy crusade of the Orcs to find and revive their glorious leader. But behind the curtain a powerful force also weaves a secret plot to take the powers for itself.<br><br>In this mess steps a wandering bounty hunter - You - whose sister has been kidnapped by strange figures which demand for the sisters release that he finds several mysterious artifacts...<br><br>Two Worlds plays much like Gothic 3. You start in a small tutorial dungeon and after completing it, you are free to roam the big world - taking on side quests while completing your main goal. But you are not alone in the world and many animals or more human-like foes stand in your way. To deal with these enemies, there is the usual choice between magic, melee or ranged combat. You define what you want to be by distributing the skill and param points you gain at each level. The param points go into the four basics (dexterity, strength, vitality and willpower). The skill points are used for different attributes in six different categories (General, Magic, Combat passive, Combat active, Range passive and Range active).<br><br>As always, there are tons of items to discover in the world. They come in very different forms, ranging from weapons and armor to plants and artifacts. Plants can be used to brew potions but no recipes can be found in the world. You have to find all the useful combinations by yourself and then you can save your recipe to automatically brew that potion when you have collected the needed ingredients.<br><br>Since your inventory is limited, you can improve the weapons and armor you find on the fly. This is done by combining two identical items. Then you get a more powerful item. Then you can still add more of the same items on top, so even the weakest weapon can become very powerful. In terms of magic you use Boosters to make your basic spell more powerful.<br><br>Two Worlds also features combat while horse-back riding. Other features include teleporters all over the world, a combat system with a realistic hit system (if you swing your sword in a circle, you will hit every enemy in range) and NPCs with a day/night-cycle.

When hidden, she is surrounded by a purple aura that fades when she moves into the light or is spotted by an enemy. A special variant of bullet-time, called Morphine Mode, is explained as such that the real Violette is administered a dose of morphine by a nurse during those moments. Many different types of stealth kills can be performed, based on the weapons Violette is currently wielding. There are collectibles hidden throughout the levels that give experience points upon discovery, which can be used to boost player abilities.<br><br>Since the game takes place in a fantasy world of memories, the atmosphere and art style is purposefully contrasted and moody.

Description=Scarlett had a nice life up there in the mountains above Venice. Living in a small miner-village called San Pasquale and being in love with a future hero everything seemed possible. But in truth she never really fit in because of being an orphan of questionable heritage. When one day the village gets attacked by assassins because of her, this becomes more clear than ever. The village gets destroyed and Benedikt, her lover and said local hero, is killed. The next day, the survivors friendly but surely tell Scarlett to leave. Her goal: Venice where the so-called Undead Five threaten the cosmic balance.<br><br>Venetica is an action-orientated role-playing game with the player looking over Scarletts shoulder while traveling around the world. In it several typical role-playing-tasks await the player which are different quests, conversing with NPCs through multiple-choice dialogues, fighting many enemies and items and overall earning experience points to level up and learn new abilities. Quests and dialogues often present the player with decisions and actions that influence not only the overall story but in part also how the world around her reacts to Scarlett. Killing enemies with powerful combo-attacks to find better weapons and armor is instead pretty straight forward with Scarlett having access to four types of weapons and two skill-trees littered with active and passive talents. While swords and other blades as well as spears and shields are pretty straight forward. Hammers and axes allow Scarlett to destroy closed doors. The fourth weapon-type is the Moonblade. This legendary weapon is the only way to destroy undead creatures. In its basic form it's not the most powerful weapon, but there are ways to upgrade it. In addition killing someone with the Moonblade restores Scarlett's Shadowenergy.<br><br>Shadowenergy is needed for Scarlett's special gift: as the daughter of Death himself, she doesn't die that easily. If enough shadowenergy is available, she will instead rise again after a few seconds with half her hitpoints restored. But if not enough shadowenergy is available, the player can only go ahead and reload an old savegame. In addition of saving her from death, shadowenergy is also used to enter the Shadowworld for a short period of time. Not only is everything in the Shadowworld frozen, allowing Scarlett to escape her enemies or get behind her backs. By entering the Shadowworld, the player can also find portals and doors to areas otherwise hidden and inaccessible in the normal world. The player can also learn the ability Shadowpath to walk in and out of the Shadowworld at will.

Description=A remake of the original Atari arcade game Warlords, the Xbox Live Arcade release contains both an emulated version of the original arcade, and an updated version with advanced graphics. Both releases come in regular and "Throttle Monkey" flavors, where the speed is increased drastically.<br><br>In both versions, players defend the walls of their castle from one of the four corners of the game area. Fireballs are released and bounced around the game area. Players get direct control of a shield that moves along the outside of their castle wall, and can deflect or catch (and throw) the fireball. If the player misses with the shield, the fireball bounces off and breaks part of their castle wall. If the fireball eventually breaches the wall, the player is taken out of the game. Fireballs increase in number and speed until only one player's castle is left standing.<br><br>The original version features a historical style, with multicolored castles and dragons launching fireballs. The "evolved" version goes for a sci-fi/futuristic look with flashy particle effect fireballs and metal castles.<br><br>Players can play against the A.I. offline, or against three other players offline or online. Xbox Vision support is included, projecting players with cameras in the black "pillarboxed" areas on either side of the game screen.

Description=WarTech: Senko no Ronde is an action game which resembles a mix of a arcade style shooter and a projectile-based fighting game like Psychic Force or Virtual On. Played from a top down point of view, two players (or one player against the computer) pilot a mech in an arena with the goal of destroying the other player. Each fighter has available a variety of attacks and defenses, including a main attack, a secondary attack, the B.O.S.S. attack, and defense barriers. The main attack also has several variations which can be utilized by firing and dashing or firing and blocking at the same time.<br><br>The B.O.S.S. mode attacks require the use of energy on the charge gauge; when activated your mech becomes much larger and can execute several powerful attacks (this resembles the end of level bosses seen in many shooters). When in B.O.S.S. mode the gauge will rapidly deplete and when gone your fighter returns to the normal configuration. The higher the charge gauge level when B.O.S.S. mode is activated the longer you will be able to remain in that mode.<br><br>Each mech also has available an anti-field defense available when defending from a B.O.S.S. attack; this also uses up energy on the charge gauge, but will destroy any bullets near your mech. When beginning the game you can select from a number of different characters, each with different abilities affecting the speed, firepower, and defense characteristics of the mech. Several game play modes are available, including a story mode, score mode, and multiplayer modes.

Description=Way of the Samurai 3 follows the same principles as its predecessors and is once again designed to offer an authentic settings, a deep sword-fighting system, and cause-and-effect role-playing. This time around the game takes place during the Sengoku Period and puts the players into the sandals of a lone samurai. As the only survivor of an epic battle, he enters the world of Amana which is currently ruled by Shuzen Fujimori who had overthrown the former superior Lord Sakurai. But the Fujimori Clan isn't very liked in the region so Shuzen has to rule the area with an iron fist in order to keep control.<br><br>The player is thrown into this struggle and has to decide if he wants to join Fujimori Clan, Ouka Clan (formed by former members of the Sakurai Clan), protect the villagers in Takatana who just want peace or just get out of Amana for good (which will lead to a complete reset of the game). The game offers the player almost complete freedom to roam the eight zones of Amana while looking over the shoulder of his avatar. The overall story arc allows for over 20 possible endings. Which one the player gets, depends on his actions and choices throughout the game - including if he always bumps into people, making them angry and attack the player. To that end, the length of the game greatly varies depending on what the player does. The shortest way e.g. would be to just go and kill both faction leaders which can theoretically be done in less than an hour thanks to the ability to often even act during cut-scenes and dialogues. <br><br>While they play out and even during normal gameplay, the player has three choices: listen, apologise/beg or attack. Begging a merchant will earn the player a free item but will also greatly reduce the respect the merchant has for the player which in the end may lead to less Samurai Points after death or completion of the game. The game is divided into different scenes with the next possible ones marked on the in-game map, making it easier for the player to follow the red ribbon.<br><br>The game features a realistic day and night cycle which has a great affect on the NPCs who live their ordinary lives even without the player interfering. The player can talk to various characters, accept different jobs (only one at a time) and shop for new items. In addition are also a few mini-games like chopping up vegetables or fillet fish. Decisions influence the relationships with the different groups changing the way they interact with the player and there are dozens of swords, hammers and spears to choose with which he can defend himself. He has to to keep the variable quality and durability level in mind though. With these weapons, the player can perform both offensive and defensive moves depending on his fighting style, and even special actions. There are several dozen moves available for unlock which will even stay available for each new game. More importantly the player can decide if he wants to kill an person or fight with a blunt weapon. While killing can be bad for the reputation, throwing down an enemy only with a blunt attack will result in another meeting further down the road for sure. If the right weapon isn't dropped by an enemy, the player can go to the blacksmith and forge a new one out of spare parts or enhance and upgrade an existing one, according to his fighting style and in exchange for money. <br><br>During the course of the game, the player will also meet several possible partners. While some will join him in exchange for money, other can be "romanced". In any case the person will then follow the player around, giving him an additional edge in combat and also unlocking access to mini-games and side jobs which can only be done with two people. The romance with the partner can even go as far as the partner deciding to live with him in his home in Takatane village. There the player can sleep till a certain hour in order to restore his health and has access to a weapons safe as well as a closet where he can story his stuff as he can only carry three weapons at a time and no additional clothing.

Description=Rubi Melone calls herself a problem solver. Others would call her a mercenary. For enough money she does what she's told without asking questions and going over corpses to reach her goals. But one day a guy called Robert Pelham has the guts to double-cross her - a huge mistake. Mad as hell she goes out on a search for vengeance, traveling over several continents and going through hordes and hordes of minions. The whole game is envisioned like a Grindhouse movie with scratches all over the screen, missing scenes, a high amount of blood and gore and a high focus on staged action scenes.<br><br>Similar to John Woo presents Stranglehold, WET is a third-person-shooter with a strong focus on acrobatic stunts. While Rubi can kill enemies with her assortment of four different types of weapons (two pistols with unlimited ammo, two shotguns, two machine pistols and two crossbows) just by walking around shooting, she doesn't do much damage that way and is very slow. Instead she needs to jump around, slitter across the flow or walk on the walls which instantly slows down time until she touches the floor again. During these moves she can also use both of her weapons to target one enemy automatically while manually using the crosshair to target another. For every kill she makes she gets points and depending on how fast and how "stylish" she kills enemies, her points multiplier increases up to x5. The multiplier is especially important, since Rubi only regenerates health when her the multiplier is active, making her nearly invulnerable once she reaches and successfully holds x5. The only other way to regenerate health is to drink from whiskey bottles scattered around the levels. Earned points are used to buy new moves or upgrade existing ones as well as her weapons. She also has access to a sword which she uses as a door-opener and to cut down enemies in melee combat.<br><br>Besides the normal combat and the action/adventure-like climbing and jumping exercises in-between, there are simple quick-time events for bossfights and other scripted events and the so-called Rage-mode. At certain, pre-defined points in the game, Rubi kills an enemy at close range and gets blood all over her face. This drives her mad and turns the realistic graphics into a red-black-white cartoon-style world. During rage-mode, Rubi is nearly invulnerable, is faster and hits harder - but also has to deal with many many more enemies. Once the player has finished the game, additional difficulty settings are unlocked including an arcade-mode where each enemy can only take one bullet and Rubi also has considerably less health. In addition a points-mode, in which the player can select each level of the story-mode and try to beat his highscore, and Rubi's home are unlocked. At Rubi's home, an abandoned plane-graveyard, several different challenges await the player like getting from A to B in the fastest time possible, or shooting targets for points.

Milo is also an undercover-agent sent to Barcelona to infiltrate the local underworld but he soon finds himself between the fronts of an all-out gang war between three rival groups.<br><br>The player takes on the role of Milo Burik looking over his shoulder while freely walking and driving around the city. As a Wheelman Milo doesn't just drive his car or motorcycle he also uses them as a weapon. By swinging the mouse or using one of the sticks, the player rams his car into other cars until they go up in flames. It also allows him to quickly switch lanes or ram through barricades. By destroying other vehicles, speeding and generally reeking mayhem in the city, the player also fills up his focus power which is needed for special attacks. Utilizing this power allows him to get a speed boost, get perfect aim at high speeds or perform a 180 turn, aim and destroy his chaser with one shot. But his car isn't Milo's only weapon. Pistols, machine guns and such too await to be used outside and inside cars and if his own car is about to blow up or if he just doesn't like the color anymore, he can perform an air jack. An air jack is possible once Milo's car is close enough to another car or motorcycle. After releasing the corresponding button, he then jumps over, removes the original driver and continues on his journey in his new vehicle.<br><br>All this is used to advance in the main storyline as well as in the many side-missions the player can take on. These range from Taxi-missions in which the player needs to get a passenger to his goal as fast as he can, to rampages in which destruction is everything and capture and delivery missions in which Milo needs to use his air jack ability to steal a specific vehicle and get it to the drop point in time. In common have all that at the end the player is rated based on his performance with "S" being the highest rank and "C" the lowest. If the player managed to get at least an "A" he unlocks additional missions and ultimately access to additional repair shops and weapon depots. Once unlocked the next story mission as well as every side-activity can be accessed directly from the city map on the PDA.

Description=Wing Commander Arena is an Xbox Live arcade game based off the Wing Commander space combat franchise. The game is set in 2701 and the player is sent to the Frontier to destroy the remains of the Kilrathi Empire in decay. Unlike the other games in the series, Arena is much more action-oriented with a full focus on the dogfights in space, turning it into an arcade game.<br><br>There are 2 different game modes. In the multi-player mode up to 16 players can go free-for-all or play in teams. In one of the game modes, players can organize armadas to attack opposing capital ships. These ships are made up of 3 levels of defence. The player-controlled fighters need to defend their own main ship and attack the enemy capital ship at the same time. After breaking down one level of defence (usually consisting of missiles and turrets), a new level becomes visible, with the third being the bridge, after which the ship is blown up and the game is won. In another game type players defend their satellite in a capture-the-flag mode, or go one-on-one in duels. In the bearpit mode players can watch duels from the sidelines and play mini-games, or shoot at each other or inside the bearpit.<br><br>In the single-player mode, there are new ships to unlock through different modes: training levels, melee battles or missions where only asteroids need to be blown up. Players can choose from 18 ships (9 Terran Confederation and 9 Kilrathi), all of which are upgraded versions of ships appearing in earlier Wing Commander titles. Each race has 3 main ships: a light fighter (Arrow/Darket), a heavy fighter (Rapier/Dralthi) and a bomber (Broadsword/Paktahn), with different variations based on the upgrades changing the ships' design.<br><br>Unlike the previous games, the first-person perspective has been traded for a 3rd-person view on a 2D plane, with the third axis only for special maneuvers such as barrel rolls, flips, immelman turns, 180 turns and devices and moves only available for specific ships. There are 8 game maps, leaderboards and achievements. During gameplay, players can collect power-ups that restore the shield or fill up missiles, provide additional damage (hammer shot/cheap shot), or rare items causing wingmen to appear, energy absorption or supershields.

Himmler's Paranormal Division knows about the Veil and build several portals in Isenstadt to go from the real world to other, giving them an advantage in the battle over Isenstadt. But to enter the Veil, one needs a special medallion. Without it you turn into a monster once you leave the Veil. In addition the medallion grants it's wearer special powers. Of course the Office of Secret Actions can not allow the Nazis to get access to such powers and sends in their best agent: B. J. Blazkowicz. But although he manages to steal the medallion, the Nazis are already on the brink of being able to artificially create such a medallion in the lab. Of course B. J. can't let them succeed and joins the fight.<br><br>Wolfenstein is a 1st-person-shooter with the player shooting his way through hordes and hordes of different types of Nazis ranging from normal soldier to ninjas. To deal with his many enemies, the player has access to many typical WWII-weapons like the German MP40 or K98 rifle. In addition, during the course of the game he finds the medallion and learns four powers. While at first he can only enter the Veil which allows him so see enemies more clearly and use strange flying creatures as bombs, he's later able to slow down time, surround himself with a protecting shield or make himself stronger. But the medallion's powers can't be always used. Instead each of the powers drain it's energy which needs to be refilled at, in the real world almost invisible power-spots. After each mission, the player is free to roam Isenstadt, talk to NPCs to get new missions and visit the Black Market. Hidden in the levels for the player to find is Intelligence Material and gold in various forms. While the intel offers additional insides into the story and it's characters, the gold is used at the Black Market to buy new weapons, ammunition and weapons-upgrades like silencers or bigger clips. Both collecting intel and gold unlocks additional upgrades.<br><br>The game also features class-based multiplayer-modes for up to twelve players. The available classes are the soldier, who shoots first and asks questions later. The Engineer, who is the only one who can fulfill all the objectives.

Description=Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!<br><br>In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Fhrer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.<br><br>Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.<br><br>Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).<br><br>Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).

But one day the seeds of conflict rained from the sky and the entity known as The Dark, tried to take all the power for himself. The Light and The Dark battle fiercely but The Light couldn't defeat The Dark and stop the chaos. They were both inseparably connected to one another and so The Light realized that the only way to stop The Dark was to banish him and himself into two cursed artifacts. Each one is now guarding the artifact containing the powers of the other and all seems well. At least until one day a egocentric treasure hunter named Ayumi finds the map to the hidden temple where the artifacts are guarded.<br><br>In her greed she ignores the warnings of The Light, touches the artifact and by doing so unleashes The Curse upon herself. It enters her body and condemns her to pain and suffering. But not all is lost. The Curse hasn't full control over her yet. Withstanding it, Ayumi continues to search her search for the second artifact. But now not because of greed but to battle The Dark, confine it's powers again and relieve herself of The Curse by doing so.<br><br>The journey is not an easy one as the player takes over the control of Ayumi, looking over her shoulder and guiding her through the levels. The return of The Dark spawned many enemies on the island. But as an experienced treasure hunter, Ayumi isn't defenseless. With her gunblades in her hands, she mows through the enemies like Dante does in the Devil May Cry series until the entrance to the next level unlocks. Each defeated enemy then drops one or more souls which Ayumi needs to buy additional skills, spells and items allowing her to cast fireballs upon her enemies or buy more powerful bullets for the gunblades. This is especially important as all the enemies and bosses have different weaknesses. The phantoms e.g. are immune to physical damage but hitting them with a fireball or fire-induced blades will destroy them in no time.<br><br>Scattered around the temple are also artifacts which were broken into three pieces. If Ayumi finds all three, she reunites them and gains either a melee, pistol or airstrike upgrade increasing her respective damage and granting her access to more powerful combos.

Description=X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Uncaged Edition) is the release for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC and differs greatly from the version for Wii, PlayStation 2, PSP and NDS which is just called X-Men Origins: Wolverine.<br><br>The game follows the story of the movie of the same name detailing the background of Logan aka Wolverine before he joined the X-Men. Starting on the last mission of the elite military force known as Team X, the player witnesses Kayla's death, escapes from Weapon Factory X with his new reinforced skeleton and ultimately helps Wolverine to have his revenge on Victor Creed aka Sabretooth. In between dozens of enemies including a few boss fight require extensive use of the famous steel blades. Wolverine makes use of several different combos and finishers while slashing through his enemies converting his normal light and hard attacks into serious damage. Often it's even possible to incorporate the environment into the cause of death of an enemy by throwing him onto a spike or something similarly hurtful. The player has also access to four Fury Attacks. These attacks are very powerful but require rage in order to be executed. Rage on the other hand is collected simply by killing enemies. In addition the game makes use of Quick Time Events to unfold scripted cinematic sequences.<br><br>By killing enemies Logan gains experience points (including a multiplier if he defeats them in rapid succession) as well as by finding dog tags hidden on dead soldiers around the levels. Once he has gained enough experience Wolverine advances a level, gaining not only more health but also skill points. These can then be used to learn new combos or increase the strength of already known ones. Besides the dog tags, Wolverine's old suits from the comics are hidden in the levels. Finding all of them unlocks bonus challenges and allows the player to use the corresponding suit in the normal game.

Description=Yosumin is a tile matching puzzle game, where the player creates squares or rectangles with four identical tiles on the vertices. The main game screen shows a grid with several different shapes on each cell. The player has to click on a pair, by either selecting each tile or clicking and dragging from one to the other, to create a quadrilateral selection and make them disappear. All the tiles within the perimeter of the selected field become of the same type of the vertices tiles. Since the grid itself is a square, it is possible to remove all the tiles when every corner has an identical tile, in a move called "Yosumin!" by the game.<br><br>The main objective of most levels is to collect a number of specific tiles, shown on tabs at the left side of the screen, within a time limit. In the final levels of each stage, the goal is to collect a glass shard by creating a square/rectangle around it. Creating a set of twelve or more tiles gives a time boost, while making a sequence of squares with the same tile type removes it from the board.<br><br>Special tiles appear randomly on the board and give power-ups when collected. The Goldmin is a smiling gold square that can be used as a vertices tile for any combination, and gives extra time when collected. The Badmin is a black and spiky shape with an evil smile that shuffles all the other tiles. The Bigmin is a giant blue squiggly shape with a worried expression, taking the space of nine tiles. The Wingmin is an angry and red star-shaped tile with wings, that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the grid. The Plusmin is a smiling and cross-shaped yellow tile, that can remove a cross of tiles. The Bossmin is similar to the Badmin, a big and black mustached tile that takes the place of nine tiles and shuffles the whole grid.<br><br>The Windows version has two modes. In the Adventure Mode, a story is told between levels by cutscenes, describing a quest to recover the broken pieces of a stained glass shrine. There's no plot in the Endless Mode, only a succession of levels of increasing difficulty.<br><br>The Xbox 360 version also includes a Battle Mode which can be played online or locally, along with the Endless Mode.
