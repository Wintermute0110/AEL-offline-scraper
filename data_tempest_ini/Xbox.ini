Description=This is the console version of America's Army, the U.S. Army's free "recruitment tool" for the PC. As in the PC version, the single-player campaign of this console version simulates a soldier's true Army career from boot camp all the way to the Special Forces. Most of the game's missions involve real-world situations today, and the game uses authentic Army weapons and equipment.<br><br>Since the game was developed with the professional advice of actual Special Forces soldiers, the game is extremely realistic and forces you to follow authentic Army tactics. This makes the player feel as if they are truly on the battlefield, rather than just running around killing underpowered bad guys. If you use a run-'n-gun approach to the gameplay, you can easily get killed on the battlefield.<br><br>There are 2 major changes to this console version. The "build-a-soldier" feature allows you to fully customize your soldier by changing his name, nickname, face, and even his homestate. Experience points, which are earned at the end of each mission for performing well, can be spent improving your soldier's abilities.

Players control Captain William Adama as he participates in 15 missions leading up to the end of the First Cylon War.<br><br>Missions are tightly scripted. Players control three varieties of Viper fighters, as well as captured Cylon raiders, depending on the needs of the mission. Players also will man the stationary defense turrets on board the Galactica. Missions have clear goals, often with time limits, and are expressed and tracked through voiced radio chatter between wingmen and Galactica's war room.  Players are graded in a variety of areas after each level (including accuracy and keeping wingmen alive), and unlock upgrades and bonus material for high ratings.<br><br>Players control their craft from either a first or third person view. Fighters have unlimited ammo, missiles, and auto-repair any damage taken, but only if enough recharging energy is available. Firing weapons and using afterburners drain energy, and the fighter only repairs itself when the energy level is full.  Players must be aware of their energy usage to keep from running out at critical moments.<br><br>Missiles on every craft can also be configured on the fly through an option in the pause menu.  Pilots can program missiles to have increased power at the cost of speed, or increase maneuverability at the cost of blast radius.  This system allows players to adapt their missiles to the current needs of the mission, from swatting down formations of fighters to breaking through a capital ship's defenses.<br><br>Though it acts as a prequel to the new series, art and design is pulled from the original 1978 Battlestar Galactica.  The intro from the original series is used. Cylons Raiders, Colonial Vipers, and the Galactica itself use the original designs, Cylons themselves look like the original chrome toasters, and the reptilian race that created them (in the original series, not the reboot) make appearances.

Description=There are things in the world that humanity should not know about, and things it must be protected from. It is these things that the Brimstone Society hunts, and their newest agent for the cause is the half-vampire codenamed BloodRayne. Her mission will take her from clearing out the walking dead and man-sized insects in the swamps of Louisiana to hunting down members of the secretive Gegengheist Gruppe branch of the Nazi military around the world, as well as the monsters they unwittingly awakened.<br><br>Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and sub machine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appear to slow down.

Description=Racing a car is one thing, but racing into traffic at high speeds, where you are rewarded for the style of your crash, is another. This is the idea behind Burnout 2, which brings new modes and higher speeds compared to the original title. As usual, the aim is to speed around real life roadways, through the traffic ahead, while keeping all 4 wheels on the ground. <br><br>Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.  Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure.  Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie's streets.  As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races.  As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving.  Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter.  Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way.  The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!<br><br>Burnout 2 contains a full campaign and custom car campaign.  While you can unlock regular cars and tracks, later in the campaign you unlock more raceways like reverse tracks and one-way sprints.  You can unlock over 20 cars like a Nascar, a 1920's gangster car, a Japanese muscle, and many customized vehicles with custom paint jobs and upgraded stats.  <br><br>Along with the same sense of speed and highly detailed crash animations as before, Point of Impact packages new modes of play.  Pursuit mode has you playing the cop as you chase down the speeding motorists, and to win you must crash them out of the race.  Or you can reverse that with a friend.  You can flee from a friend while he attempts to chase you.  Crash mode, as the name suggests, forces you to glide into crowded intersections to get the most cars involved in a pile-up as possible.  The bigger the crash, the better.  Up to 4 players can compete for the best score.<br><br>Training and 2 player racing modes are also included.

Description=Detective Jack Walters arrived in Innsmouth to solve a case of a missing person. But soon he finds himself confronted with terrible mysteries older than humanity, and with ghosts of the mysterious events that led to his incarceration in a mental hospital years ago. <br><br>Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a first-person action-adventure survival horror game, based on the H.P. Lovecraft mythos and his short story "The Shadow Over Innsmouth". <br><br>Initially, CoC: DCotE plays like an adventure game, but soon it gains elements of a stealth game and of a first-person shooter. Notably, the game does not feature an on-screen HUD (not even a crosshair); Jack's health is hinted at by visual cues; as for ammo, you need to remember how much you have left before you'll have to reload. <br><br>The health system used in the game is uncommon. There is no "hit points" system; rather, Jack receives minor or major wounds in specific parts of the body, and if he breaks a leg he's slowed down. To heal himself and prevent death from bleeding out, Jack can pick up medikits which contain bandages, splints, sutures and antidotes, each of which is used to heal a specific type of wound. Ill effects emerging from the wounds can be temporarily suppressed with a fix of morphine. <br><br>Jack's sanity also plays an important role. When Jack looks at disturbing things or finds himself in alarming conditions, his vision blurs, he begins hearing voices and talking to himself. If this gets too bad, Jack may go insane or commit suicide. Also, Jack suffers from acrophobia, and looking down in high places will cause him vertigo.

Description=The third main Call of Duty game centers around Operation Cobra in Normandy, France, the World War II operation planned by United States Army General Omar Bradley to break out from the Normandy area after the previous month's D-Day landings. You play as 4 allied sides with American, Canadian, British and Polish soldiers in 14 chronological singleplayer missions covering the 88 days leading up to the liberation of Paris. Surprisingly, you cannot play as the French 2nd Armored Division that actually liberated Paris.<br><br>The battles are usually dramatic with many fights and scripted events at the same time, consisting of infantry and vehicles, with semi-destructible environments. In between, there are cinematics that explain the events. A few gameplay mechanics have been kept intact or make a return: slight auto aim, the damage system that allows you to recover if you hide for a moment, and smoke grenades. New features include the ability to toss back unexploded grenades and actions requiring a successful series of button combinations. This can occur in hand-to-hand combat where you can yank the weapon out of enemy soldiers' hands. Enemies work in groups, try different tactics and search for cover.<br><br>The main multiplayer modes are standard deathmatch (battle), team deathmatch (team battle), Capture the Flag (either with two flags or two sides trying to control a single, neutral flag) and Headquarters (two sides either defend or attack a structure, and players can now respawn after dying). The new mode, War, is similar to the gameplay of the Battlefield series. Two teams start with two control points each, and one neutral flag in the middle. The objective is to control all five flags.<br><br>There are multiple-occupancy vehicles (Sherman Tank, Panzer IV, Jeep, Horch, BMW, Harley), and several multiplayer classes: Rifleman, Heavy Assault, Light Assault, Medic, Scout, Support and Anti-Armor. Each class has unique abilities. There are also two rankings: a normal rank system during a single game where your abilities improve if you do well, and an overall TrueSkill ranking. Also, unlike the previous games, your team stays grouped together after a match and is not booted back to the lobby right away.

These conspirators want  to stop you from uncovering their plans, and also get revenge for a previous news story in which you exposed a KGB operation in Berlin. To get you out of the way, they have switched your ordinary camera for one incorporating a cunning X-ray weapon, and have framed you as a CIA assassin who wanted to kill General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev (who, in the game, is somewhat incorrectly referred to as the "president" -- even though no such office existed at the time).

You must work with him to stop the KGB radicals from overthrowing the government, and to prove that you are both innocent.<br><br>Cold War's gameplay is based on stealth, similar to games like Splinter Cell or Dark Project. Being a journalist you are no weapons expert, so you should try to be stealthy and attack only when necessary.

Description=Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set some time after Warped: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex).<br><br>The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.

Description=Having already freed Hong Kong from the grip of the Yakuza in their last game, the Dragons of the Hong Kong Police Force fly to America to hand Tiger Takagi off to the CIA. Unfortunately Takagi is barely on American soil for five minutes before his Yakuza cronies spring him, and this time it's up to the Dragons alone to put him behind bars for good.<br><br>Double S.T.E.A.L: The Second Clash has the same reckless vehicular smashing action of the first game, but this time set in the American city of Chicago. Missions can have varied objectives such as destroying a number of Yakuza targets or getting to a point in the city while being hounded by Yakuza cars. Missions have far more generous time limits compared to the first game, but they are also now rated, and earning a high rating on a mission with a quick time can unlock Extra Missions and cars. Most cars can earn multiple turbo boosts by destroying property and traffic, and if the boost bar is maxed out then it will be expelled all at once and stop time as well.<br><br>The free mode of the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions of Wreckless makes a return, allowing Madoka and Mei to drive around the city without worrying about objectives or time limits. Boxes of car parts can be found hidden around Chicago, and for every five boxes found a new car will be unlocked. Extra Missions can be found as well that have non-Yakuza related objectives, such as winning a dirt race, reaching checkpoints, or delivering pizza in time.

The game still has a GTA-style open-ended design, though, and you can still exit your vehicle for some on-foot action. However, there's no reason to exit your vehicle unless it's damaged and you can no longer drive it, as almost all of the game's missions involve cop car chases. If that's the case, then you can either go to the repair shop to repair your vehicle, or just steal someone else's vehicle! Until then, you can punch the cops with your fists and steal their weapons when they're dead, so that you can use them for future on-foot combat.<br><br>The game takes place in both 1978 (before TK went to prison) and in 2006. The 2006 setting has a much more modern soundtrack than the 1978 setting, which has a mostly disco soundtrack. Obviously, the 2006 setting has the architecture, technology, and cars of today.

Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win.

Weapons and items are dropped randomly from boxes in levels as well as from defeated enemy generals, and each has a range of stats dependent on the difficulty level and the strength of the general. The most powerful weapons and items, however, can only be collected by completing hidden objectives as each character. Characters grow more powerful by collecting stat up items from defeated generals, and doing well in levels rewards points that level up the bodyguards who follow the player character.<br><br>Most completed levels can be replayed with any character and any side in free mode.

After being released from a prison ship at the shores of the island Vvardenfell, Morrowind heroes may do more or less what they want: follow the main quest and solve the mystery of an ancient prophecy, join any of roughly a dozen guilds and rise in their hierarchy by performing duties, or simply explore the gigantic island with its very individual cities, hundreds of dungeons and tombs, ancient ruins and mighty fortresses. <br><br>Morrowind uses a two-stage skill system. Your heros primary stats (strength etc.) increase with each level gained, secondary abilities improve by use  the more often you jump, the more proficient you become in the »Acrobatics« skill. The real-time fights are simple exchanges of strikes or spells, until one combatant dies. The enemy's condition (How wounded is he?) was not originally shown, however, at the request of customers a health bar was added for enemies as part of the first upgrade patch.<br><br>Your race and gender, but also your reputation influence the reactions of NPCs. If a characters sympathy for you is low (rated on a scale from 1 to 100), he might refuse to answer your questions; if it is high, youll get more detailed information and better bargains in shops. Most quests involving other persons can be solved by persuasion, pick pocketing, or simply by force.<br><br>Morrowinds NDL 3D game engine is powerful in drawing wide, detailed outdoor landscapes as well as complex indoor environments. Transitions are not fluent; houses and dungeons must be loaded upon entering.

Laying beside the body of his dead father, the boy is attacked by a band...fortunately saved by the hero called Maze.<br><br>He is then taken to the Heroes Guild where he is raised. Time has passed and the child has grown, and is ready to take up his own quest to rid the land of monsters and discover whom was responsible for the deaths of his family and village.<br><br>Fable is a 3rd person RPG that casts the player as "the child" or "the hero" who must perform various deeds to graduate from the Heroes Guild and define themselves. Generating a new character, players will go through the Guild's training, and become an adult, thrown into the world to make one's own decisions.<br><br>The story progresses when the hero chooses "main quest items" from the Guild. Alternatively there are also other quests that the player may complete in order to obtain gold and fame. Some quests allow the hero to "boast" in front of his fans. Boasting before a quests adds added difficulty, such as "completing the quest naked," however will allow additional gold and fame to be obtained. <br><br>The game introduces a "good and evil system", similar to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Various situations, for example coming across a child being bullied, will force the player to make decisions which ultimately shape their character. <br><br>Making decisions deemed "good" and morale earns the player good points, while being selfish and "bad" earns evil points instead. These decisions not only alter character stats, but also the hero's appearance and even the environment around them.<br><br>"Evil" characters tend to look the part; growing horns, receiving scars and having a swarm of flies buzzing around him. A "good" character on the other hand might receive a halo and have butterflies swarming. However other actions such as receiving wounds in combat or casting large amounts of magic also affect the player's appearance. Actions also end up impacting the player's reputation, including actions that might be relatively unimportant in other games.  For instance, if a player kicks a lot of chickens, various people might start referring to them by the title of "Chicken Chaser" or using "good alignment" magic might cause people to start calling the hero "Runemaster" instead.<br><br>There are three main modes of combat in Fable: melee, ranged and magic. The Hero can equip any number of weapons, from swords to axes, and a variety of spells to either harm or help. What the hero wears also determines how people interact with them. Bright, saintly armor tends to make townspeople more willing to talk, while carrying a large axe and blood-red, darkened armor, might cause them to be more apprehensive.<br><br>An experience upgrade system allows players to specialize in one area, or spread throughout, to give the hero a more all-around set of abilities. There are three areas in which experience is gained: Physical, Skill and Will. <br><br>Physical experience is earned primarily by using melee weapons and can be used to upgrade the hero's strength or health. Skill experience is primarily gained through archery or trading and boosts archery prowess, speed or guile. Will experience is gained through magic usage and is spent on new spells or upgrading old ones.

Description=This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie "Fantastic 4". Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay.<br><br>Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka "Doctor Doom" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few.<br><br>The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials.<br><br>To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.

Description=Far Cry Instincts is an Xbox remake of the original Far Cry PC shooter, but with many changes and enhancements by Ubisoft Montreal, who collaborated with Crytek on this title. The main storyline has not been changed: you are still the charter-boat businessman Jack Carver, who is suddenly attacked while escorting journalist Valerie Cortez to a tropical island. While rescuing Valerie, you get revenge on the soldiers and scientists, and investigate the strange events on the island.<br><br>The Xbox version is true to the original, but adds small twists to the plot (already in the opening scenes) and enhances the game with new gameplay elements. Jack has both offensive and defensive attacks. He can use boats, gliders, water scooters, ATV's and even a hovercraft to move around, and the weapons range from a butterfly knife to rocket launchers. While sneaking, you can use backstab, or branch whips and claymore mines as traps.<br><br>New gameplay elements for the Xbox version are introduced when you are injected by doctor Richard Crowe. His serum gives you predator-like abilities. By killing enemies, resting, or taking physical damage, an adrenaline meter is filled, which can be used to activate feral abilities that enhance your instincts (hence the title) such as feral speed (extreme movement), feral vision (much like night vision), feral smell (trace enemies by odour) and feral strength to blast through doors.<br><br>There are extensive multiplayer options, from split-screen behind a single console to system link with up to 16 consoles connected. Also on Xbox Live, the following modes are available:<br><br>1. Chaos: FFA with a fraglimit.<br><br>2. Team Chaos: TDM with a fraglimit.<br><br>3. Steal the Sample: CTF where the player carrying the stolen sample cannot shoot, but is allowed to toss it to a team mate and then use a weapon.<br><br>4. Predator: Predators versus a group of mercenaries. The mercs need to activate a transmitter triggering a sonic alarm that kills the creatures. The predators on the other hand (no more than two per game) have a complete set of skills including feral abilities, regeneration and unlimited respawns, while the mercs remain dead when killed.<br><br>A map editor has been included as well. You can create, edit and save maps, and then share them with friends.

Unfortunately, they never returned from their investigation. Miku enters the mansion, armed with only an antique camera given to her by her deceased mother, to try to find her brother.<br><br>While inside the mansion, Miku will encounter ghosts and other spiritual apparitions.  In order to overcome these spirits and survive, she must use the magical camera to capture the ghosts on film, thereby trapping them forever. Ghosts range from invisible fragments hidden in scenery, to memories of the past that appear only for a moment before vanishing, to full body apparitions that will attempt to attack and kill Miku.<br><br>In order to defeat an aggressive ghost the Camera Obscura's shot must first be "charged" by keeping the ghost centered while it is visible.

Description=Featuring a brand new engine (replacing the one used in five titles since FIFA 2003), FIFA 06 features new controls and gameplay, the most visible being more animations and better detailed ball and player physics and animation, the removal of the unpopular Off the Ball controls implemented in their 2004 version and remaking the free-kick interface so it's no longer obvious if the player decided for a shot on goal or a pass to a forward. Also new is the concept of "Team Chemistry"  which affects how well a team plays collectively. <br><br>Featuring 26 leagues from 19 countries, 29 real stadiums and over 10'000 players with data for the 2005-06 seasons, as well as international teams, the game kept the "Create a player" feature as well as the many managing options untouched from previous versions. Career mode, the 15-year long climb to the top of the game, features new options such as sponsorships (which will only accept good results), player contracts and more weight on the player morale: a demoralized player (usually from not playing or possible influence from random events) is more likely to under-perform as well as pressuring the "Team Chemistry" values downwards and might refuse attempts to renew his contract, leaving on a free transfer.<br><br>While there are still many unlockables in the game (mostly third kits), the way to earn points changed. Instead of gaining points from completing tasks (from entering the EA Trax or creating a player to winning the Champions League or completing a career), the player has over 100 scenarios to way in five difficulty levels.

Over 510 teams are accurately represented in the game. 27 leagues from 20 nations are included, along a "Rest of the World" for the best teams in championships left outside the game and international teams. Spain, England (with two), France, Germany and Italy also feature second divisions. Players can also create two clubs, customizing their badge, kits and home stadium, selecting players from anywhere in the game, along the starting budget in manager mode. The player creation tool remains mostly unchanged, with the ability to customize everything, from faces  (with a complete set of options, from jaw width to eyebrow shape) to the appearance and playing abilities.<br><br>While the focus of this yearly update was on the game engine, the Manager mode was also enhanced: players now also improve their playing ability from being active members of the squad, forcing the player to choose between keeping his celebrated stars near retirement in the starting eleven, or give the benefits of the youth system a chance to shine. Another new feature, in what is now the primary mode of the series, is the ability to watch the game in a simplified text mode, with the ability to jump into action to turn the events still available. The points system was replaced by a less abstract currency model (with the ability to choose between Pounds, Euros or Dollars). Other game modes include Tournaments (including the creation of custom tournaments) and Challenges. By completing challenges (similar to the Global Challenges mode in World Cup 2006) the player can spend points in the Fanshop with items such as new teams, a special overhead camera, new balls from Adidas (including all original World Cup balls from 1974 to 2002), stadiums, third kits and special celebrations for created players.<br><br>Finally, online gaming received a new mode: Interactive Leagues. These are online-only leagues based on the fixtures of their real counterparts (English Premier League, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga and Mexican 1st division). Then, online players go head -to-head with their favorite teams with a victory counting one vote for their favorite team. Once the week is over, the team with more votes is declared the winner of the week, getting three points. The number of weekly matches a player can do in this mode is unlimited.

Description=This action-orientated game takes you through 18 missions taking place throughout the WWII. Six Missions per side (Americans, Russians and Germans) place you inside a tank from the corresponding period (for example, in the first mission of the game you drive the famous German Panzer II Ausf. C). <br><br>Your tank is equipped with a cannon with limited ammo and a MG with unlimited ammo. With this arsenal you now have to complete different objectives (which can change throughout the mission) inside the missions like blowing up a fuel depot. In this process you also destroy and blow up many other things in the almost completely destroyable environment (from trees to houses) and of course you've to fight against enemy infantry and tanks.<br><br>The game also gives you command over a squad of friendly tanks which you can give simple but effective commands like 'make a flank attack on that position' or 'go and repair yourself at this repairstation'.<br><br>The mission-briefing consists of original WWII film footage where a speaker explains different aspects of the tank-war and a text (read to you) in which the story of your tank-crew is explained.

Description=FlatOut is a driving game where crashing your car can be more fun than racing it.  You drive muscle cars around dirt tracks, battle them on destruction derby arenas, and take part in Ragdoll Olympics.  That last one may need some explanation.  When you crash in FlatOut, your driver (the Ragdoll) is flung through the windscreen, very much like in Rekkaturvat.  This feature is used in the Ragdoll sports where the task is to propel the hapless driver as far, as high, or as accurately as possible.  On the demolition arena the goal is to wreck other cars before yours is.  Simple as that.<br><br>The bulk of the game is racing though and it can be performed in typical quick race and time trial modes in addition to the proverbial career mode.  There are also two different handling modes for the cars.  Normal mode gives arcade type handling, suitable for gamepads.  Professional mode seems to be designed for steering wheel owners and provides very challenging simulator-type handling.  Not surprisingly since Bugbear's previous racing title Rally Trophy was considered to be very challenging, even demanding, simulation.<br><br>Bugbear's experience with simulation dynamics shows in FlatOut.  Almost everything on the track can be run into and it behaves as it should in real life.  Or at least as in a car-chase movie.  Stuff that cars scatter around are there on the next lap too and cars are gradually dismantled when hit to other cars or solid objects around the track.<br><br>Multiplayer modes are of course great party hits.  Depending on platform, FlatOut has hotseat, split screen, LAN, and/or online multiplay modes.

Every class is also divided into 3 levels. You begin your career in the derby class level 1. Here you drive old, wrecked cars straight from the dump. As you progress to the race class and finally to the street class you can buy better and faster cars which you can then also tune to your needs, like installing a new engine.<br><br>Inside the classes you find different kinds of events: from normal races over Destruction Derbies to stunt events. All of the events feature a fully destructible environment. This is not only eye-candy but is also required to fill up your nitro and handicap your enemies.<br><br>If you get bored of that, you can play one of the 12 mini-games. Like in FlatOut your goal here is to do all kinds of crazy stuff with your driver. You can use him as a football, throw him through burning rings and more. These mini-games can also be played with up to 8 players on one PC in a hot-seat mode.

Description=Ford Bold Moves Street Racing is the third Razorworks-developed title in the licensed Ford Racing series since they took over development in Ford Racing 2. Unlike its predecessors, this version has an urban atmosphere. The road races, off-road challenges and circuit tracks have been removed and the action has been taken entirely to the streets of Los Angeles, with 24 tracks available. As in the previous version, the 18 available cars are all Fords, ranging from the 1968 Mustang GT to the 2007 Shelby GT 500.<br><br>There are 4 main modes: Quick Race, Team Racing, Solo Racing and Multiplayer. Solo Racing offers quick races, and championships where new vehicles and tracks can be unlocked. The real novelty is the Team Racing mode, split up in single races, team championships, challenges and tutorials. Team Racing has the player control two or three vehicles in a single team during a race in modes such as Race, Elimination or Duel. The team with the highest point total wins, so the player either has to switch between the vehicles to drive (the others cars then become AI-controlled) or issue orders such as Block (slow down another vehicle) or Draft (additional speed in the slipstream) to influence the driving behaviour of the team mates. This can be extended to double or even triple actions of the same effect. Blocked cars have to brake and weave across the track until they regain control.<br><br>Racing or completing challenges earns credits, which can be spent to buy new vehicles in the showroom. Despite the urban theme, there are no tuning options. Cars can only be viewed, repaired and sold. <br><br>The PSP version adds 6 new Ford cars (1962 Thunderbird Sports Roadster, 1971 Mustang Mach 1, 2004 Bronco Concept, 2005 Shelby GR-1 Concept, 2005 SVT Sport Trac Adrenalin Concept, 2005 Thunderbird) and 7 new tracks. In the Team Racing mode, two cars can be controlled (3 in the console versions) and solo and team multiplayer is supported over Wi-Fi.<br><br>There is also an alternate Australian PS2 release Ford Street Racing (XR Edition), with 4 additional cars synonymous with the history of Ford in Australia: the 1970 Ford XY GT Falcon, the 1970 Ford XY GTHO Falcon (Phase III), the 2003 Falcon XR8 Ute and the Australian Falcon XR8. That version is also the only PSP version released in Australia.

Like in most other games of this kind, most of the gameplay is dedicated to jumping and climbing, with some combat thrown it. However, Galleon includes many less typical elements. Rhama possesses extraordinary acrobatic skills and can run on walls and perform very long jumps. The game has an unusual control scheme, which makes Rhama respond to the amount of pressure the player applies to the analog stick, allowing various and precise combinations of running and jumping, including the possibility to influence character movement during free fall. <br><br>Further stand-out features include co-operation between characters (similarly to  ICO, though Rhama has two female companions), treasure hunt system (Rhama can use his pirate senses to discover hidden treasures), and boss battles that require climbing on the enemies to destroy them,  Shadow of the Colossus-style.

Description=A port of the arcade game, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. <br><br>This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.<br><br>There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes. <br><br>Unlike the early Gauntlet arcade games, the camera angle varies from location to location, from bird's eye to nearly ground level. The lands, creatures, and heroes are all rendered in 3D. While the graphics have been upgraded, the game play is very similar. You basically run around levels, hacking at what seems like unlimited armies of monsters, searching for gold, keys, and health-giving food...as well as a way out of the level. Bosses and other scripted events slow down the repetitious nature of the originals.<br><br>While levels can be gained and characters saved, Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is an action game with some RPG trappings and should not be confused with the more true types from that genre.

Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done.<br><br>This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks.<br><br>Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold.<br><br>The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together.<br><br>The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature.

Description=Ghost Master: The Gravenville Chronicles is the console version of the PC game Ghost Master. In this strategy game, you become the scourge of humanity by managing haunting teams consisting of various ghosts. The levels, usually inspired by famous scenes from horror movies, require you to scare mortals and complete additional objectives such as freeing trapped ghosts. Deployed ghosts need to be bound to certain objects, called fetters, that match their type.<br><br>By scaring humans, you collect plasm, the main resource in the game. Plasm can be used to recruit new ghosts, or expand their abilities. Rather than deploying a massive amount of creatures, the game rewards creative use of limited resources to haunt mortals in original ways. Each human has a believe meter. An important aspect is figuring out each human's weakness. As you exploit this, they become more susceptible to various phenomena and provide more plasm. Along the way, you will meet fierce resistance as ghostbreakers, priests and witches can detect and ban your ghosts.<br><br>The game is not a direct port. Instead, Spiral House was contracted to modify the original codebase by Sick Puppies to make it more user-friendly for the consoles. This includes a complete overhaul of the interface to make commands easier to access, the introduction of battle elements - next to the regular missions - to speed up the game's pace, a more linear game structure, and a redesign of the control over ghosts. They now have less AI and there is more variety in the types, requiring you to tap wisely into the plasm pool to deploy the most adequate ghost for each situation.

However for GG Isuka the battles are 2-on-2 instead of 1-on-1, taking place in multi-plane arenas (similar to Fatal Fury) and requiring the players to switch orientation manually.<br><br>Added features include two new characters (only one playable), new backgrounds and game modes including the new "Boost" mode, which turns the game into a 2D side scrolling beat 'em up.

Description=Half-Life 2 is an FPS game where you once again play as Gordon Freeman, the MIT graduate from the  first game. You awaken a number of years after the original game on a train to City 17, an Eastern European city which is reminiscent of the World War II ghettos. And the people kept in City 17 are the remains of humanity, left at the will of the Combine, a mysterious alien group who retains totalitarian control of Earth.<br><br>You are soon brought into a resistance group, and make an attempt to bring down the Combine and liberate Earth. Why you? You saved it the last time. Or did you?<br><br>The player guides Gordon through the City 17 and the wilderness that surrounds it. On his way, he'll encounter a lot of friendly characters, but also fight dangerous foes and solve puzzles to progress. As Half-Life 2 features a realistic physics system, Gordon can pick up objects and toss them freely, and many of the puzzles are physics-based - for example, at one point the player has to weigh down a seesaw with bricks at one end to turn it into a ramp. <br><br>Gordon's enemies, apart from alien wildlife which found its way to Earth, are mainly Combine forces, which utilize a variety of firearms, gadgets and vehicles. Policemen and foot soldiers work along with helicopters, gunships and gigantic walking machines to hunt you down. To defend himself, Gordon has a range of weapons available: from the iconic crowbar for close-quarter fighting, through pistols and rifles, up to grenades and a rocket launcher. Most notable weapon is the "gravity gun", with which one can pick up objects, hold them in the gun's antigravity field, then hurl them at the enemy with great force. <br><br>Also with Half-Life 2 is Counter-Strike: Source, a version of Counter-Strike made with the new Source engine which powers Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, an online multiplayer game featuring the same physics and weapons as the single player game.

Description=In the sequel to Halo, Spartan-117, better known as the Master Chief, has returned to Earth, where he is promptly needed: despite all precautions taken, the Covenant have discovered the location of humanity's homeworld and are launching their attack. For some reason, however, their fleet is much smaller than expected. To solve this mystery, the Chief must return to the stars, learning more about the mysterious Halo rings and their constructors.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Covenant Elite who commanded the fleet at the Halo construct is blamed for the destruction of the ring and branded a heretic. The High Prophets grant him another chance, however: he is made the Arbiter, a special operative for the Prophets, ordered to carry out impossible missions. He will be dealing with dissent and rebellion among the Covenant - a conflict where he might find himself to be on the wrong side.<br><br>The player controls both the Chief and the Arbiter in Halo 2, a first-person-shooter in the same style as the first game. Its main gameplay characteristics are the same: only two weapons can be carried at a time (leading to a tactical choice as to which are to be taken), instead of a standard health points system there is the recharging energy shield (leading to an emphasis on finding cover during firefights), AI-controlled teammates will fight along the protagonist, and there are lots of sections involving vehicles.<br><br>New features include the ability to double-wield certain weapons, doubling the firing rate at the expense of accuracy and the ability to execute melee attacks or throw grenades. Part of the weapon arsenal is unchanged from the first game, but there are also some additions. The human projectile weapons are mostly new and include a pistol, shotgun, SMG and battle rifle. Returning are the sniper rifle and the rocket launcher. The Covenant energy-based weapons (still prone to overheating) from Halo all return, and new additions include several heavy hitters like the Brute Shot and Fuel Rod Gun along with the projectile-based Carbine and the Beam Rifle, both useful for sniping. The Energy Sword is a powerful melee weapon, able to kill most enemies with a single strike.<br><br>All vehicles from the original game also return: Warthog jeeps and Scorpion tanks for the Humans, Banshee fliers, Ghost gliders and Wraith tanks for the Covenant. A new addition is the Covenant Spectre, which with its rear-mounted cannon wielded by a dedicated gunner is comparable to the Warthog. A new player ability concerning vehicles is to board them while in use and either kick off the driver and take over, or in the case of heavy tanks, throwing in a grenade.<br><br>The multiplayer component of the game has been greatly expanded. On the Xbox, Xbox Live is now supported in addition to split screen and system link. The campaign can be played by two players in split screen. Competitive game types include Slayer and Team Slayer (standard free-for-all deathmatch), Capture the Flag, Assault (planting a bomb in the enemy base), Territories (controlling sections of a map for a certain amount of time), Oddball (finding a skull on the map and then holding on to it as long as possible) and more. All types have several built-in variants and can also be customized further. Players can choose from Spartan and Covenant Elite skins. The PC version comes with a map editor.

Description=Halo: Combat Evolved is a first-person shooter with considerable driving elements and the first game in the popular Halo series.<br><br>Humanity is the midst of a long war against an alien alliance called the Covenant who have been wiping out colony after colony. You hero is Master Chief, who is given no name beyond his rank in the game itself. He is stationed on the Pillar of Autumn, a ship which, per protocol make a jump in a random direction to retreat to avoid revealing the location of Earth. They find themselves at the titular Halo, a planet-sized ring of mysterious origin and function with the Covenant on their heels.  Master Chief must repel the Covenant assault and discover the secrets of Halo with the assistance of the female AI Cortana who lives in his suit and gives missions.<br><br>Features include friendly NPCs who fight alongside the Chief, squad-based AI where enemies groups work together to flank you under the direction of a leader unit and can be demoralized by his death. They also use cover, set ambushes, etc.<br><br>Only two weapons may be carried at a time: one active and one on back-up.  There are five human weapons and three Covenant with distinct art styles for the two groups. Human weapons look basically like real guns and fire projectiles. Covenant are sleek and purple and fire energy. For the most part, weapons are not just left around the environment and must be procured from fallen enemies though there are supply points.<br><br>Your life is armor and health as in most games of the genre, however, rather than armor being an item than is picked up, it is a force field which quickly recharges itself after several seconds without taking damage, which emphasizes finding cover.<br><br>One of most significant features is vehicles. You can drive a variety of vehicles in both single player and multiplayer, some of which have additional seats for passengers or gunners which can be used by AI characters. Vehicles also come in distinct human and Covenant varieties with their design philosophies.  Human vehicles roll around the ground on wheels and covenant vehicles hover or fly.<br><br>Halo also has a significant multiplayer component with basic deathmatch (called slayer here), capture the flag with the unusual addition that the flag takes your weapon spot while you are holding it, so shooting your way in and out of the base on your own is not an option, territories, and some options unique to the game, such as oddball, where you must hold onto a skull for the longest time, race where you score points by getting to checkpoints and juggernaut, where one super-powered player must get points by killing the others and the other players try to kill him to steal his powers. There is also a game editor which allows you to set custom rules for all the basic game types. All the playable weapons and vehicles from the campaign mode are available in the multiplayer maps with the ability for members of the same team to share the game's distinctive Warthog vehicle, which is essentially a small truck with a mounted gun on the back.

Description=Quidditch, the broomstick and ball sport of the Harry Potter world comes to life in this simulation.  For those unfamiliar with the game, two seven player teams of flying wizards attempt to score goals with one ball while dodging more flying balls and each other.  For those who are familiar with the game, you will be happy to know that the players, positions, and strategies of Quidditch are faithfully recreated.<br><br>The game starts with a player selecting which of the four Hogwarts school teams he or she wishes to play for.  Following some tutorial events, they are launched into the competition for the Hogwarts Cup against the other three teams.  As the player wins games and completes specific challenges (such as score 120 points in one game) they collect Quidditch cards which unlock special combo moves.  Once a player has won the school championship, they can go on to play as one of nine international teams competing for the Quidditch World Cup each with its own style and special combo moves.  After winning the cup once, there are still more cards to be collected by playing and winning as different teams.<br><br>People familiar with actual sports know that the rules of Quidditch (as described in Rowlings' books) are fundamentally flawed and that the only meaningful part of the game is the 1 on 1 competition between the two seekers trying to catch the golden snitch.  Quidditch World Cup alleviates this problem with the golden snitch bar.  As the game progresses, completing action combos and performing special moves adds to a team progress bar.  Eventually, when the snitch appears, the team with better positioning on the bar will start with an advantage in the chase.  Ironically, this system rewards things other than actual scoring so in-game goals still remain mostly meaningless (except on lower difficulty levels where it is very easy to build a 160+ point lead and make the snitch inconsequential).<br><br>Because it is designed for younger audiences, Quidditch World Cup lacks most of the advanced features you would expect in an EA sports game (league play, team management, etc).  It also lacks any multiplayer options other than two player (same machine) exhibition matches

Description=The perfect hitman, Agent 47, tries to distance himself from his violent past and becomes a humble church gardener. But he is tricked into returning to his trade when his friend, a priest, gets kidnapped by an Italian mafioso. <br>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a third-person stealth game. As a titular hitman, you have to complete a number of missions all over the world. Each mission generally involves assassinating someone, and possibly fulfilling a couple of other objectives. <br><br>Typically, your target will be protected by numerous guards. While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth. Agent 47 can sneak around to remain undetected, and he can disguise himself in clothes from killed or stunned guards. <br><br>The guards aren't completely stupid, however, as they will investigate suspicious noises, and they'll react if they see you waving around a gun. They'll get suspicious if they see you running around, raise alarm upon finding a corpse, and if you hang in a disguise around them too long, they'll eventually realize you're not one of their buddies. <br><br>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a "Mass Murderer", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the "Silent Assassin" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion.

Description=Jade Empire is set in an alternate medieval China, which incorporates not only classical elements of Chinese culture, but also supernatural beings and forces. You play the role of a young apprentice (male or female) of the old Master Li, a martial artist of the town Two Rivers. You are close to complete your training when a group of assassins burns down your town and abducts your master. Your journey begins when you decide to go all the way to Imperial Capital and to explore the Jade Empire in order to rescue the master and find the truth about your own destiny.<br><br>Jade Empire is a game that continues Bioware's RPG tradition. Compared to games like the Baldur's Gate saga or Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire has simpler gameplay. The combat is in real time. You have direct control only over your main character, although other characters join your party, fighting on your side. You gain experience points from battles, which you can use to increase your abilities and to specialize in one of the three combat styles: unarmed combat, combat with weapons (which require Focus points), as well as various techniques based on your Chi energy (magic). Like other classic Bioware RPGs, there are plenty of conversations with branching dialogue options. On many occasions you'll be forced to make a decision, choosing between two ideologies: "Way of the open palm" (the "good" one) and "way of the closed fist" (the "evil" one).

Description=The tenth installment in SNK's long running King of Fighters series, and the last KOF to appear on the Neo Geo system. This game's storyline focuses on the unexpected return of the Orochi power, who was thought to have been permenantly sealed away back in 1997 by Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chizuru Kagura. It appears that someone has been tampering with the seal, however...<br><br>This year there are 30 characters, 2 edit characters (Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami) and 2 hidden characters (Kusanagi from KOF '02 and Chizuru Kagura) to choose from. There are several returning characters (Jhun Hoon, King, Shingo Yabuki, Hinako Shijou, Billy Kane and Ryuji Yamazaki) and few new fighters as well (Ash Crimson, Shen Woo, Duo Lon, Malin, Adelheid Bernstein and Mukai).<br><br>Like The King of Fighters 2002, this game reverts back to the old 3-on-3 format used from KOF '94 to KOF '98. A new feature to this game that old-school KOF fans might have trouble getting used to is the new interchangeable team system. You still pick three characters and decide your character order before a match, but now you have the option to change to another character during a match. For example, if your character is low on power during a match, you can have either one of the other two characters at your disposal step in and take their place. It also works if you do not like the character that you have selected, or if you are having trouble using that character. You can change at any time during a match, but you cannot when two of your teammates have been taken out, and only one character is left in reserve.

While both heroes are different, they are similar in movement, ability to attack, defend, jump and access special abilities. Kain and Raziel no longer pick up weapons, instead both using a form of the Soul Reaver weapon (Kain uses the physical sword form, Raziel uses an energy blade). Each Soul Reaver can now be "charged" to unleash a special ability, determined by the current alignment of Soul Reaver at the time. Both Kain and Raziel lose energy at a constant rate and must feed to replenish life energy (Kain feeds on the blood of living creatures,  Raziel feeds on the souls of living and non-living creatures). And both Kain and Raziel feature telekinetic abilities to manipulate objects at a distance. <br><br>Kain and Raziel are different characters however, that play differently, each requiring use of his talents,to bypass obstacles (sometimes the same obstacle). Kain focuses on strong combat and destructive abilities. He is able able to power up the Soul Reaver weapon using properties of the Pillars of Nosgoth. Raziel is more subtle, able to use stealth and the phasing between material and spectral worlds in order to discover new paths. As in Soul Reaver, Raziel can phase into the spectral world at any time but must find a special location in order to phase back. Raziel powers up the Soul Reaver using elemental powers.

Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform "stealth kills" which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar.<br><br>The Serafan use Glyph magic, partially because it is deadly to vampires. Kain will often encounter areas where he is barred from progress because of Glyph barriers and must find a way around them. Additionally, glyphs function similar to electricity in that they power machines and switches. Many of the puzzles featured in Blood Omen 2 involve needing to create a glyph "circuit" in order to deliver power to a specific point. Glyph energy glows as it travels down it's connection, allowing the player to see exactly where the energy spark is.

Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces.

On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones).<br><br>The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really like you.<br><br>To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep.<br><br>But the real heart of Mashed is the split-screen multiplayer mode which you can play with up to four players on one PC. If you don't find four friends you can fill in the missing spots with bots or just leave them open. The additional eighth, multiplayer exclusive game mode is like CTF with cars. The goal is to hold the flag and drive as far away from the enemies as possible to get a point. To keep the race interesting for the players that are already out of it, they can use a helicopter which flies over the track to launch missile attacks on the cars still racing. So you can take your revenge before the race is even over and the racers have one more thing to worry about. But this feature can be deactivated when you setup the race.

Description=Based on the TV show, this game takes various shows and lets you make the vehicle that was made on the shows.  For those who do not know the TV show, it works like this...<br><br>Jesse and his team are to build a creation that will do a certain task within 7 days and by spending under $3000 and the vehicle must look stock when completed.<br><br>So this game gives you the task of building a vehicle that does something such as drive through a swamp by floating on the water and using a large fan to make you move.<br><br>In day one, you must design the vehicle.  In the early scenarios, you only have one pre-made design to choose from.  In later scenarios, you can choose from three pre-made designs.<br><br>Days two through six are devoted to constructing the vehicle.  You can buy various parts for the vehicle, but most parts will need to be fabricated.  To do this, you will need to purchase raw materials such as sheets of metal or metal rods and assign the task of making something like a roll cage to one of the team members.  They will make the item within a certain period of time while you handle other things. <br><br>Things you need to do include removing parts from the vehicle or attaching parts to the vehicle as needed, and welding items to the vehicle or cutting items off the vehicle.  Every weld and cut is already set up for you and you just follow the line indicated.  Bolts are unscrewed or screwed on as needed.<br><br>By day seven, your vehicle will have to have been completed, or you will need to try again.  Day seven is used only to update the look of your vehicle.  This includes adding certain custom parts such as gold plated rims, painting the vehicle, and applying decals.<br><br>Once you are ready, you will take your vehicle to test it out and see if it works.  If you made it to day seven without being required to start over, your vehicle will work.  This is really just a test where you must complete a track in a certain amount of time.  For example, in one mission, you will have to make it around a snow-covered track in your upgraded car that has snowmobile tracks added to help with tracking within a certain amount of time.  You get as many tries as you need to complete this.  Once done, you can move on to the next mission.<br><br>The challenges of this game are to stay under the $3000 when buying/selling parts and to complete the track at the end.

The enhanced Konquest mode (story/adventure mode) improves over the preceding versions, but has a shorter length. There are now 64 arenas (including revamped versions of classic environments) which each have their own tweaks, such as the ridiculous amount of stage fatalities (fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent, including classic techniques such as the "spine-rip" or "arm-break"). <br><br>In the new Kreate-a-character mode, you can design your own character and clothe them with familiar or new costumes. As described earlier, fatalities are a fancy way of killing your opponent and are pretty fun to watch. Various button presses and combos at the end of a fight will sometimes trigger fatality mode and if the right buttons are pressed the fatality can become a chain of fatalities. The Kreate-a-fatality allows you to redesign these finishers.<br><br>Perhaps the most amusing addition for longtime fans is the debut of "Motor Kombat," a racing mini-game patterned after Nintendo's Mario Kart. Motor Kombat has players selecting a vehicle from the following ten characters: Sub-Zero, Bo' Rai Cho, Scorpion, Mileena, Kitana, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Baraka, and Raiden. Each super-deformed driver performs his or her trademark move on rivals, from Raiden's electricity to Scorpion's spear attack.

In a final battle, Raiden fights Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, the two founders of the Deadly Alliance.  When it seems that Raiden is about to finish off the two enemies, they rebound and he is defeated.  With a zest for power and suspicion arising, Shang Tsung and Quan Chi then turn on each other, wanting Earthrealm for themselves.  When it appears that Quan Chi is victorious, the true ruler of Outworld returns, The Dragon King.  Quan Chi attacks The Dragon King, but is not powerful enough.  Shang Tsung, recovering from the battle, joins in, but they still cannot defeat The Dragon King.  Finally, putting thoughts of battle aside, Raiden awakens, and a new alliance forms between the three of them.  The combined powers of all three still cannot defeat The Dragon King.  Raiden sacrifices himself, Shang Tsung and Quan Chi to kill the Dragon King, but his sacrifice is in vain, and The Dragon King only becomes more powerful.<br><br>Deception has the standard Arcade mode, which takes you up a ladder of increasingly difficult enemies.  Introduced in last year's game, Konquest has returned, although it is much different.  Instead of following a set path, you are now free to roam multiple areas, like an RPG.  You may perform tasks for people in between learning new techniques.  Konquest mode is a third-person game, which can almost be called a game by itself.  There are two new game modes, Chess Kombat and Puzzle Kombat.<br><br>Chess Kombat is a standard game of chess, using fighters as pieces.  You move around like normal, and whenever two pieces meet, they jump into an arcade mode battle.  The winner of the fight takes the square.  Once the Leader (King) has been captured, game over.<br><br>Puzzle Kombat is a variation of Tetris and Dr. Mario.  You must rotate falling blocks, and place them in patterns.  You then get a special block which, when placed on top of the same color block, will destroy all the pieces, causing your opponent's board to fill up faster.<br><br>There are over twelve characters to choose from, including series favorites like Sub Zero and Scorpion.  There are characters from returing games, such as Mileena and Baraka, as well as hidden and unlockable characters, like Ermac, Noob Saibot and Smoke.<br><br>The Krypt is back, and again it allows you to open crypts, which contain goodies and unlockables, using koins earned by playing Arcade, Chess and Konquest mode.<br><br>There are a variety of different arenas to fight in, and some of them are interactive.

Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds.<br><br>As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their "badge rating" (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small "struggle" minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station.<br><br>Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points.<br><br>Players have a maximum badge rating of 100.  If it drops below 49, they are demoted to Patrolman and cannot take new story missions. The player must roam the streets in their police blues and stop enough random crimes to be moved back to Narcotics. If the player's rating drops below 24, they are kicked off the force and rendered jobless.  Jobless players cannot fight or shoot  weapons without attracting police attention. Further drops in rating cause the player to be wanted by the police, with a rating of 5 or lower spawning officers specifically to shoot or arrest the player.<br><br>There are 25 hidden drug stashes in each city. Finding all of them will unlock the original N.A.R.C. arcade game for play.

Description=The 2006 game in the Need for Speed series is an evolution of the gameplay introduced in the previous games. The career mode offers complete freedom in a city with a story mode supported by FMV cutscenes, as featured in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but now also set in the Carbon Canyon, where racers duel for territory in the city below. There still are many police pursuits. At the same time, the focus on tuning and sculpting your car remains, as introduced in Need for Speed Underground. As you win money from races, you can visit garages and car lots to make improvements to your vehicle.<br><br>Enhancements are still unlocked gradually, but the cars have now been divided over different tiers. There are about 40 cars to unlock. Many of them have been featured in previous installments, but there is a new selection and this year's edition introduces powerful muscle cars such as the Ford Mustang and Dodge Charger. Other features include the possibility to form your own crew, more detailed sculpting features, drifting races (introduced in NFS:U and replaced by drag races in NFS:MW) and the new car classes. The PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions offer online multiplayer, missing from the PS2, GC and Xbox releases. Up to eight players can race together, in the Pursuit Tag or Pursuit Knockout modes, with a few variations. Pursuit Tag is a race of one civilian car against cop cars. To become the civilian car, you have to tag it and then try to fend off the cops as long as possible until you are tagged again by other players. In Pursuit Knockout everyone starts as a civilian car, but the last one at the end of the first lap becomes a cop and needs to cause as much damage as possible to the other speeders. Another mode allows you to drive cooperatively (up to four players) in a single race.<br><br>The city and the surroundings in the career mode have been divided into different territories, controlled by gangs. You are either invited or challenged to race in the sections and claim them as your own. To do so, you have to impress the gang leader by winning races until he challenges you for a duel - first in the city, then over the narrow roads of Carbon Canyon. Scores are based on proximity. You need to follow the boss in the first race, and he is in pursuit in the second one. There are 4 boss duels in total.<br><br>The crew feature, with room for up to 6 cars, allows you to assign three roles to racers: drafters, scouts and blockers. These are supporting characters you can hire to help you win races. Drafters leave behind a coloured trail that makes it easier to find the way, scouts discover hidden shortcuts, and blockers try to cause mayhem to slow your opponents down. If you hire a scout, you get access to the new AutoSculpt feature. It enables you to modify the height of every part of your car through sliders, solely for visual effect. You can also buy full body kits.

This parametric camera is closer down than a typical top-down camera and includes automatic zooming and turning based on the players' position on the ice. Other improvements are the option to shadow opponents to put pressure on them and increase their chance of making a mistake. This is done by holding the left bumper and steering the right control stick towards another player. The amount of pressure can then be determined through taps, with hard tapping inevitably leading to a powerful check.<br><br>Aside from that, the game modes from the previous version are identical, as is most of the gameplay and the mini-games included.

The player character has a stamina which means that it's not very good idea to be standing in a freezing cold water for too long because if the stamina meter runs out, the health meter starts to deplete. Because of it, it's a good idea to warm up by campfires or eat something once in a while, thus restoring stamina.<br>Of course there is some weapons also, which one can use to dispatch enemies that wander too close. They range from a piano string to machine pistols.

Description=The story of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time starts with the Prince and his father, the King of Persia, besieging the Maharajah's castle to plunder the treasures hidden inside. In order to impress his father, the Prince sneaks inside to recover the magical Dagger of Time. He quickly learns that this dagger has the ability to control time. The malevolent Vizier has other plans for the dagger, however, and tricks the Prince into unlocking a mysterious secret of the Dagger that causes the King and many of his subjects to be turned into sand zombies. Now, the Prince must figure out what has happened and try to set things right again.<br><br>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an action adventure game that updates many of the gameplay concepts from the original two games and brings them into a fully 3-dimensional world.

The Prince also carries the Dagger of Time, which allows him to unleash several magical powers.  The most important of these powers is the ability to reverse time. This ability allows the player to reverse their actions when they lead the Prince to his death.

Description=ProStroke Golf: World Tour 2007 is a golf simulation which unique feature is the innovative control scheme. In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement. <br><br>This only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters.<br><br>Less innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself.<br><br>The game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators. With the editor the player can build own courses and tournaments.

Description=Psyvariar 2 is another specimen of the recent breed of "newschool" arcade shoot'em'ups (other examples being Ikaruga and Border Down). As many other recently released shoot'em'ups, it combines basic arcade shooter gameplay with modern 3D graphics to liven up the genre. The level backgrounds as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling two-dimensional plane which moves through the level.<br><br>As most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called "buzzing" and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship's rate of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again. <br><br>As in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot'em'ups, there are usually an  extremely high number of enemy shots on the screen. All these factors combine to make learning precise control a central part of the game.

Surviving as a bounty hunter in the rough-and-tumble Old West, Red stays ever watchful for some clue that could lead him to the men who murdered his father and mother -- and then one day, that clue appears. Step into Red's spurred boots, and take up his mission of revenge.<br><br>Red Dead Revolver features environments and artistry inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns films, mixed with third-person shooter gameplay similar to that of Max Payne.  The gameplay and story proceed linearly through stages, including several levels in which you play as different characters (a British trick shooter, a female rancher, a renegade Mexican general, a stealthy native warrior, and a Buffalo Soldier).  Each character has his own signature move: for instance, Red's "Dead-Eye" slows down time and allows you to set up targets for a rapid "fan fire" takedown, while General Diego's flare rifle lets you specify a target for bombardment by Diego's cannons.<br><br>Beating each level will earn you reward money (and chaining together many limb shots and multiple kills will earn you bonus money).

There is also a multiplayer game (split-screen only, not networked), which you can play with friends and/or AI bots.  Multiplayer incorporates a wide array of powerups, an alternative dueling showdown mode, and two kinds of optional poker sub-games (based on stud or Texas Hold 'Em) that mix some strategy into the action.

Ninjas sent by Nobunaga Oda attack his workshop, kill him, and leave Kurenai hanging from a tree tied by tetsugen, a piece of wire used by ninjas as a weapon. But a kind woman saves Kurenai, and trains her to be a ninja herself. This is where her quest for revenge begins.<br><br>"Red Ninja" is an action game with stealth elements. The primary weapon Kurenai uses is the deadly tetsugen. During the game you'll learn to perform new moves with this weapon. You can also use other weapons, such as a blowgun and throwing knives.

An effective way to kill enemies is to use stealth. Kurenai can approach enemies silently and hide behind objects. She can also "seduce" enemies, by talking to them in a sexy way and luring them to their death - a move that doesn't always work.

There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done.

Description=A complete remake of the classic 1986 title Defender of the Crown (not to be confused with the "Remastered" Windows version released in 2002), in Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown the player plays as the legendary folk outlaw in his quest to reclaim the throne of England after Richard Lionheart was captured in the crusades and his brother, John Lackland, usurped the throne and left him for dead in the Holy Land, attracting the ire of several knights. In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start.<br><br>Several gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John's stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard's ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.<br><br>As with the original game, action occurs in a turn-based map of England where the player decides which actions to take: conquer a neighbouring shire with Little John's army and hire soldiers either for him or territory defense, raid a castle or caravan, build strongholds, hold tournaments or spy on the other lords using Maid Marian's contacts on the court. Each of the attacking actions bring a quick minigame to be played:<br><br>The first mini-game that appears is the archery raid; in this mode, the player sees the action directly from Robin Hood's eyes while he lurks on a tree, the goal being to use Robin's trustworthy  bow and arrow to hit cavalry guards and the convoy as they pass by his spot. As some guards are also armed with a bow, Robin can also hide behind the log for cover.<br>If the player attacks a guarded territory, the game enters a strategic mode where the battle takes place on a three-lane field, and the goal is to vanquish the enemy defenses of force him to flee  by launching direct attacks on each lane.<br>Sword fighting pits the player against one or more opponents, depending on the setting. The goal is simple: slash everyone by throwing blows and dodge/parry the opponents' own. During raids there is also a timer that represents the time before sunrise - failing to escape before that or being killed results on Robin's imprisonment.<br>Battles are done on a real-time fashion, where both armies are placed on the far-sides of a multi-lane battlefield. The player chooses which lane to attack (or defend) and if successful, the opponent will lose enough units to flee or simply wait for their deaths.<br>Jousting in a tournament allows the player to fight for fame, and then for gold and land. To do so, after picking an opponent, he starts by building enough speed, and then slam the spear into the opponent, the goal being to knock him from his horse.<br>Some shires are protected by castles, and to conquer them, first a siege must be laid in. This requires the player to load up on catapults and then destroy each wall of the fortification by throwing boulders at it. Each wall represents a part of the defending army: the most damage done, the easier it becomes to invade it.

The 2003 game features a new plot not featured in any of the films. Crime is up in Neo-Detroit due to the rapid proliferation of a new designer drug "Brain Drain," and the efforts of crime lord William Nexx to control its profitable distribution. Meanwhile, a mayoral race is heating up and getting dirty. And of course, mega-corporation OCP's role in all this is almost certain, but unclear. <br><br>Robocop will have to get to the bottom of all of these mysteries through 9 missions. Gameplay is handled as a typical first-person-shooter, with various Robocop enhancements. His HUD is projected on screen and points out available targets. The player can mark up to three targets with a lock-on button, who Robo will then auto-aim at in sequence. Thermal vision can be activated to see through walls in a limited distance. Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons.<br><br>Objectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy's pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested. Should the player kill a hostage or surrendered enemy, they will take damage, forcing the player to follow Robocop's ethics and "prime directives."

Description=Ever had the urge to open an amusement park and create some wicked rollercoasters? Here is your chance! Rollercoaster Tycoon is an real-time isometric amusement park simulation. Create rollercoasters from over 50 designs, from classic wooden coasters to modern steel coasters in/around/through your park, as well as plenty of other attractions like miniature railways, boat hires, maze, slides, and more. Don't swing the guests too hard or they will become nauseus, but if you don't swing them enough it's not exciting. You need to tread the fine balance in your coaster design. For those who can't handle coasters, a set of less-intense rides like swinging ship or scrambled eggs may suit their needs. Or for the the truly timid, try slides and ferris wheel. Serve the customers' needs with restrooms, food (many different types from pizza to burger, fries to ice cream) and drink stalls, info kiosks, even balloon stands. Design the paths so customers don't get lost. Hire the staff to keep things running (engineers), clean (custodians) and safe (security guards). Beautify the place with flowers and plants, fountains and bench seats, lamps and signs, and more. Design how long you want to wait queue to be for a ride. Track EACH guest's feeling throughout the park and take surveys to find areas of improvement. Set prices for admission and/or for each and every ride. Remember, a happy customer spends more money! Can you build your park without going into bankruptcy? Comes with many scenarios. Winning each gains you access to tougher scenarios. Some have very little land, others have existing structures you must renovate. All are challenging.

Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked.<br><br>Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors.  The main differences are things like the inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies.  In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically either soldiers or archers.

In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending.

The game now puts the player in the shoes of Tony a few moments before the gang hits his office.<br><br>After he successfully defends his mansion, his empire lies in ruins. But Tony wouldn't be Tony Montana if he would just give up, so it is the player's goal to reclaim Miami once again. To do so, he has to earn money and respect. The only way to earn money in Miami is to deal drugs.  At the beginning the stuff is bought in small amounts and personally sold to the dealers. Eventually, however, Tony can set up so-called "Fronts" which are legitimate shops (like a car seller) in which drugs are sold in very large amounts. By overtaking "Fronts", Tony also increases his control over the current district of Miami. To completely overtake one part of town, all the enemy gangs scattered around in small groups must be eliminated.<br><br>After a deal, Tony has to launder the money at the local bank and have it transferred to his account. He then can buy "exotics" for his mansion like an expensive vase or a new car with a driver.<br><br>When talking with a dealer or trying to get cop heat down, the player has to play a mini-game that determines if Tony is successful and if so, how much he gets for the drugs or how much heat he loses.<br><br>Respect is earned by increasing Tony's territory, buying exotics and earning "balls" in fights and while driving. The enemies have different target zones which give a different amount of balls on a hit. This also fills up Tony's 'ball-meter". Once this is full he can enter a kind of god mode in which he is invulnerable and has unlimited ammo. Tony also gets health when killing someone in this mode. If he is driving a car he gets balls when making stunts like driving on the wrong side of the road or dodging an incoming car.<br><br>As in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the player is free to roam the city of Miami and there are also some side-missions with racing events.

These clones  and trained for battle and to fight for the Galactic Republic, trained in specific talents and abilities. One such specialization is Delta Squad, a group of four commandos trained for ground combat, recon work and outfitted with bacta healing implants. Delta squad is composed of four members: RC-1138 ("Boss"): the squadron leader bred for tactics, RC-1140 ("Fixer"): a computer cracker, RC-1207 ("Sev"): a hunter and marksman, and RC-1262 ("Scorch"): a demolitions specialist. Delta Squad and the rest of the clone army are deployed to their first battle, on the planet Geonosis.<br><br>Star Wars: Republic Commando is a first-person squad-based shooter set in the Star Wars universe with tactical squad gameplay. Players take the roll of Boss, the leader of Delta Squad. Like most first-person shooters, the emphasis in gameplay is on action. Republic soldiers use a standard gun weapon, the "Blaster", in order to shoot opponents in front of them. Blasters can be attached to perform three different functions, with individual ammunition: a standard fiting mode, a sniper mode and an anti-armor mode. Players also carry an smaller energy pistol that automatically charges itself. New weapons can be found from a defeated enemy or found lying around on some levels, however only one may be carried at any given time. Some player weapons allow zooming functions for more accurate firing. The player also carries 4 different types of grenades, which are: thermal detonators (basic blast), sonar detectors (limited proximity detection), electrostatic charges  (disables electronics and droids) and flash detonators (blinds foes). All of which can be thrown directly in front of the player. <br><br>Each member of delta squad has a personal shield that automatically recharges after a short time and a health bar which can only be replenished by healing bacta. Bacta is found at appropriate dispensers throughout the levels, and additionally each member of the squad carries an emergency bacta device to "revive" any member of the squad who falls in battle. Should the player be the one to lose all health, they watch the level from a hazed view and can issue a last order for other squadmates to try and revive them. Should all 4 members of delta squad fall in battle, the game is over.<br><br>The main feature of Republic Commando is the 4-man squad. Using a "one-touch" control system, the player gives orders to members of Delta Squad. The first type of command is for setting the squad's attitude: Search and Destroy (move forward), Form Up (stay close), Hold Position, and Recall from any assigned positions. The other type of orders are done by highlighting different positions displayed on the player's HUD and assigning a Delta member to perform the appropriate action. All of these positions are pre-defined in the level, with only a single action being possible. Examples of positions include: Cover for a sniper, barriers which need to be destroyed, turrets that can be mounted and used to attack the enemy, mines which can be disarmed, control panels which can be hacked, etc. Despite the hint of specialization designations and character personalities, any squad member, including the player, can be used to perform any action.<br><br>Multiplayer functionality includes regular deathmatches and capture the flag. There is no squad-based commands in multiplayer, though players may be placed on individual "teams" to work towards their goal.

They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon.  Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy!<br><br>The Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat.  Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles.  You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon.  Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.

Description=Tak, hero from the previous game has been randomly falling into deep sleeps.  During this time, he travels to a "Dream World", where he is told that he must rescue a princess, or else he will fall into a sleep from which he will never awaken from.  Tak and Jibolba, Tak's mentor, travel to visit Jibolba's brother, JB, who is an expert in dreams.<br><br>Tak 2 is fairly different from Tak and the Power of Juju.  While it is still a 3D platform game, it is more focused on puzzles and combat as opposed to collecting items.  In earlier stages, Tak must use animals to his advantage as he makes his way through levels - for example, a bear can be used as a trampoline, Tak can ride warthogs after being sprayed by skunks to mask his scent, and more.  Jibolba is along for the ride, but has transformed into a flea for easy transport.  As a result, you can throw him at enemies to bite them and make them sleepy.<br><br>Later on, Tak gains the power to transform into various animals himself.  As a frog he can swim without being eaten by crocodiles, he can soar on air currents as a flying squirrel, and can break through barriers by charging through as a warthog.  When Tak gains the titular Staff of Dreams as he progresses through the game, he can also create more powerful attacks using his magic, or "juju".

There is also an enhanced career mode where you can master your skills in a new Practice Facility. The golfers have a new animation state engine that yields more pertinent emotions and reactions based on what happens in gameplay. The game setup has been changed, with different swing styles, and the Speed Golf setting which allows players to skip to the next shot after the ball has been struck without watching where the ball lands.<br><br>PS2 and Xbox versions of the game feature a new team tour mode where you can recruit your own squad of golfers to go up against Team Tiger Woods.

As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all.<br><br>In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score.<br><br>The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a &quot;tunnel&quot; like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location.<br><br>Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales.<br><br>The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.

Description=Torino 2006 is the official game of the XX Winter Olympic Games held in Turin, Italy, and the eight in the line of multi-event IOC licensed titles. The game includes 15 events scattered on 8 disciplines: Alpine Skiing (Downhill, Super G, Giant Slalom and Slalom), Ski Jump (Normal and Large hill), Speed Skating (500m, 1000m and 1500m), Women's Biathlon, Nordic Combined, Bobsled (Womens' 2 and Mens' 4), Luge and Cross Country. All venues were modelled after their real counterparts.<br><br>Gameplay, as expected, requires more reflexes than the button-bashing of their Summer counterparts. Alpine Skiing is a matter of skill and quick reflexes, as the player, other than set the direction, only has to choose when to crouch to gain speed (mostly in Downhill and Giant Slalom) and when to carve the snow for sharper turns (either to correct a bad trajectory or approach a tighter gate). These events are based on a simplified version of the engine that power Ski Alpin 2006, also by 49Games. Unlike most other games that feature alpine skiing, the penalty for missing gate depends on the difficulty level chosen: on easy, six misses are allowed, three in medium and none on hard, each carrying a time penalty that depending on how well the player did can just affect the total score or mean losing a medal.<br><br>Ski Jump (also a simplified version of another game, RTL Skispringen 2006) requires the player to keep the balance while descending the hill, jumping at the correct time, counter the effect of the wind in the athletes' balance for maximum distance and then land in perfect telemark fashion.<br><br>Cross Country and Biathlon are relaxed disciplines where all that counts is keeping the best trajectory possible while looking out for straight paths that can be used for short sprints and downhill slopes that can be done while crouching, which allows greater speeds and lower fatigue accumulated from sprints and more hasty climbs. Biathlon is pretty much the same as Cross Country, except it also includes two shooting sessions, with the steadiness of the aim affected by the fatigue levels.<br><br>Skating disciplines require a strong, well timed start, and then accurate button pressing as the skater makes each step. <br>Bobsled and Luge are similar with only two differences: The startup in Bobsled is done by following the on-screen cues and press up on the right time and other than setting the direction, it's also possible to make minimal path changes. The winner is the fastest competitor after two heats (instead of the official four).<br><br>Nordic Combined is a Large hill ski jump which sets the start time for each competitor in the Cross country section.<br><br>It's possible to compete in all 15 or just 9 events, or even create your own competition, with up to four competitors. At each competition the players aim for both medals and the score table, based on the results on each individual event. However, the challenge does not stop with winning medals. The player can unlock additional strips by completing challenges, such as hitting all 10 targets in Biathlon, having a perfect Bobsled start, winning a gold medal and beat each top record on every event or not missing a single step on Speed Skating. The difficulty level affects events differently: in Alpine skiing,  it means CPU-controlled players are faster and fewer gate misses are allowed, in Ski jump wind can appear from any direction and in Speed skating, in addition to set the pace, the player also has to steer the athlete to keep her in the best path.

Rather than have the cars race laps, matches more often take place in open arenas of sand, ice, grass, mud and tarmac.<br><br>Multiplayer comes with different game modes. Traditional Last Man Standing is supplemented with multiple variations. A Hunter game-type, where one car is designated a target and points can only be scored by hitting it. There is also a score target which encourages going for the big points hits and stunts, rather than destroying competitors. Others are defensive and offensive driving challenges and a game type where only points scored by performing jumps and stunts are counted. Multiplayer is supported through 4-player split-screen, but no through Xbox Live play or the system link.

Description=After many years under Eidos/Silicon Dreams ownership and development, EA releases the official Champions League game for the 2004/2005 season. <br><br>The last rehash of the engine debuted on FIFA 2003, it draws most of it's gameplay elements from the 2005 edition, but with some changes to gameplay such as a slightly more aggressive AI on attack (reducing the need to constantly push players forward using the Off The Ball controls, still present), new refereeing aspects such as some deliberate errors (as in occasional bad offside calls or throw-ins, not cheating the player through mistakes),  advantage rule and handballs and a new set piece system, which replaces the much criticized "targeting" and "push and shove" featured in 2005. This system is much less rigid and less formulaic, as a directional arrow and powerbars define how balls are crossed and there are four player movement setups, thus making each corner and indirect free kicks different. For direct free kicks, players have the option to take driven or curved shots or drop a pass to a nearby player to explore a gap in the defense. All options are available at all times, instead of being determined by the distance to goal. <br>Many of these changes were later adapted into the new FIFA 06 engine, and it was also chosen as the match engine for subsequent Bright Future's  FIFA Manager. <br><br>The presentation takes notes from real television broadcasts, with goals, fouls and attempts on goal being recapped not only in the full-time highlight reel but also during game stoppages and PiP popups. As the game is presented in a faux letterboxed format, next to the scoreline some statistics occasionally popup, allowing to keep track of them for some missions. A very requested feature, the ability to see the energy bars of the closest players to the ball of both teams, was finally included, as well as icons for the special abilities (speed, shooting, dribbling or tackling) of the best players.<br><br>The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the "The Season" mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final.  This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if  failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, "home and away" (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice.

Description=Some years after the Strider Wars, humanity has resumed its expansion into space. On the rough frontier, it falls to the Terran Colonial Authority to maintain peace and order among the outlying colonies and outposts. TCA Marshal John Dalton and the crew of his ship, the Atlantis, patrol this dangerous sector of space when several distress calls lead to the discovery of alien artifacts with unique properties. Soon, the hunt for these artifacts is on between several alien factions as well as human corporations and their mercenary forces, with the TCA and their allies caught in the middle.<br><br>The first-person shooter Unreal II, while a sequel to Unreal, has no direct connection to the first game except being set in the same universe (with the Skaarj from Unreal and the Liandri Corporation from Unreal Tournament being major enemy factions). The player controls John Dalton through a dozen missions, taking place in such locations as the dense jungle of a tropical planet, a research facility on a frozen moon, the insides of a planet-sized living organism, the home world of an insectoid machine civilization, as well as a huge starship.<br><br>The weapon arsenal consists of more than a dozen guns. Standard types include pistols, an assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. Some heavier ones are a flame thrower, as well as rocket and grenade launchers, with the grenade launcher being able to use six different ammunition types, including fragmentation, EMP and smoke grenades. Available in later missions are weapons adapted from alien technologies. These include various energy guns, a biological weapon that creates living spiders that attack enemies, and an autonomous floating orb that either seeks out and attacks enemies or circles around the player in point defense. As in other Unreal titles, each weapon has two different firing modes.<br><br>Missions are usually of the run-and-gun type, but there are exceptions. Several levels include defense assignments where either a position must be held for a certain time or a character be kept alive. These levels usually include additional tools such as energy barriers and automated turrets that can be placed by the player in any location. Sometimes, AI-controlled characters will be there to help out the player as well. In that case they can be given orders on which sector to defend or patrol, for example.<br><br>The story of the game is told through a variety of means: besides in-engine cutscenes, there is a lot of radio chatter during a mission; in fact, it's not unusual for mission objectives to completely change due to story developments. Between missions, Dalton can wander freely about the Atlantis and chat with his crew, going into their personal backstories as well as more details about the main plot.

Description=Warpath is a budget-priced first-person shooter from the same people that developed Pariah. As such, the gameplay is very similar to that game. For instance, you can heal yourself with a portable healing tool, and run at speeds so fast that they blur your vision. The main difference between the two games is that the singleplayer game is multiplayer-oriented, similar to Unreal Tournament. There is a storyline, however. You can select from one of three races fighting for the control of a beautiful, resource-rich planet named Kaladi. The Ohm are a cyborg-like race that need the planet's resources to live. The House of Kovos are robots that want to take control of Kaladi because their religion says that they should. The Human Coalition is a group of homeless humans that are trying to find a home.<br><br>In the singleplayer game, each arena is connected by a turn-based, Risk-style minigame. There's a zone for each side of the war, each with five arenas, for a total of 15 arenas. When it's your turn, you can choose an arena to attack that's owned by either of the other two sides. When you attack, the other side will try to defend the arena. If you win, you take control of that arena. If you win an attack on certain arenas, you can unlock a new weapon in the game. If you have control of all 15 arenas, you get to play a surprise "boss" arena.<br><br>Warpath's weapons and healing tool are also upgradeable. In singleplayer, you get skill-based weapon upgrades between levels. In multiplayer, you upgrade weapons just like you did in Pariah -- pick up weapon energy cores from fallen enemies and upgrade your weapons during gameplay.

Starting months before the events of the film, The Warriors expand and defend their Coney Island turf, while proving that they are heavy enough players to join The Riffs network.  With a citywide rep, they can get invited to a major gang meeting where the future of New York street crime will be decided.  <br><br>The game follows the nine lead members of The Warriors (with flashback missions showing how they came to The Warriors): leader Cleon, Swan, Ajax, Cowboy, Cochise, Snow, Fox, Rembrandt, and Vermin.  During the game, the player will control each member, usually acting as a war chief and leading a squad of Warriors on a mission.  Missions vary from simply wrecking another crew to completing a series of objectives while avoiding arrest or worse. <br><br>During missions, players can mug pedestrians, steal car radios, commit smash and grabs, tag walls or bomb other gangs burners, and load up on flash.  Between each story based mission, The Warriors return to their Coney Island hangout where they can train to improve their stats, go out on patrol, review their accomplishments, replay levels, or enter into a series of quick-play combat matches.  <br><br>The game plays like a squad-based brawler.  Each Warrior has his own fighting style and much of the game environment can be weaponized.  Fights are fast and often brutal, but stealth is also an option.  Players can perform stealthy finishing moves and distract police or other gang members with thrown bottles.  The games environments are fully 3D allowing Warriors to escape along the rooftops, hop over fences, or dash into shadowy areas.

The side scroller turns into a maddening ride through high detail mechanic and organic 3D worlds, but on every junction you can choose where you want to go. 6 huge levels stretch your perseverance to the limits, while you blast away waves of enemies with your blaster beams, outsmart patterns of baddies with your special attack pickups, or rocket-target mid-bosses and end-bosses until they finally break down and explode in fantastic dynamic particle effects.  The enemy models are all high-detail with lods, while the designs are based on Aliens, Buck Rogers and Battle Star Galactica.  The game steadily maintains a solid 60fps constantly, even when the screen is full of mad action and special effects, splattering across the screen. To fight the baddies you have a laser beam at your disposal and a rocket pack, along with "specials" (pick-ups) that you can harvest during play. Your weapons are upgradeable, which makes this game also a tactical exercise:  mechanic weapons have more effect on the bigger enemies, while organic weapons have more effect on the little ones.  Of course, everything revolves around scores, as this title is Live aware and offers Xbox Live boards bragging rights.<br><br>The game is wrapped into a story and basically tells the tale of the space-witch Aguira, a young fragile girl, who has turned the world of Mardar into living hell.  Her sentence is death by the Maelstrom, a gigantic black hole.  But on route to the Maelstrom, the ship that takes her there is hit by a meteorite full of Xyanide, which allows her to materialize her thoughts and escape.  Her first target, surprisingly, is you, as you are Drake, her executioner who accompanies her into the Maelstrom. Your ship becomes entangled into her world, and you have to fight her demons and destroy the crystals that power her devilish creations. Between each level you get a new animated cut-scene that completes the story. The surround-sound music score and special effects are background, and serve their purpose, but you can also play your own music.

Description=Zuma Deluxe  is an Aztec-themed action puzzler. The goal: eliminate all the balls before they reach the skull. Balls roll down a track towards this skull and the player-controlled frog-shaped idol must shoot balls toward them to stop them, earning points. Using the mouse to rotate the frog and clicking to fire, the player needs to create rows of three or more of the same color balls to eliminate them.<br><br>The catch is that each track is shaped differently. Part of the track may block others so that if the track is filled with balls, the ones behind some may be unreachable. Fortunately, the player has up to four lives, a rarity in many puzzle games.<br><br>The game offers two different play modes:<br><br>1. Adventure Mode<br>The player must battle through multiple temples to find the secrets of the Zuma. In this "campaign mode", temples that have been defeated may be skipped by the player when the player continues the game via save game.<br><br>Gauntlet Mode<br>The player must work the player's level up from Rabbit to Sun God. Levels used in this mode must first be unlocked from the Adventure Mode. Gauntlet Mode also offers 4 (four) additional play modes: Random, Spesific, Practice, and Survival.
