ace>Space Ace>1984>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Cinematronics>Advanced Microcomputer Systems>Adventure>3.5>1-2 Players>The object of the game is not only to rescue Kimberly, but also help Dexter regain his manhood by becoming Ace again, destroying the Infanto Ray, defeating Borf and saving the Earth. As you journey through outer space on this perilous quest, you will encounter all kinds of dangers with enemy spaceships, alien creatures and other nemesis.You make all the decisions on the game as you direct either Dexter or Ace with the joystick depending where you are at. The button does not only make Dexter or Ace fire his blaster, but it can also transform Dexter into Ace at certain parts of the game whenever the word "Energize" appears on the screen, but that is only if you choose to do so.If you make it to the end of the game, Dexter will be Ace again for good, he and Kimberly will be reunited, Borf will be turned into a baby by his own weapon (now destroyed) and the Earth will be safe. Afterwards, the game ends. Contrary to popular belief, both Dragon's Lair and Space Ace did contain diagonal movements. In some cases, these movements were simply the combination of two acceptable moves, while in other cases the diagonal move was distinct (for example, during the whirlpool segment in Dragon's Lair moving right or left is acceptable, moving diagonal up-right or up-left is acceptable, but simply moving up results in death). In all cases, the diagonal moves were optional, and there was always a 4-way alternative. The '91 re-release of Space Ace contained some diagonal moves that were required.
astron>Astron Belt>1983>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Bally Midway>Sega>Shoot-'Em-Up>3.6>1 Player>Astron Belt is an early laserdisc video game and third-person space combat rail shooter, released in 1983 by Sega in Japan and licensed to Bally Midway for release in the United States. Developed in 1982, it is commonly cited as the first laserdisc game. Astron Belt is basically an enhanced version of the simple space-shooters that were popular at the time. The player controls a lone spacecraft on a mission to singlehandedly take down the entire enemy armada. Enemy fighters and ships shoot at the player, and there are mines and other objects that must be shot or avoided. The game is divided into waves. At the end of each wave is a command ship that must be destroyed. In later waves the enemy fighters move and shoot more aggressively, and their shots are more accurate. Some waves take place in open space, while others require the player to battle enemies while flying through narrow trenches and tunnels. The player is on a timer at the beginning of the game, with an unlimited number of lives available. The length of the timer can be adjusted by the machine operator, but is normally 60 seconds. After the timer expires, the player is given a limited number of additional lives. When all of those lives are lost, the game ends.Astron Belt came in both upright and cockpit cabinets. The cockpit version featured illuminated buttons on the control panel, a larger 25" monitor (the upright used a standard 19"), and a vibrating seat.
badlands>Badlands>1984>ESRB - T (Teen)>Konami>Konami>Adventure>3.6>1-2 Players>Badlands continued the Super Sprint lineage, but moved the game into a futuristic post-apocalyptic setting. The races consist of 3 souped-up cars toughing it out over 4 laps on one of the 8 tracks, which are viewed from above. Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.

galaxy>Galaxy Ranger>1983>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Bally Midway>Sega>Shoot-'Em-Up>2.9>1 Player>The game is divided into different waves. At the end of a wave there is a command ship which must be destroyed. Some waves required the player to maneuver their fighter through a trench while trying to destroy enemy fighters. With each successive wave the enemy fighters became more aggressive and accurate with their shots.The first 60 seconds of game play are penalty free, meaning that your fighter can be repeatedly destroyed without the game ending. After 60 seconds, if the player is destroyed, the game is over unless an extra ship was earned. The enemy fighters are all laser disc generated along with the backgrounds, except for the mines. Enemy fighters shots are computer generated and come from the fighters as they move around the screen. Results in a greater interactivity of the laser disc video and makes game play less linear.
gpworld>GP World>1984>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Bally Midway>Sega>Driving>2.5>1-2 Players>GP World has a simple premise: the player must race against the clock and computer-controlled Formula 1 opponents in a series of races.

hayate>Ninja Hayate>1984>ESRB - T (Teen)>Taito>Taito>Adventure>3.5>1-2 Players>The game tells the story of a skilled and daring teenage ninja named Hayate, infiltrating an evil castle in an attempt to rescue a princess he loves.[3] Hayate must survive a collection of deathtraps and defeat a variety of mythological creatures and other adversaries on his quest to save the princess and destroy the castle. The game draws players to guide Hayate with a joystick for moving him around and one button for using weapons through 15 different stages that take place in feudal Japan-based areas. There are three difficulty levels. Like earlier laserdisc games such as Don Bluth's Dragon's Lair, Ninja Hayate contains traps and creatures that requires players to dodge or attack them at specific moments, by watching for the warning buzzer (like Dragon's Lair) in addition to flashing objects (e.g. arrows, buttons, light, etc.). If a player makes a mistake, one life decreases, and when players run out of lives, the game ends.Unlike Don Bluth's laserdisc games, Ninja Hayate is animated with anime drawings by Toei Animation. Another difference is that the game flashes the buttons that need to be pressed directly on the screen. Sometimes it also flashes multiple possible button presses on screen, indicating different paths that the player can take.
interstellar>Interstellar>1983>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Funai>Funai>Shoot-'Em-Up>3.2>1 Player>You are Frald Rancer and control a space ship which must journey from your home planet to outer space to defeat enemy invaders. Once all the enemies are defeated then return home. The game moves in a forward direction where the screen objects move towards and down to the player. Approaching enemy ships are small, in the distance, and become larger and move faster as they approach the player. The player controls a fighter at the bottom of the screen, which can only move from side to side. Shots can be fired at a diagonal, as well as straight, by twisting the joystick from side to side. At certain stages, ground targets will appear and can be destroyed by using the "Burn" button. The laser disc generated backgrounds are largely non-interactive during game play. They form the backgrounds on which the game is played on. Scenes do work in with the backgrounds, however that is the extent. Some backgrounds appear as they should have elements of interactively, however, were not used in the release of the game. These include scenes where the player is going through an asteroid field and asteroids fly towards the player. Another scene is in the crystal caverns, where there are many obstacles which could have been made to be avoided. These are only two of many scenes which could have had interactive elements. The game may have been decided to have been too hard to play with these background obstacles and computer fighters to play. Hence removing the background interactively to make the game more playable. The game starts with the player in Frald Rancer's home city, then taking off into outer space via a fly-by of the city. The backgrounds are very Sci-Fi and are fantasy themed. They are very interesting, more so than the game. The music from the laser disc also complements the laser disc video very well and makes up for the sometimes annoying, computer generated sounds.

mach3>M.A.C.H. 3>1983>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Mylstar>Mylstar>Flying>4.0>1 Player>Gamers have the choice to face off against enemy planes and ground targets as a fighter, or to fly at high altitude over arial targets as a bomber. Using an elaborate flight stick, they can fire a machine gun at the targets as well as launch missiles as they infiltrate the enemy landscape. Targets to be destroyed are surrounded by a computer generated yellow box. The fighter sequences are generally low-flying affairs as the player must avoid the scenery while blowing up ground targets and shooting oncoming enemy planes and missiles. Taking the other choice, the bomber drops its payload on ground targets and destroys enemy fighters with its machine gun fire. Players are warned of approaching planes by a red warning signal at the top of the screen. Since the enemy country seems to have had some kind of nuclear mishap, the game later provides radioactive clouds for players to avoid. If they can survive till the end, the game takes 15 minutes to complete with a finale airport landing.
