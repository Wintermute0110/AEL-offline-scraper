A+M+O+K (USA)>A+M+O+K>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA Corporation>Lemon>Shooter>3.9>1-2 Players>Amok portrays a futuristic storyline on a planet which is identified in the manual as having the same name. There, two gigantic corporations, referred to by the acronyms NONLUN and AZTK, had previously been having an all-out war between them for forty-seven years. The war had involved all possible fronts and theaters, including operations in the air, on the surface of the land and sea, and beneath the water. Very recently, a weak peace accord had only just been reached. In the manual, the peace accord is described as being much like "a blanket covering the fire that smolders in the hearts of the people. The agreement is sufficiently unsteady that an influential mercenary company, known only as "the Bureau," has now decided to hire a capable battle walker pilot named Gert Staun to restart the war so they can continue to make large amounts of money by taking lucrative contracts from both sides. The player takes the role of Gert Staun.&#xA;Naturally "the Bureau" has placed a high priority on this, and they are funding it entirely on their own. Indeed, Gert Staun's battle walker, called the "Slambird" is explicitly said to be custom-modified. In particular, the Slambird can not only survive either on land or underwater, but it can transition between the two -- it can move, fight, and safely control its vertical position in either environment. These abilities are portrayed as costly and not standard to such vehicles in the universe where Amok takes place. The transformation of the Slambird between an underwater vehicle and a land vehicle is automatically scripted, however. The player has no power to control this transformation or alter the time when it happens. Instead, the player must get to the point when Staun will automatically bring the Slambird ashore to continue his attacks.&#xA;The object of this arcade-type game is to meet a series of objectives, and to do so in such a way that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.

You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.&#xA;Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.&#xA;Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.

Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.&#xA;Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).&#xA;Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead.&#xA;Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery.&#xA;Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.

Clockwork Knight (USA)>Clockwork Knight>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>AM7>Platform>3.6>1 Player>Clockwork Knight is a game that depicts the sometimes friendly, sometimes combative, secret lives of toys. Betsy has a huge number of toys that come to life in the absence of humans and normally play nicely with each other. In the opening introduction, the somewhat inept clockwork knight Pepperouchau is competing with some other knights for the affections of a princess who lives in the clock. Everyone is having a grand time until a rogue toy shows up through the air vent, absconds with the princess, and turns many of the other toys against Pepperouchau.&#xA;The gameplay consists of side scrolling action through various stages constructed of elaborate series of toys, traps, and common household items. The first stage is a quest through Betsy's room with lots of letter blocks, sharp crayons, and dollhouses precariously balanced on robots that tend to fall on you. Pepperouchau is armed with a key sword that has offensive use as well as the ability to open boxes that functions as warps to other areas. The second stage takes place in Betsy's brother's room. Kevin has a lot of engineering skill and has built an impressive network of cranes and trains that Pepperouchau will need to activate in order to clear the area. Watch out for the jet transformer boss at the end of the room.&#xA;Other stages include missions through other areas of the house including the kitchen and the attic. Throughout the game you also collect coins. 20 coins are worth a continue when you run out of lives. Further, you meet other friendly toys between levels who give you the opportunity to gamble with your earned coins.

It maintains the same game style (a mixture of 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D elements, moderately in the fashion of Sega Saturn's Bug!), colorful music and gameplay of its predecessor. However, your mission will be somewhat different this time (although still related with Clockwork Princess Chelsea), as the ending scene of the first game did not come as good as expected and because of that, you should try to give the best of yourself again in order to completely recover Chelsea for Pepperouchau.

You are used to orders of hunting down the Resistance, a ragtag band of rebels committing sabotage and other acts of terrorism against the WEC, but slowly, you realized the WEC is not quite what it appears to be... then one day you and two other Silencers, your best buddies, were ambushed by a WEC mech patrol when it was supposed to be a routine mission. You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... and the only place to turn is the Resistance...&#xA;Crusader: No Remorse is the first in the series, which is best described as a 2D isometric shooter. Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves. You get plenty of different weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to grenade launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma cannons. You're up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don't). You'll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there's usually a bit of puzzle involved. It's often a matter of exploring the map to find a switch or a terminal with the code that'll let you access another part or another level of the map.&#xA;Between missions you can chat in the Resistance base and/or buy/sell weapons. You can also find recharge stations to replenish your energy and health (you can also find batteries and first aid kits too). The missions range from simple sabotage to rescue.

If the screen becomes too crowded, clear it with a smartbomb.&#xA;At the end of some acts, you can choose from one of two paths through the next act, giving you different ways of completing a stage. At the end of each stage, a boss enemy awaits.

Daytona USA - Championship Circuit Edition (USA)>Daytona USA - Championship Circuit Edition>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>AM2>Driving>3.7>1-2 Players>All of its predecessor and then some. More tracks, many more cars (hidden cars as well), smarter AI, more music (no more lyrics for the in-game race music either), broader 2-player gameplay, more refined arcade physics...and on top of everything else- BETTER GRAPHICS! The first Daytona on the Saturn boasted some hefty visuals, great for displaying the Saturn's power to the masses at the console's birth; but for the Saturn to be revered for everything it was, Sega (and AM2) had to make something a little flashier. All the graphics in the game have been updated...both the cars and tracks have higher polygon count, better texture mapping; the framerate is QUITE noticeably improved, everything is very smooth.
Daytona USA (USA)>Daytona USA>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega AM2>Driving>3.9>1 Player>A port of the most successful arcade racer ever, the home versions of Daytona USA include the same elements that made the original version successful: three highly detailed tracks, arcade driving physics that challenge the player to find the best trajectory to make a flying lap without kissing the rails and beating the checkpoint timer. The 40 cars of the Easy race (later named 3-7 Speedway), one of the stalwarts of the original version, are also present in this version.&#xA;These home versions include a new mode (Saturn or PC Mode, depending on the platform) where the three tracks are played without the timer, and optionally in mirror mode, using one of the bonus cars (with additional abilities such as driving on grass or hitting the rails without losing speed) and in one of three lengths: Normal (identical to the arcade original), Grand Prix (2.5 times longer) and Endurance (10 times longer).&#xA;On the downside, detail and frame rate suffered a drop to fit the game into the limited hardware of the Saturn and Personal Computers, and lacking any kind of multiplayer, comparing to the two to eight player rumbles of the arcade version.
Dead or Alive (Japan)>Dead or Alive>1997>CERO - C (Ages 15+)>Tecmo, Ltd.>Tecmo>Fighter>3.9>1-2 Players>The first in the Dead or Alive series, and features many of the same features that has made the DoA series so popular today; somewhat realistic combat, good character design, and scantily clad women whose breasts bounce a lot.&#xA;The game doesn't mess too much with a background story- it's a 3D one on one fighter that takes place within an arena of limited space. Each character has their own unique way of fighting, their own abilities, and even their own hobbies and likes. (For example, Ryu Hayabusa- yes, he of Ninja Gaiden fame- likes sushi, mountain climbing, and fishing.)
Decathlete (USA)>Decathlete>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Corporation>Sega>Sports/Olympic>3.6>1-2 Players>Sega's own version of Decathlon, the most grueling of multi-event sports consisting of the 100-Meter Dash, Long Jump, Shot Put, High Jump, 400-Meter Race, 110-Meter Hurdles, Discus Throw, Pole Vault, Javelin Throw and the 1500-Meter Race, split over two days of competition. Featuring eight athletes with different abilities and specialties, from the agile Karl Vain and Femi Kadiena, the fast Li Huang and Ellen Reggiani, the well balanced Joe Kudou and Rick Blade to the powerhouses Aleksei Rigel and Jef Jansens, the player must achieve the best scores possible in each event to get to the World's best results table, not only in the decathlon points table but also on the individual events table.&#xA;All events follow the core gameplay of other athletics titles (such as Track & Field), with some changes from event to event. Spriting events such as the 100-meter dash are pure button-bashing, with the 110-Meter Hurdles requiring an additional tap in the action button to pass the athlete at the correct time over the hurdle without losing speed or knocking it down. At the opposite level, the 400-Meter and the 1500-Meter Race add a stamina bar that must be kept above critical levels at all times to keep the athlete fresh until the end, this being done by simply pacing the number of presses done by the player (the 1500M also requires the player to steer the athlete in the best path: as close as possible to the inside edge without hitting other runners or losing speed from going over the edge). Jumping events, along the javelin, require a fast build-up, an well-timed action (be it jump, set the pole or release the javelin), and setting the most appropriate angle. Discus is the only event where button mashing isn't required, and asks the player to rotate the D-pad clockwise to build strenght, followed by a push of the action button to set the angle of release as well as the direction.&#xA;Like in the original ST-V version (which means it is in every way similar to the arcade version), two players can compete at the same time in the running event, and at the 1500M race six drones compete at the same time.

The occupants of the underwater facility are ordered to board the submarine and find out what went wrong. On board the vessel, strange things are happening which are taking control of the crew. The crew are mutating due to an alien parasite and members of the search team have to figure out what is happening and how to stop it!&#xA; The game is played via a third person view which is just behind the character and you look over his shoulder. The game is based underwater in a submarine so the developers have added a claustrophobic feeling by giving some areas a limited amount of air so you have to run through to activate the air circulation system. Controls are your typical Resident Evil style which is you pull the Right shoulder button to draw your gun, your d-pad to aim and then a button to shoot. Along your journey of the submarine, you will need to find objects such as keycards to unlock doors and better weapons.

Defcon 5 (USA)>Defcon 5>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Data East USA, Inc.>Millenium Interactive>Shooter>3.3>1 Player>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.&#xA;The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.&#xA;A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success.&#xA;As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.

One or two players work their way up and down a skyscraper in attempting to rescue the President's kidnapped daughter.&#xA;A large number of fighting moves are available through the simple controls of punch, kick and jump, plus movement.&#xA;Many weapons are available from knives and broken bottles to machine guns and rocket launchers. Other objects can be picked up and used as weapons such as chairs, an aerosol and lighter combo and even a grandfather clock!&#xA;Between several of the stages are reaction tests that require a button to be pressed quickly, usually punch, kick or jump. Failure means an extra fight has to be won often with little or no reward in terms of items.&#xA;The climax sees the heroes fighting the mastermind (who has many swords on his person) on the roof of the skyscraper.&#xA;Also included is an old Sega arcade game, Deep Scan, used to gain extra credits for the main game.

Dragon Ball Z - The Legend (Europe)>Dragon Ball Z - The Legend>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Bandai S.A.>BEC>Fighter>2.4>1-2 Players>Dragon Ball Z - The Legend is a game that adds another Dragon Ball to the franchise of the same name and starts with the events of the Saiyan Saga and the fight with Vegeta and Nappa. In Idainaru Dragon Ball Densetsu you don't have your natural one on one fights. At the beginning of each fight you are given a total of 4 fighters (up to 6 later) from which you have to choose the 3 that you would like to participate in the battle that follows. Each fighter has 2 bars - a green and a yellow one. The green represents the life force and the yellow the power force which is depleted with every attack you do. At the bottom of the screen there is a blue bar and a red one that form a gauge called Power Balance. The reason for this gauge to be there is because your attacks don't affect the enemies' life bar directly. By continuously attacking the enemy the bar that represents your power (blue bar) increases while that of the enemy (red bar) decreases. When the blue bar covers all the gauge a random attack sequence, from the current character you're controlling, is initiated and that's how you can actually injure your opponents. The same can happen to you though if the enemy's red bar covers all the gauge.

It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.&#xA;There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.&#xA;The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system&#xA;FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup.

Fighters Megamix (USA)>Fighters Megamix>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega>Fighter>3.8>1-2 Players>Virtua Fighter 2 was full of many brand new gameplay elements implemented into the realistic fighting engine of the first Virtua Fighter. The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay.&#xA;In Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers. Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2. Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for "casual" gamers.&#xA;Mixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult. But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options. The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay. Other options are unlockable while playing the game.&#xA;One good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters. Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers but there are also 10 other hidden characters that can be unlocked by playing well in the Saturn version, including two from the arcade-only Sonic the Fighters. There are only 4 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and 4 from Fighting Vipers in the Game.Com version.&#xA;This game was one of the very last games to appear on the Sega Saturn in the United States and was directed by Yu Suzuki.

The Mayor decided to hold a fighting tournament with the grand finale being held on the top of the city tower, and the Vipers, young urban warriors decide to compete, each with their own goal on mind. All eight came from several backgrounds, like the hard-rocker Raxel, the orphan with a burning desire to meet his father Bahn, former gang leader Tokyo, queen of the catwalk Grace, the giant with an unknown past Sanman, construction worker and former marine trainee Jane, fashion designer to-be Candy and skater boy Picky, plus Mahler, someone with a score to settle with the Mayor.&#xA;While based on the same Model-2 arcade board as Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers included several changes, such as a wall surrounding the battle area and equipping each fighter with a two-piece (chest and legs) armour that can only be broken with power hits. Once the armour is gone, the unfortunate fighter is more vulnerable to opponent hits, and damage can also be collected after hitting the wall or floor after a throw.&#xA;Gameplay is also radically different from Virtua Fighter - noticeably faster, with combos done by fast button-mashing sequences sometimes on the same button, instead of the timed presses that require an additional push on the d-pad of the first title. Another new addition to gameplay is the Quick recovery, which allows a fighter that suffered a severe blow to quickly get on his feet, avoiding damage and allowing for a quick counter, but at the same time leaving him open for another blow if the opponent is fast enough. to react.&#xA;Game modes include Arcade, Vs, Team Battle (best of 9) and Training. Game options allow the player to tweak the difficulty setting, number of rounds before a match winner is decided, size of life bars, if there's a time limit, if the order of opponents is random or predefined and between three game modes: Original (based on the arcade version), Arrange (gameplay tweaked for the Sega Saturn) and Hyper (allows Vipers to voluntarily drop their armour, allowing to perform special attacks at lightening fast speeds), Stage selection, and to change the disposition of the control pad to better suit the players' style.&#xA;Another mode, Playback, allows to see rounds previously saved by the player or fighting demos recorded by the AM#2 staff, each with the ability to choose a camera. As usual with Sega's fighting ports, extensive bookkeeping is included, as well as a few hidden characters.

For some reason Death Adder decided to set up a Street Fighter-like tournament to give his enemies an opportunity to slay him and prevent the end of the world.&#xA;The game play formula follows Street Fighter 2 closely with several playable characters that are essentially the same as the cast of the original Golden Axe (for all extents and purposes).&#xA;It's essentially an elimination tournament with each character having special moves similar to that of Street Fighter 2 characters.

Grand Slam (USA)>Grand Slam>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.>Burst Studios>Sports/Baseball>2.8>1-2 Players>Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.&#xA;Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.&#xA;Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.&#xA;Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.&#xA;Other highlights amongst Grand Slam's feature set included:&#xA;- A trade AI engine that would examine the needs of a team and decide if a proposed trade was in its best interest.&#xA;- Catcher AI and pitch signals, helping a player learn how to pitch to each batter's strengths and weaknesses.&#xA;- Attention to details and baseball flavor, such as players that would blow bubble gum bubbles during an at bat, light- hearted commentary, an All Star Break during season play (complete with a working voting ballot), and an in-game JumboTron scoreboard that would show animations after home runs.
Grid Runner (USA)>Grid Runner>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.>Radical Entertainment>Action>4.4>1-2 Players>Aliens have captured you and you are forced to play a deadly game of what appears to be capture the flag combined with tag. Race your way around the area and capture the required number of flags before being touched by your opponent. If they do touch you, you must find and touch them before they capture the right number of flags. Who ever is "it" cannot capture flags until their opponent is tagged. There is a story and 2 player versus mode. Through the story, you face many different enemies with ranging speeds and firepower (gun fire only slows down the person shot, there is no health bar).
Guardian Heroes (USA)>Guardian Heroes>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Treasure>Role-Playing>3.8>1-6 Players>Treasure's unique scrolling beat-em-up/RPG hybrid, Guardian Heroes introduces the player to a motley crew of heroes (Consisting of a swordsman, a ninja, a cleric and a mage), formed to find a "legendary sword". The game begins with the heroes in a bar, having found this sword, as they decide what to do with it. Before they have a chance to come up with an idea however, they are interrupted as an Imperial General charges in and warns them they are in grave danger. Seconds later, Imperial troops swarm into the inn and the heroes are forced to take flight along with this general.&#xA;The fighting mechanic is slightly deeper than the average scrolling beat-em-up, with light and heavy attacks, special moves (executed the same way you'd expect a normal beat-em-up to work), magical attacks and the ability to block. As you defeat enemies you gain experience points, with which you can upgrade your character between levels - sharing them between various factors such as strength, speed, constitution and magic resistance.&#xA;Even more interesting however is the hugely branching storyline, which changes according to decisions you make (of which there are many) and which character you select to play with.&#xA;Also of note is the fact that even in one-player mode there are always two of you on screen - you command the other character by changing his "mood" - aggressive, cowardly etc. - of which there are six. On top of this, it is possible to play the game as a more traditional beat-em-up with up to six players/bots, and in this mode you can play as any character that you have encountered during the main game mode.

Four weapons are available: the main cannon; a weak machine gun that overheats with prolonged use; clusters of grenades and limited supplies of homing missiles. Damage repair and extra ammo is available from supply helicopters, but these are vulnerable to attack. Ally mechs can be useful, but it is the player who has to do most of the work by far, battling mechs that are sometimes faster and more agile, therefore a certain amount of strategy and planning is required.

Hexen - Beyond Heretic (USA)>Hexen - Beyond Heretic>1997>ESRB - M (Mature)>GT Interactive Software Corp.>Raven Software>Shooter>4.3>1 Player>Hexen is the sequel to Heretic. While the Heretic was destroying D'Sparil, the other two Serpent Riders have come to your dimension and slaughtered everyone. Or so they thought. Three humans have managed to escape with their lives and now seek vengeance against the Serpent Rider Korax who remains in their world.&#xA;Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic's innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage. Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor.&#xA;The hub system steps away from the traditional "single levels stringed along into episodes" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen's hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single "hub" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the "spoke" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels.&#xA;Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases.

There are six hover cars to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga.

When the lawful Pantheon society of superheroes kidnaps the green giant, he joins forces with his abductors and smashes through 13+2 isometric 3D levels (in a look reminiscent of the Loaded series of games).&#xA;True to the comic books, the Hulk relies on no other weapons than his massive muscles to punch, kick and crush his enemies. When he has accumulated enough gamma energy, he may use powerful special moves like a Vortex Spin or the Floor Hammer. Rare bonus items also allow the Hulk to summon one of the four Pantheon team members Atalanta, Ulysses, Ajax and Hector to assist in the thick of battle.&#xA;Most levels include at least one arch-enemy, such as Piecemeal, Trauma & Lazarus or the U-Foes. Luckily, the Hulk's regenerative powers allow him to regain health slowly. Little seems to be left of the Hulk's legendary leaping capacity, however, so the green meat ball is forced to hop from platform to platform every now and then.&#xA;You can find more information on The Incredible Hulk comic books in the trivia and links sections.

A total of 24 ingenious puzzles must be solved, each independent of the others. Most of them can be played in two difficulty levels (Easy or Hard), and the Oracle provides clues to help along the way.&#xA;The graphics for the puzzles are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style. Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off, if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle's well. There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where you begin the game. In each room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.&#xA;The puzzles in this game can be compared to those found in The 7th Guest. The Chinese Checkers puzzle in Shivers rivals many of the ones contained in Jewels of the Oracle.&#xA;Since there is no real story line or deeper meaning behind all this, Jewels is not an adventure game but rather a collection of challenging puzzles.

Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.&#xA;The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields.

Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.&#xA;The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.&#xA;After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.&#xA;Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.

Magic Carpet (USA)>Magic Carpet>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Krisalis Software>Shooter>3.1>1 Player>Magic Carpet is a first-person perspective game, in which you are a mage who flies on a, well, magic carpet and casts spells. The game has 50 levels, called "worlds"; each of those is set in a sea terrain with several mountainous islands. Your goal on each level is to amass enough mana within your castle to "restore the equilibrium" within the world. Once this happens, you can head to the next level.&#xA;To collect mana, you have to find it (it is represented by golden spheres) and cast a specific spell to make it "yours". To collect this mana, you have to use a special spell to raise a castle of your own out of the ground. A balloon will appear over the newly created castle; it will proceed to fly around the level and collect "your" mana. Initially, your castle will be small and won't be able to hold much mana, so you'll have to keep casting the "castle" spell at it to make it bigger.&#xA;The levels typically have monsters and rival mages in them. Not only they can hurt you with their attacks, but killing them is often necessary, as upon death they will release some of the mana you need to complete the level. To attack your enemies, you have a variety of spells at your disposal: fireballs, lightning bolts and meteors.&#xA;There are also many other spells available to you - they allow you to heal yourself, surround yourself with a protective shield, teleport around, summon a skeleton army, or even modify the terrain by creating volcanoes and splitting landmasses. Not all spells are available to you from the beginning, though.&#xA;Throughout all the levels, you are on your flying carpet, which can move in 3 dimensions. You can bring up a top-down map at any time.

The protagonists are all the three girls, but the player can controls only one of them at a time. Each one has advantages and disadvantages, as well as different fighting styles: Hikaru uses swords, Umi a rapier, and Fuu a bow. The player advances through the game by exploring the world, talking to non-playable characters, and fighting enemies in real-time combat.

If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!&#xA;Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the "par" force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before. Let addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's nonetheless a classic.&#xA;If you want them now, get the Titanium Edition, which is 3D accelerated.

Mighty Hits is the Saturn's answer to PlayStation's Point Blank. Up to 8 players can play against each other in this crazy selection of mini games. The quality of games is quite high with only one or two being a bit dull. Visually Mighty Hits is also quite impressive. I played this with the Saturn's mouse and gun and found it a pleasure to play. Playing with the standard controller is ok apart from some challengers such as the Bull's Eye one since that is too easy. This was released in the UK believe it or not so any Europeans reading this may want to look out for a PAL version.

Quake (USA)>Quake>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Lobotomy Software>Shooter>4.4>1 Player>An enemy with the codename 'Quake', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.&#xA;id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.&#xA;In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.&#xA;Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.&#xA;The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel. Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.&#xA;Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.

Road Rash (USA)>Road Rash>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Electronic Arts>Motorcycle>3.5>1-2 Players>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place.&#xA;There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.&#xA;There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.&#xA;If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.&#xA;The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.
Robo Pit (USA)>Robo Pit>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Kokopeli Digital Studios>Altron>Platform>4.0>1-2 Players>Robo Pit is an arena fighter, plain and simple. Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.&#xA;Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of "boss" robot is put in your way. These "bosses" use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!&#xA;The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.
Robotica (USA)>Robotica>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Genki>Action>3.2>1 Player>Robotica was the first firstperson shooter for the platform and a first generation game for the console. It is somewhat similar to Space Hulk, only that the player takes the role of a machine that rebels against the robots to save mankind. The weapons include a punch, Vulcan gun, Missiles, and Lasers. The main environment is made up of various hallways. The player runs through the various stages collecting keys, using computers, and triggering lights. The enemies are relatively basic but are dangerous in numbers.&#xA;The game is set in 2877, 800 years after the world's peacekeeping unions have collapsed. They are replaced with World Silent Security Service, a global world order to maintain the security on earth and in space. However, over time the role of the order is questioned, and the Reformist Faction rebel group sends three pilots in Laocorn assault robots to the WSSS' space station Daedalus in earth's orbit. Two are immediately destroyed, but the player gets to control the remaining robot.
Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV - Wall Of Fire (USA)>Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV - Wall Of Fire>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>KOEI Co., Ltd.>Koei>Strategy>3.3>1-8 Players>The Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history is the setting for this strategic war game. Select one of 38 leaders and guide your people to power by military or diplomatic means in an isometrically viewed world. Military tactics such as well-placed taunts and deliberate enemy confusion are on offer. Weaponry includes catapults and automatic-firing crossbows.
Saturn Bomber Man (Europe)>Saturn Bomber Man>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Hudson Soft>Action>3.7>1-10 Players>An all out party game, this Saturn exclusive title has you controlling the little blue bomber along with up to 10 other bomber pals planting bombs to trap enemy characters.&#xA;Although there is no story mode, you can take on a host of other characters in one on one battles to see who is the master of the bomb. 10 players can then play on the one screen at a time, either against each other or in teams.&#xA;Saturn Bomberman can also connect to the Sega Saturn NetLink internet system, allowing two people from opposite ends of the earth to battle it out.
Scorcher (USA)>Scorcher>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Scavenger, Inc.>Zyrinx>Driving>3.2>1 Player>Scorcher is a futuristic racing game by Scavenger. In dark post-war-looking decors, you race against a couple of opponents driving in a spherical racer. You can pick up special triangles to gain speed powerups.&#xA;The graphics support resolutions up to 640x480.
Scud - The Disposable Assassin (USA)>Scud - The Disposable Assassin>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SegaSoft, Inc.>Syrox Developments>Shooter>4.2>1-2 Players>You play the game as Scud, a "disposable assassin", who has been hired to take out a target in the "Marvin's Manikan" factory. Based on the underground comic by Rob Schrab, Scuds are designed to self destruct after they have destroyed their target... Scud has become aware of this fact, and instead only injures his target enough to not self-destruct. But, being a robot, Scud has no money, and must turn to freelance jobs to pay for his original target's life support.&#xA;The game can be played with either a controller or the Virtua Stunner (or other compatible light gun). With a controller, the game is a side scrolling shoot-em-up; but with a light gun, it becomes a first person shooter. You can play with any combination of controllers and guns, but the game is essentially meant to be played with two guns (Scud himself uses two guns).&#xA;The game is fueled by music from "DJR/IB3 LTD. (Darryl J. Reavis &amp; Illuminado Berrios, III), Fidget-X, and Unbelievable Jolly Machine"
Sea Bass Fishing (Europe)>Sea Bass Fishing>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>JVC Digital Studios>JVC Digital Studios>Sports/Fishing>3.6>1 Player>No more fishy tales, it's time to wind in that dream catch in the comfort of your own home.Follow the instructor's expert advice and choose from an extensive range of tackle developed by the fishing experts at Daiwa.&#xA;From Barracuda to Tuna, watch the bite close up in beautiffuly rendered 3D graphics as the perspective zooms in on the underwater action. With a choice of Tournament and Free Fishing modes you can learn how to be a better fisherman and even fry up you catch in the lodge keeper's kitchen.
Sega Ages (USA)>Sega Ages>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SPAZ>Rutubo Games>Multiplay>4.6>1 Player>A collection of three of Sega's most popular arcade games of the 1980s, translated for the Sega Saturn - Outrun, After Burner II and Space Harrier.&#xA;In Outrun, get behind the wheel of your Ferrari and reach the checkpoints in time. Choose your destination as the road forks, and make sure you make it to the finish line before the timer reads zero.&#xA;After Burner II allows you to fly the most feared jet fighter in the skies - the SSF-14 - and annihilate the enemy. With two Vulcan guns, heat seaking missiles and an afterburner, as well as support from the crew of the aircraft carrier Sega Enterprise, the object is to shoot the enemy from the sky - before they get you.&#xA;Space Harrier is a shoot 'em up set in a fantasy future world. Armed with a gun and a jet pack, it is your job to rid Dragonland of the demon Absymbel and his evil forces.
Sega Rally Championship (USA)>Sega Rally Championship>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Sega>Driving>4.1>1-2 Players>Sega Rally was a major success in the arcades, bringing rally-style racing to the masses before the Colin McRae games. Four detailed tracks have been created, with a succession of stomach-churning bends and jumps, and you can choose from 3 different cars. As well as the main championship, there is a time-trial mode featuring a ghost car to beat, so you always know how your run compares with your best-ever. Two machines can be linked for multi-player action. The handling of the cars is unrealistic, to put the focus on action and instant playability.
Sega Touring Car Championship (USA)>Sega Touring Car Championship>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Europe Ltd.>Sega>Driving>3.5>1-2 Players>After Virtua Racing, Daytona USA and Sega Rally, yet another classic SEGA arcade racer (this time, from the Model 2C CRX architecture) is converted for home users. After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid). Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega.&#xA;Like with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an "Arcade" and a "PC"/"Saturn" mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player.&#xA;As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.&#xA;Another feature was the "Global Ranking" mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan a password containing his times, and compare them to the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only "Global Net Events".
Sega Worldwide Soccer '97 (USA)>Sega Worldwide Soccer '97>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega>Sports/Soccer>4.2>1-4 Players>Well, it's a soccer game made by Sega but with an arcade-like style of gameplay. So the handling is kept pretty straight-forward: one button for a shot towards the enemy goal (from any position on the field), one for passing to teammates and one for lobbing. But simple doesn't mean limited since a couple of things are not explained in the manual and you'll have to figure them out yourself, which can take some time.&#xA;You can choose between dozens of national teams from all over the world. Player names are made up since there's no Fifa license or anything but they're editable if you feel like correcting that. Game modes include Exhibition, Tournament, League or World Cup. You can play either versus the CPU, vs. up to 2 human players or even coop (2 humans vs. the CPU or other 2 humans).
Sega Worldwide Soccer '98 (USA)>Sega Worldwide Soccer '98>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Sega>Sports/Soccer>4.1>1-4 Players>Sega Worldwide Soccer 98 picks up where its predecessor stopped, adding two new stadiums, new animations, faster gameplay, and the most important, club teams from England, Spain and France for a total of 60 teams adding to the 48 of the International mode. While the game still lacks a license (except the English league, that has real player and team names), the name editor is still present. In the commentary box, Gary Bloom is joined by former England international and 1966 World Cup winner Jack Charlton.&#xA;There are seven games modes: Friendly match, Club exhibition, Worldwide Cup, Club League, Cup Tournament and Penalty shootout.
Shanghai - Triple Threat (USA)>Shanghai - Triple Threat>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Activision, Inc.>Activision>Board Games>4.5>1-2 Players>Another version of the ancient game of Mah-Jong. The player is presented with an arrangement of tiles, lined up together and stacked, with either 2 or 4 of each of an array of patterns. These must be removed by matching pairs, but only tiles which are visible and have a space to the left or right can be removed.&#xA;This release in the Activision's Shanghai series includes three games along with the Classic Shanghai. In The Great Wall, the tiles are stacked vertically, and fall when lower tiles are removed, a lá Tetris. In Beijing, gaps are created to slide groups of tiles along. The Golden Tile sees two players attempt to clear a set layout at once. The Triple-theme continues with three game modes: Solitaire, 2-player "Pandamonium", and Arcade. Three themed tile sets complete the "Triple Threat".
Shellshock (USA)>Shellshock>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>U.S. Gold, Inc.>Core Design Ltd.>Action>2.9>1 Player>Da Wardenz, an anti-terrorist tank force, is called in whenever there is trouble somewhere in the world. You are a rookie hired by the tank force and must prove yourself in 25 increasingly difficult missions.&#xA;'The Pen' is Da Wardenz' headquarters. It has all sorts of locations including the main hangar, basketball court, simulation room, workshop area, briefing room and various lockers (used for loading and saving missions). Before a mission, you can explore the headquarters and interact with each member of the team; you may learn something.&#xA;When you start a mission, the action is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has you controlling the M-13 Predator, a highly sophisticated and upgradable tank. The game is arcade-oriented and has much more in common with 'Quarantine' and 'Doom' than serious counterparts like 'M1 Tank Platoon'.&#xA;Your tank has unlimited bullets, can sustain heavy damage and can destroy enemies but also trees and buildings.&#xA;When a mission is successfully completed you earn cash which you can spend on repairing your tank and extra upgrades.
Shining Force III (USA)>Shining Force III>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Camelot Software Planning>Strategy>3.8>1 Player>Set in a world of fantasy and magic, Shining Force III places you in the boots of a young general, fighting to preserve the peace in your world. The story starts out as the Emperor is abducted from within the city of Saraband, and you must go on the run with your king, who is suspected of being the mastermind behind the abduction. Of course, things are not as they seem, and you will be taken through a web of lies and deceit in your quest to prove the King innocent.&#xA;The game is very similar in style to the earlier Shining Force titles, so anyone who's played them will be comfortable with the game, though likely they'll also be happy to find the game graphically overhauled, with a 3-D landscape and 3D characters during the battle animations. As ever the main game is controlled like a traditional RPG, with you controlling the main character, talking to NPC's and searching various items. However, the main selling point of the Shining Force series has always been its battle sequences.&#xA;The combat system is amended from the earlier titles, with a new and unique "friendship" system, whereby the more two characters work together (helping each other out, healing each other etc.) the closer they bond, and they will start to give each other bonuses on the battlefield. Other traditional features, such as the rock-paper-scissors nature of the weapons (sword beats axe, axe beats spear, spear beats sword etc.) and the terrain effects (someone hiding in a forest is going to get better protection than someone on an open road) remain fully intact, and anyone who's played the earlier titles in the series will likely be very comfortable with the combat system.&#xA;It should be noted that this is actually the western conversion of Shining Force III: Episode I, and was therefore only the first episode in an intended series of three. Unfortunately the other two titles were never released outside of Japan, so most western gamers were only able to experience a third of the storyline.
Shining the Holy Ark (USA)>Shining the Holy Ark>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Camelot Software Planning>Role-Playing>4.0>1 Player>Part of the Shining game universe, "Shining the Holy Ark" is a pure console-style RPG (unlike Shining Force games, that were strategy/RPG hybrids). You play the role of a young swordsman Arthur, who decided to work as a mercenary for various people needing his services. On his first mission, the King of Enrich sends him to a mine, in order to find and punish a renegade ninja who has escaped from him. However, an accident occurs that makes Arthur realize that he'll have to do much more than his usual mercenary assignment, and that there is a true evil in the world that must be defeated at all costs.&#xA;The game features 3D graphics and utilizes first-person perspective for dungeons and battles. The turn-based battles are of a traditional Japanese RPG kind, except the addition of "Pixie System". In various places in the game you can find pixies who can later be used as allies in battles.
Shining Wisdom (USA)>Shining Wisdom>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Working Designs>Camelot Software Planning>Role-Playing>4.6>1 Player>Shining Wisdom is the 4th game in the Shining series, but is completely different from the others. Neither a dungeon crawl like Shining in the Darkness, or a tactical battle RPG like Shining Force, the game plays very similarly to Zelda, with its action RPG elements.&#xA;The game proceeds by collecting various items found in dungeons and then combining them with magical orbs to create different spell effects that can be used to tackle enemies and solve the riddles that must be bested to beat each labyrinth.
Shinobi Legions (USA)>Shinobi Legions>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Vic Tokai, Inc.>Sega>Action>3.5>1 Player>A ninjitsu master trains three children: two brothers, Kazuma and Sho, and his own daughter Aya. As they grow up, the oldest boy, Kazuma, becomes obsessed with power and demands to learn the sacred techniques of absolute power. The master refuses, and Kazuma leaves, vowing revenge.&#xA;Many years later, long after the master's death, Kazuma returns with an army. He plots his revenge by kidnapping Aya and thus luring Sho into his hideout. As Sho, you must defeat Kazuma and rescue Aya.&#xA;Shinobi Legions is a side-scrolling action game, similar to Shinobi III. Sho's primary weapons are a sword and a finite number of shurikens, both of which are activated with separate buttons. Sho can learn nearly a dozen sword abilities (spinning slash, downward slash, sword shielding, etc.) by collecting powerups scattered throughout levels. There are also "Fire Dragon" powerups that act as single use ninja magic attacks that damage all enemies onscreen, which is the only ninja magic available to Sho. The 9 levels range from fighting in the jungle to climbing Mount Fuji, where Sho will encounter mostly enemy ninjas and a few animal enemies (eagles, snakes, etc.). Shinobi Legions is the only Shinobi game for the Saturn and is notable for its use of live-action cutscenes and its use of blood (the first in the series).
Shockwave Assault (USA)>Shockwave Assault>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Paradox Development>Simulation>3.5>1 Player>Shockwave Assault combines Shock Wave and its expansion Operation Jumpgate and makes them available for systems other than the 3DO for the first time.&#xA;In Shock Wave, the player takes the role of a rookie pilot, defending the Earth from an alien invasion. From the cockpit of the F-177 fighter, one shoots at the alien walkers and fighters with lasers and missiles, rearming and refueling at supply depots when necessary. The story is told with live-action cutscenes.&#xA;Operation Jumpgate continues the story with several further missions, set around the solar system.
SimCity 2000 (USA)>SimCity 2000>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Maxis Software Inc.>Maxis>Strategy>4.0>1 Player>SimCity 2000 is the successor to the ground breaking city simulation game Sim City. You are once again the mayor, but this time you can fully customize the terrain before building your city. The graphics are isometric, whereas the original had graphics displayed in a top-down fashion.&#xA;This title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building "light" zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.
Skeleton Warriors (USA)>Skeleton Warriors>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Playmates Interactive Entertainment, Inc.>Neversoft Entertainment>Platform>4.4>1 Player>You're Prince Lightstar, with the quest to conquer and slay Baron Dark, who holds the half of a mighty crystal called the Lightstar Crystal. With that crystal he can change anyone with an evil heart into his skeleton slave.&#xA;The game is a 2D sidescrolling platform game with 3D pre-rendered graphics, with about 100 types of enemies for you to slay with the weapons you possess. You need to complete 21 levels filled with demonic evil creatures before you can fight the Baron Dark himself, with 3D rendered cutscenes inbetween some levels.
Sky Target (USA)>Sky Target>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega>Action>3.5>1 Player>Another 3rd person perspective arcade flight sim by Sega, similar to their classic After Burner in gameplay but featuring new gameplay mechanics and an entirely polygonal engine.&#xA;As in most games of it's type your objective is to clear a number of stages by shooting anything that moves, but at the end of each stage you can select where to go next thanks to branching paths a-la Darius, which coupled with 4 different planes to select give the game an increased gameplay value. No multiple lives are given, but you get a life bar (which can be replenished in-flight) to help you outlast your enemies.
Slam 'N Jam '96 featuring Magic & Kareem (USA)>Slam 'N Jam '96 featuring Magic & Kareem>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Crystal Dynamics, Inc.>Left Field Productions>Sports/Basketball>3.7>1-4 Players>A fast paced 5-on-5 basketball game very similar to the Run and Gun series from Konami. This game features no real NBA license but two real legends: Earvin "Magic" Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. There are player stats and skills for each player which are modeled to be similar to their actual NBA counterparts. Features exhibition, season and playoff modes.
Solar Eclipse (USA)>Solar Eclipse>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Crystal Dynamics, Inc.>Crystal Dynamics>Simulation>3.8>1 Player>Solar Eclipse is a 3D shooter that takes place on and near the many moons of Saturn. You are a hot-shot pilot with a troubled past. You've been re-assigned to a new squadron aboard a Tomlinson-class carrier. There's trouble on a mining colony on the moon Janus. Your squadron is sent in to investigate, and uncover a lot more than they went looking for.&#xA;Solar Eclipse plays kind of like a sequel to Total Eclipse for the 3DO. Gameplay is pure arcade-style shooter. You can view the game from a behind-the-ship perspective, or an in-cockpit perspective, but the scrolling is on rails. You can only travel in one direction. In each of the 9 missions you will find wave after wave of enemy ships, and a powerful boss ship at the end.&#xA;The story in this game is told through a series of full-motion video clips. In addition to between-level scenes, FMV messages from your squad mates appear from time to time while you play the game.
Sonic 3D Blast (USA)>Sonic 3D Blast>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Traveller's Tales>Platform>3.2>1 Player>While visiting Flicky Island, Sonic notices that the Flickies, his small, feathered friends that can travel between parallel worlds, were captured and turned into badniks (the robot enemies of Sonic) by Dr. Robotnik in his never-ending quest for the Chaos Emeralds. Seven levels separate Sonic from the final showdown with Robotnik.&#xA;Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare appearances in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also left and right.&#xA;Gameplay is much slower when compared to other games in the series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an interdimensional ring. While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue tokens.&#xA;Unlike all other previous games, time isn't a requirement: if the player completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no time bonus at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.
Sonic Jam (USA)>Sonic Jam>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sonic Team>Multiplay>4.3>1-2 Players>A compilation of Sonic's greatest 2D adventures. Included on the disk is the original Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic 2 (featuring Tails), Sonic 3 plus Sonic & Knuckles.&#xA;Each game has you taking control of Sonic (and later on in the series, Tails and Knuckles) who must use his speed to blast his way through level after level and rescuing his animal friends from the evil Dr. Robotnik. Along the way you will also enjoy 3rd person bonus rounds and take on a host of end of level bosses.&#xA;Exclusive to the Saturn compilation is the Sonic 3D museum, which allows you to control a 3D animated Sonic through a world full of historical information on the Sonic series, including behind the scenes, details on the characters from each game, artwork and more.
Sonic R (USA)>Sonic R>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Traveller's Tales>Driving>3.6>1-2 Players>While on vacation, Tails and Sonic come across a recruiting advertisement for the World Grand Prix race. Sonic is not interested at first, but once he notices that Dr. Robotnik will participate he decides to enter. Robotnik is only interested in the race because he's learned the location of the Chaos Emeralds and now he'll get a chance to beat Sonic while he gets them. Knuckles finds out that Sonic will participate, so he joins him. Amy overhears Robotnik's plan, so she will also be racing to get the Chaos Emeralds.&#xA;There are many modes of gameplay in Sonic R:&#xA;Grand Prix: You race against the rest of the characters on each of the circuits, and get a chance to race the level's boss to unlock some of the extra playable characters.&#xA;Time Attack: Run on one of the tracks as fast as you can, get 5 balloons or tag 4 characters.&#xA;Multi Player: 4 players on a split-screen or over a network. You can race against up to three players or challenge them on a balloon finding game. The screen can be divided horizontally or vertically for 2 player games.
Soviet Strike (USA)>Soviet Strike>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>EA Tiburon>Action>3.5>1 Player>In 1991, the U.S.S.R. (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) boasting the largest military force in history, suddenly and unexpectedly collapsed. Since that time the fallen empire has lain lifeless -- a rich corpse waiting to be picked clean. Now, a sinister ex-KGB general codenamed Shadowman directs a flock of vultures to swoop in from all parts of Eastern Europe and claim Russia's nuclear warheads and weapons of mass terror. While directing these 'wars of liberation' Shadowman intends to shake democratic Russia to it's foundations, bringing about a return to the Cold War...or even worse. You chopper into Crimea and discover the plot of this Russian madman using thermal spy devices. You must quickly move on to the Black Sea to prevent the hijacking of ICBM ships, respond to an attack on a chemical weapons plant in the desert passes, and then recover a nuclear reactor core in Transylvania. As you successfully thwart these stages of Operation Vulture, Shadowman is forced to take his coup to the streets of Moscow. Guide your chopper through five unique 3D worlds as you complete 41 deadly missions.

Space Hulk - Vengeance of the Blood Angels (USA)>Space Hulk - Vengeance of the Blood Angels>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Krisalis Software>Shooter>3.8>1 Player>Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is a mix of a First-Person-Shooter and a tactical fighting game. It is placed in the&#xA;Warhammer 40k background of the Games Workshop table top games.&#xA;It is the successor of the PC game Space Hulk from 1993 and it tells of the fight between the imperial Terminator Chapters and the Tyranid Gene Stealers.&#xA;You control up to ten Terminators. You give them orders in a tactical screen and/or take over one of them and then move in a 3D environment and fight the Gene Stealers just as in a First- Person-Shooter. So the game includes tactical planning and fighting in a good balance.
Space Invaders (Japan)>Space Invaders>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Taito Corporation>Taito Corporation>Shoot->2.8>1-2 Players>This version of Space Invaders is based on the 1994 arcade game Space Invaders DX but lacks the parody mode of that game. What remains is the classic mode that allows the player to choose the type of arcade cabinet (upright, black & white, etc.) as background to the action as well as the versus mode for two players. The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.
Space Jam (USA)>Space Jam>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Sculptured Software>Sports/Basketball>4.1>1-6 Players>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.&#xA;The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.&#xA;Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.&#xA;The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.&#xA;The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.&#xA;There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.&#xA;The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.&#xA;There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.
Spot Goes to Hollywood (USA)>Spot Goes to Hollywood>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.>Burst Studios>Platform>3.8>1 Player>The central character in this game is Spot, the little red guy from the 7-Up TV commercials. Spot has somehow become trapped in a movie projector. As he jumps from film to film, he encounters many classic film genres that make up all the different levels of the game. The main levels are a pirate movie, an adventure movie, and a horror movie, but there are many other bonus films to unlock.&#xA;The game is played from an isometric perspective. As you control spot, you have to collect 5 Hollywood stars per level to unlock hidden areas and ultimately complete the game 100%.
Star Fighter (USA)>Star Fighter>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Krisalis Software>Shooter>3.4>1 Player>3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being "convinced" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.&#xA;A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, and must keep moving at all times. Two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.&#xA;One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.&#xA;The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn't a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame.
Steep Slope Sliders (USA)>Steep Slope Sliders>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Cave>Sports/Snowboarding>4.5>1 Player>A snowboarding game in the CoolBoarders vein, this game sees you picking one of a motley crew of boarders and taking to the slopes as you try to get the best times and/or scores on each slope.&#xA;With a range of tricks and courses, from Canada to Italy to Japan, as well as the option to play on a half-pipe purely for points, this game offers a fast-paced snowboarding experience that's easy for anyone to just hop into.
Street Fighter - The Movie (USA)>Street Fighter - The Movie>1995>ESRB - T (Teen)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Incredible Technologies>Fighter>2.5>1-2 Players>Street Fighter: The Movie is a 2D beat 'em up game based on the movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the well known Capcom series, Street Fighter. Using digitized animation based on the actors and the many locations featured in the film, the same style of gameplay found in Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II Turbo is used here. Select from a range of fighters (including Ryu, Ken, Guile, M. Bison and Chun Li) each with their own set of special moves, and defeat all of the opposition to become the King of Street Fighting.&#xA;Also included is a story mode which follows the story of the movie and uses FMV in-between fights and a Trial Battle Mode, where you take on Guile in a range of different battle events to test your skills.
Street Fighter Alpha - Warrior's Dreams (USA)>Street Fighter Alpha - Warrior's Dreams>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom Entertainment, Inc.>Capcom>Fighter>3.5>1-2 Players>It's Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.&#xA;The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.&#xA;The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.
Street Fighter Alpha 2 (USA)>Street Fighter Alpha 2>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom Entertainment, Inc.>Capcom>Fighter>3.6>1-2 Players>Another Street Fighter sequel (this time for Street Fighter Alpha) adds even more to the classic fighting series.&#xA;New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves. Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.&#xA;The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)

The US version of the game is a port of the arcade game Strikers 1945 II. The Japanese PlayStation version of the game is entirely different, as it includes the port of Strikers 1945 but was also released with the PSX title Strikers 1945.
Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo (USA)>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Capcom>Puzzle>4.4>1-2 Players>A Tetris-like puzzle game featuring popular characters from many Capcom games.&#xA;Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.

Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.&#xA;Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.&#xA;You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages.

Dropped into a series of locations, one or two players must arm up and shoot their way through three death filled levels, in an attempt to restore peace and order.

As these are hidden away in crates and the like, finding these weapons is an important part of the game and they can give players extra firepower when they most need it. In particular, such weapons can be extremely useful when trying to take on the customary end-of-level bosses. Made of stern stuff, you'll need all the help you can get in dispatching them off to hell.
Virtua Cop 2 (USA)>Virtua Cop 2>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega AM2>Gun>4.1>1-2 Players>Virtua Cop 2 follows the same gameplay pattern of its predecessor. You are a police officer sent after criminals, from subways and a bank to aboard helicopters. The game moves you automatically, although you can find hiding places to shoot from a safe angle.

Virtua Fighter (USA)>Virtua Fighter>1994>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega AM2>Fighter>4.2>1-2 Players>Virtua Fighter was the first of it's kind: A one-on-one fighting game featuring fully 3D environments and characters. The fighters and arenas are rendered in flat-shaded polygons. Unlike many fighting games, Virtua Fighter focuses on deep gameplay based on actual fighting styles, rather than outrageous special moves and story lines.&#xA;There are 8 fighters to choose from in Virtua Fighter, and an equal number of fighting backdrops in which to compete. Each fighter has a distinctive fighting style, and their own set of signature moves.
Virtua Fighter 2 (USA)>Virtua Fighter 2>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega AM2>Fighter>4.1>1-2 Players>One year after after the first tournament Akira, Wolf, Pai, Jeffry, Kage, Jacky, Sarah and defending champion Lau are invited to the World Fighting Tournament, and are joined by the master of drunken Kung-Fu Shun-di, who wants to prove he's more than an old geezer and Lion Rafale, who's fighting for his freedom. Each fighter has his own style, from the lightning fast attacks of Pai to the powerful slams of Jeffry.&#xA;Home port of Sega's popular Model 2A arcade vs. fighter released in 1995. Game modes include classic arcade mode, 2P vs mode, Expert mode (where the computer character progressively learns and counters players' technique), Ranking Mode (similar to Arcade, but at the end, a fighting style analysis is shown based on number of specials and time to knock down an opponent), Team Battle Mode (two teams composed of five fighters go against each other, the first to beat five characters being the winner) and Watch mode (allows choosing two fighters and then see them fighting). Both VF2 and VF2.1 (a tweaked version available only in Japan) modes are included. Gameplay keeps the same style from the first game, adding more moves to each fighters' roll. Using a three-key layout (block, kick and punch, being possible to assign button combinations to the extra keys) the player is able to control their fighter, aiming to knock or push the opponent outside the rink inside the time limit. Combo moves range from the quickest, which require the player to push up to five buttons quickly, to strong moves that require more button presses along d-pad nudges to be successful. As with the previous game, fighting is realistic (except the physics-defying leaps), and each fighter has nothing but their body to harm the opponent.&#xA;While in comparison with the arcade version some parts took a hit on graphical quality (such as the texture details and backgrounds), the game uses the Saturn High-Resolution mode and flowing 60-fps to bring the arcade experience home.
Virtua Fighter Kids (USA)>Virtua Fighter Kids>1996>ESRB - T (Teen)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Sega AM2>Fighter>4.1>1-2 Players>Virtua Fighter Kids is a modified version of Virtua Fighter 2 for Sega Saturn.

VR Soccer (USA)>VR Soccer>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>VR Sports>Gremlin Interactive>Sports/Soccer>3.4>1-2 Players>In 1995 the increased power of the new wave of systems made 3D football games a possibility several companies investigated. Most of the features people later took for granted in football games were pioneered, or at least fairly fresh, when they appeared in the first of the Actua Sports titles.&#xA;Multiple camera angles were available to view the full-3D action, with 3 Sheffield Wednesday FC players providing motion capture. 44 international squads of 22 players each were featured, each with 8 individual skill attributes.

Whizz (Europe)>Whizz>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Konami Deutschland GmbH>Flair Software Ltd.>Action>3.0>1 Player>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren't always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you'd logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy -this reduces the significance of the points system.
Wing Arms (USA)>Wing Arms>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Sega>Flying>3.6>1 Player>Wing Arms is action/shooter starring airplanes mainly from the WW2 era. There is very little simulation here as you shoot your way through levels where usually your mission is to shoot everyone, or to bomb certain targets. Night missions add to the variety. Gameplay is similar to the Wing Commander series, and is intended to be easy to play but hard to master.

Winter Heat (USA)>Winter Heat>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega AM3 R&D Division>Sega>Sports/Skiing>3.2>1-4 Players>Winter Heat is the home conversion of the DecAthlete (also known as Athlete Kings) sequel, replacing decathlon by Winter sports. Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena).&#xA;The game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:&#xA;1. Speed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.&#xA;2. Ski Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).&#xA;3. Downhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump hills perfectly.&#xA;4. Short Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.&#xA;5. Skeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.&#xA;6. Slalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.&#xA;7. Aerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a "click-along" version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button presses&#xA;8. Bobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.&#xA;9. Speed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the power bar.&#xA;10. Snowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.&#xA;11. Cross Country:&#xA; The stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.

Z (Europe)>Z>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>GT Interactive Software Europe Ltd.>Prolific>Shooter>3.3>1 Player>Real-time strategy game with a difference: you fight for control of the sectors, some of which contains manufactories which can gain you additional units. Touch the "flag" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments and armor and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent's base... And prevent him from doing the same to you...&#xA;Z differs from other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a bit army. You have finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long enemy will grab all the manufactories first. If you go too fast you'll get hammered for stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle. It's these little touches that makes Z an underappreciated title, as you don't really need to micromanage each soldier.
