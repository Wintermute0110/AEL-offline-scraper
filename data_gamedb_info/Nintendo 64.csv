It's up to our Agent 007 to venture to Soviet Union once again, and to put an end to Janus' ambitions.&#xA;In this 3D action game, you control James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate your foes. However, many parts require you to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to your presence and alarm their comrades.

The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options, and three difficulty levels.

California Speed (USA)>California Speed>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Midway>Atari Games Corporation>Driving>2.5>1-4 Players>California Speed has you racing through, of course, California, with a range of different and unique tracks based on the real life maps of the US state, with short-cuts and branching elements adding elements of strategy when racing to the finish line.

Carmageddon 64 (USA)>Carmageddon 64>1999>ESRB - M (Mature)>Titus Software>Stainless Software Ltd.>Driving>2.8>1-2 Players>Motorized carnage. Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race? Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).&#xA;At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.&#xA;Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.
Castlevania - Legacy of Darkness (USA)>Castlevania - Legacy of Darkness>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Konami>Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe, Inc.>Platform>3.1>1 Player>4 games are waiting for you in this sequel to the first Castlevania Nintendo 64 adventure. Although at war with the same enemy in the same castle, you must fight as 4 different characters to save the day, with improved graphics and a new look to certain areas that appeared in the original.&#xA;To begin with, set 8 years before the events that took place in Castlevania, the Count has kidnapped the young sister of Cornell, a powerful werewolf. As Cornell, you must battle your way through the castle and defeat Dracula to save your sister.&#xA;Once completing the game as Cornell, you take up the role of Henry, a demon hating hero who must save captured children from the hands of Dracula within a set time limit.&#xA;After that, you can then take on Dracula once again as the original heroes of Castlevania 64, Reinhardt Schneider and Carrie Fernandez, and re-live the events of the previous game through new and improved surroundings.
Castlevania (USA) (Rev B)>Castlevania>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>Konami>Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe, Inc.>Platform>3.0>1 Player>Konami's long-running series of Castlevania games makes its debut on the N64. The traditional 2D graphics have been left behind; this is the first Castlevania game in 3D. However, the goal of the game remains the same: kick some vampire butt as you battle the evil Count Dracula and his minions in this platformer.&#xA;The player can either choose to be Reinhardt Schneider (for the traditional whip action) or Carrie Fernandez (who uses magical powers). Both characters have their own story line. A nice feature is the presence of an in-game clock which changes the time of the day (either day or night).&#xA;Reinhardt &amp; Carrie both appear again in the second Castlevania game for the N64: Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, which has new layouts for the levels of this game.
Centre Court Tennis (Europe)>Centre Court Tennis>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>BigBen Interactive>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.>Sports/Tennis>3.7>1-4 Players>Centre Court Tennis is a tennis game that does not take itself too seriously. After creating your Lego-like character, you are set to go!&#xA;The basic game features a multiplayer mode (up to 4 players), a tournament mode and an exhibition mode. You also have four mini-games, "Tennis Court Bingo", "Burning Barrels", "Run and Gun" & Knock'em Down", where your goal is to hit certain objects in the tennis field. You can win special prices for getting enough points.&#xA;Additionally, you have a special challenge mode where you have to play against your opponent in odd conditions - your tennis field might be rotating, made from ice or about to explode, to name a few. Beat your foe and you will be rewarded with a piece clothing or item of your choosing from your opponent's dressing room. Lose and you lose an item that your opponent picked. Keep on losing and you have to play your games wearing nothing but your underwear, which makes the game like a sort of family-friendly strip tennis.
Chameleon Twist (USA)>Chameleon Twist>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SunSoft>Japan System Supply>Platform>3.2>1-4 Players>Davy the chameleon is minding his own business, when a rabbit catches his eye. Following the rabbit into its hole, he soon finds himself transformed into a super, alien chameleon, with an extra long tongue. Stuck in an unknown world, he must use his new strength to find his way out back to his home.&#xA;Using the analog stick, you can control Davy's tongue to catch enemies and throw them back as bullets, grab onto to distant poles and ledges for a quick way through the land, or perform tricks like tongue-pole vault, in which he can reach even higher distances by using his tongue as a pole vault.
Chameleon Twist 2 (USA)>Chameleon Twist 2>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SunSoft>Japan System Supply>Platform>3.4>1 Player>After finding his way back home from his first adventure, Davy decides to relax with his friends. However, while playing on the see-saw, a huge rabbit falls from the sky, sending Davy head long into the sky. So once again, using his long tounge to attack enemies and grab onto distant ledges, Davy must find his way home from the land in the sky.&#xA;For the second adventure, you can now choose from 4 different Chameleon's, Davy and friends Linda, Fred and Jack.&#xA;And as well as using his tongue, Davy can also use a parasol to float across large gaps.
Charlie Blast's Territory (USA)>Charlie Blast's Territory>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Kemco>Realtime Associates, Inc.>Action>3.1>1-4 Players>Charlie Blast is a construction worker, but quite different than his more famous colleague. Charlie has a convincing beer belly, he has trouble keeping his jeans up (yup, you will get a nice view of his crack quite frequently) and his chest hair makes David Hasselhoff feel ashamed about himself. He is not trying to save a princess either; his mission is to blow islands up with TNT!&#xA;With 3D graphics and some platform elements, Charlie Blast's Territory, a remake of Kablooey, is a modernization of one of the classic puzzle genres where your goal is to push crates into the correct spots.&#xA;Every level is an island. On every island you have at least one bomb and one TNT box. Your goal is to push all of them next to each others and then blow everything up in a huge chain reaction. When you do, you advance a level. You cannot pull the crates but you can climb over them.
Chopper Attack (USA)>Chopper Attack>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>Midway>SETA Corporation>Action>2.5>1 Player>In Chopper Attack, you take a chopper and.. well.. attack! You get to choose between eight different attack choppers, each having its own strengths and weaknesses.&#xA;After the briefing from your XO, you are set to destroy something - tanks, other helicopters, planes, radars, buildings etc. While the mission only requires you to do something specific, destroying everything gives you bonuses and money, which you can then use to buy more heavy-duty missiles between the missions.&#xA;If you look at the screenshots, you might think that Chopper Attack is a helicopter simulation. It's not. Your elevation is fixed. There are no physics. You have boss fights with GIANT choppers. The game is pure 3D action, plain and simple.
Clay Fighter - Sculptor's Cut (USA)>Clay Fighter - Sculptor's Cut>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>Interplay Entertainment Corp.>Interplay Entertainment Corp.>Fighter>3.1>1-2 Players>Let's Get Ready to Crumble!&#xA;Clay Fighter: Sculptor's Cut is a parody of one-on-one fighting games and features sixteen playable clay (!) fighters, including Sumo Santa, Statue of Liberty, Booger Man and the legendary Earthworm Jim himself! It is the sequel to Clay Fighter 63 1/3 and famous for only being released as a Blockbuster rental exclusive.&#xA;Like the title suggests, it is not an entirely new game but rather a different version of it. The most notable differences are the four extra playable characters and a 2D-style fixed camera angle. You cannot perform unlimited combos anymore either.&#xA;Moves are a mix of standard punches & kicks (although not all of the contestants have hands nor legs to begin with) and a large number of unique special moves and combos for all. You can sometimes interact with your environment by kicking your opponent through a door or window and continue on the other side. You can also end the fights with Mortal Kombat-style "Claytalities".
Clay Fighter 63 1-3 (USA)>Clay Fighter 63 1-3>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Interplay Entertainment Corp.>Interplay Entertainment Corp.>Fighter>3.2>1-2 Players>In this zany beat 'em up, clay animated fighters clash in a fight to the clay death. Characters such as Bad Mr. Frosty (a snowman gone terribly bad), Blob (a green pile of slime), Bonker the nightmare clown and a host more are available to choose from, each with a range of moves that no clay animated character has ever attempted before (such as throwing chickens, clay, and plenty of other objects, including themselves).&#xA;Graphics are a combination of 2D clay animated characters and 3D designed foregrounds/backgrounds.
Command & Conquer (USA)>Command & Conquer>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Nintendo>Looking Glass Studios, Inc.>Strategy>3.6>1 Player>Command & Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.&#xA;The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.&#xA;In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.&#xA;The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.
Conker's Bad Fur Day (USA)>Conker's Bad Fur Day>2001>ESRB - M (Mature)>Rare Ltd.>Rare, Ltd.>Platform>3.9>1-4 Players>Unlike every other Nintendo game ever made, Conker sees his first outing on the N64 with a mature audience in mind. But don't let the violence get in your way of playing this title, which is much like other Rare platformers including Banjo-Kazooie, with a twist.&#xA;In this case, Conker has had one hell of a night, and when he wakes up not only does he have a huge hangover, but something just doesn't feel right. So it's up to Conker and his many skills to clean things up.&#xA;Conker goes through plenty of wild and wacky levels, most of which are based on classic movies including The Matrix, Jaws, Aliens, The Terminator and even Eyes Wide Shut. A multiplayer mode is also included, allowing 4 players to battle it out in many different styles of multiplayer gameplay.
Cruis'n Exotica (USA)>Cruis'n Exotica>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Midway>Midway Home Entertainment, Inc.>Driving>3.2>1-2 Players>The sequel to Cruis'n World both in the arcades and on Nintendo 64, Cruis'n Exotica lets you race against the computer or up to three other opponents in a wide variety of cars and locales. Game mechanics follow "arcade" rules, which include "turbos" to accelerate to (and raise) maximum speed, and any deviation off of the track bumps you right back on it.&#xA;Cars range from sportcars to more esoteric cars like trucks, minis, and police vehicles. Tracks model real life (Alaska, India, Korea, etc.) and eventually branch out into fantasy worlds (Atlantis, Amazon, Mars).
Cruis'n USA (USA) (Rev B)>Cruis'n USA>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Midway Games, Inc.>Driving>2.9>1-2 Players>Originally an arcade machine, Cruis'n USA was then released for the Nintendo 64. The game asks players to choose from seven vehicles to race in a variety of courses (based on real locations) throughout the USA. Various pre-game options included are the choice of automatic or manual transmission, various controller configurations, as well as background music selection option.&#xA;Players take control of the vehicle from a third-person perspective, and while avoiding various hazards along the way, must beat the clock as well as the CPU controlled rivals to gain first-place.&#xA;With fourteen courses to ultimately choose from, Cruis'n USA takes players on a tour across some of the most famous and notorious roads and highways across the continent. Some of the locations include: Golden Gate Park, Redwood Forest, Beverly Hills and the Grand Canyon.
Cruis'n World (USA)>Cruis'n World>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Midway>Driving>3.5>1-4 Players>Pack your bags and prepare for a first class trip around the world. Your ticket is courtesy of Midway, who has transformed its arcade mega-hit Cruis'n World into an all-new racer for the N64.&#xA;Cruis'n USA thrilled racers with a scenic trip across the highways of America, but this time the action will take you all around the world. Each track is packed full of realistic scenery and authentic landmarks, so playing this game could save you a lot of dough on travel expenses. You can catch a glimpse of the Sphinx, the Statue of Liberty, and the Mayan ruins without leaving the security of your living room couch.&#xA; If you're looking for a realistic racing simulation with real world physics, then this is definitely not the game for you. The graphics are realistic, but the actual game play is twisted to the extreme. Even though blazing across the Great Wall of China may be unbelievable, it certainly is fun. You can leap-frog over a semi truck with a police car, or perform a back flip with a military ATV. Add to this a bonus race that takes place on the moon, and you have a good idea of Midway's over-the-top execution of the Cruis'n concept.&#xA;Many of us will never get the chance to visit the Egyptian pyramids, let alone the opportunity to drive a screaming ambulance straight through them. Cruis'n World provides fun fantasy racing action, and the best thing about it is that you won't have to worry about your luggage getting left behind in Russia.
CyberTiger (USA)>CyberTiger>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electronic Arts>Saffire Corporation>Golf/Sports>3.3>1-4 Players>A step back from the Tiger Woods PGA simulation style, Cyber Tiger Woods has a more arcade feel to it, with cartoony style animations, fast gameplay and added elements to make the game of golf more fun then the real life counterpart.&#xA;Although real life elements are there, including full motion capture of Tiger himself, recreations of some of the best PGA tour courses, and the full range of moves (putting, chipping, driving, etc.), arcade elements such as 2 player battle mode, zany characters including Little Tiger, and game types that have you aiming to knock down the opposing character from his platform above a poll of lava, and you will soon notice how different Cyber really is.&#xA;Other game types include a full practise range, skins tournaments and stroke play. Plus there are hidden characters to unlock, equipment upgrades and power-ups plus trick shots you just won't see on the PGA tour
Dark Rift (USA)>Dark Rift>1997>ESRB - T (Teen)>Vic Tokai>Kronos Digital Entertainment>Fighter>3.1>1-2 Players>The cosmos is controlled by two Prime Elements, known as "Core" and "Dark". Each is possessed by a tyrant who is in perpetual search of the third element, the Light, which would grant its owner tremendous power. Sonork Nezom, the carrier of Core Element, has organized a fighting tournament, with Core Element itself being the prize. He hopes that the carrier of the Light Element will be among the participants. He plans then to strike and gain possession of all the elements at once. But Lord Demon Demitron, the carrier of the Dark Element, has other plans...&#xA;In this one-on-one fighting game, the player can take any of the eight playable participants through the tournament mode. Once the selected hero has defeated his opponents, he will have to face battles against Sonork and Demitron. A practice mode is also available. During the fights the player can use standard attacks common for all the characters - vertical and horizontal punches, kicks, running jumps, etc. Each character also possesses an arsenal of special techniques, which can be executed by pressing different buttons in rapid succession.
Deadly Arts (USA)>Deadly Arts>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>Konami>Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka Co., Ltd.>Fighter>2.4>1-2 Players>Fight as a range of characters from around the globe in training, one-on-one and tournament modes. Simple defeat each fighter that stands before you to progress through the ranks until you defeat everyone. Each fighter has a set of basic moves and special moves to use.&#xA;Along with 2 player multiplayer options, you can also create your own fighter and train him/her up to the elite level.
Destruction Derby 64 (USA)>Destruction Derby 64>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>THQ>Looking Glass Studios, Inc.>Driving>3.4>1-4 Players>Much like other Destruction Derby titles, the aim of the game is to race through to the finish, while taking out the other cars for points and not crashing out yourself.&#xA;In this addition, up to 4 players can play, with options including a straight out Derby, Capture the Flag, arena battles and much more.&#xA;There are 12 single player tracks to go through, and plenty of cars to use, including a taxi car (which you must complete the game to unlock).
Diddy Kong Racing (USA) (En,Fr) (Rev A)>Diddy Kong Racing>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Rare, Ltd.>Driving>3.8>1-4 Players>It's an island takeover when the evil space wizard, Wizpig, discovers Tiger Island! After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return. Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.&#xA;Diddy Kong Racing is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons. However, the similarities end there. DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the "Silver Coin Challenge". In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).&#xA;The game also features a strategic method of using weapons. Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times). This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.&#xA;Up to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game. There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time)"
Donald Duck - Goin' Quackers (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)>Donald Duck - Goin' Quackers>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Ubisoft>Ubi Soft SARL>Adventure>3.3>1 Player>You play as Donald in this 3d platform action game. Donald's girlfriend, Daisy is a reporter for a television station in Duckberg. While doing a story on the secret temple of Merlock, a terrible magician, Daisy is kidnapped. Now, it is up to Donald to get her back. Along the way he will have help from his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and the inventor Gyro Gearloose. He will also have competition from Gladstone Gander, who is also trying to save Daisy.&#xA;Game play alternates between side-scrolling running and jumping and 3d running and jumping. The side scrolling levels play a lot like the Super Mario Bros. games. The 3d levels play a lot like the Crash Bandicoot series of games. All in all, there are 20 levels, spread out through areas.
Donkey Kong 64 (USA)>Donkey Kong 64>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Rare Ltd.>Rareware>Platform>3.7>1-4 Players>Donkey Kong 64 is similar to Rareware's other Nintendo 64 platformer series, Banjo Kazooie, but starring Donkey Kong and his friends from the Donkey Kong Country games. Several new features have been added to the game, like being able to change between different characters with different weapons and abilities.&#xA;As with many platformer games players will run around the various levels, jumping, swimming, and climbing where needed. Each level has multiple objectives, such as collecting DK's stolen golden bananas, collecting bananas color coded to each of the five characters, and miscellaneous other objects that need to be found to eventually complete 100% of the game. The player starts only being able to choose Donkey Kong, and must rescue the other four characters from the early levels before they can be used. By visiting Cranky Kong in each level more moves can be learned for each character, allowing them to complete challenges and reach sections in levels that were previously inaccessible.
Doom 64 (USA) (Rev A)>Doom 64>1997>ESRB - M (Mature)>Midway>Midway Games, Inc.>Shooter>3.9>1 Player>DOOM 64 picks up where all the other DOOM games left off.

Sadly, there are a few missing from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray.&#xA;Presentation: The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now).&#xA;However, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren't nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off.&#xA;A 4 player mode has also been included, where you can take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single player missions.

The outrageous jumps and precision timing required in the original have been translated into a modern 3D racing game.&#xA;There are several game modes to choose from. First, there is a season mode with multiple skill levels. Completing a 5-race season in first place unlocks special tracks and more difficult classes. Second, there is a exhibition mode which allows you and up to 3 other people to choose a single track to race on. Third, there is a time trial mode in which you try to get the best times on the 20 tracks.&#xA;Finally. there are multiple special tracks.

Excitebike 64 also includes a track editor for building your own competitions.

F-1 World Grand Prix (USA)>F-1 World Grand Prix>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Video System>Paradigm Entertainment Inc.>Driving>4.3>1-2 Players>The 1997 Formula One World Championship, won by Canadian Jacques Villeneuve in dramatic fashion after a final-race collision with Germany's Michael Schumacher, is recreated in this racing simulation. You have the chance to set up the car to perfect the handling for each of the 17 diverse circuits. Wet racing is incorporated, with gradual weather chances, as well as tyre wear requiring pitstops.&#xA;In total there are five distinct gameplay modes.

F-Zero X (USA)>F-Zero X>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Nintendo EAD>Driving>3.9>1-4 Players>Famed SNES racer F-Zero got this N64 update. Gameplay remains essentially unchanged, race in a futuristic racing tournament on tracks levitated miles up in the air, against a selection of devious opponents.&#xA;Where the original had 4 cars to choose from and race against, F-Zero X has no fewer than 30 vehicles all with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, a choice of colours, and customisable power/acceleration ratios for each track. At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6 tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks are unlocked as you progress through the game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial mode, against a 'ghost car' recording of your best previous lap, a lÃ¡ Mario Kart 64.&#xA;Gone are the entirely flat tracks of the original, having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy shapes you could imagine. One unique feature amongst almost all other racing games is the "X" tournament, where courses are totally randomly generated each time you start.&#xA;One of the most important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 players. The various combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play.&#xA;This game has a rock soundtrack, which I believe is the first game soundtrack ever to feature the bestial grunting found only in death metal music.

VS. Battle allows you to defeat the enemy, then acquire their moves for the next round. The Master Challenge has you spinning a wheel to determine who your fight.

Atari has delivered a far meatier storyline, though, spiffed up by cinema cut-scenes at the successful conclusion of a world.

Jet Force Gemini (USA)>Jet Force Gemini>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Rare Ltd.>Rare Ltd.>Shooter>3.6>1-4 Players>Twins Juno and Vela, and their dog Lupus, are Jet Force Gemini, intergalactic police. Their mission? Stop the evil space bug, Mizar, from his goal of galactic conquest with his seemingly-infinite army of Drones. They'll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and rescuing his subjects, the Tribals.&#xA;Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic creepy bugs explode into dribbly mucousy bits. The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful weapons, from the Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can charge up for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every shot, sending explosive doom in the direction of your target. There's also the Fish Food, which is used to...er, feed fish. Really.&#xA;Even though they're called Drones, these bugs aren't stupid. When encountered, they'll rush you, hide behind objects for cover, and even run off for reinforcements when you confront them. They also take delight in shooting the innocent Tribals, whom you are supposed to be rescuing. But the Drones are nothing compared to the game's insanely difficult bosses, which includes a pair of gigantic praying mantis, a huge beetle, and of course, Mizar himself, to name but a few.&#xA;Each of their team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, Vela can swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces. These abilities are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn't reach. The team also get the help of Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a floating gun with infinite ammo when he joins your team.&#xA;The game also includes three different multiplayer modes: Battle - featuring most options of an average First Person Shooter but with a third-person perspective, Target Shoot - a shooting gallery with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as old-school top down racing games.
John Romero's Daikatana (USA)>John Romero's Daikatana>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Kemco>Kotobuki System Co., Ltd.>Shooter>2.8>1-4 Players>You play Hiro Miyamoto an average martial arts instructor who gets involved in a mission of time-shattering proportions. You must rescue the girl from the evil corporation, find the sword with the girl, and travel back in time with the sword, the girl and a Superfly to get a vaccine for a virus that has wiped out two-thirds of the world's populace. The sword is the Daikatana, a weapon wielded by your ancestors, and you are... a guy with guns that fires at things a lot. This is a shooter, which means that while there are cutscenes and plotlines happening in the background, most of it is window dressing for miles of action and gallons of blood and flayed flesh.
Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest (USA)>Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Angel Studios>Baseball/Sports>3.9>1-4 Players>Aiming for further realism, Slugfest removes many arcade elements from the original Ken Griffey N64 title, replaced with more simulation style elements.&#xA;For the second time around, new inclusions feature updated team rosters and stats, a new behind the pitcher camera perspective, and a new create-a-player mode.&#xA;Full support is also included for 4 players in home run derby mode, and 2 player exhibition, while the expansion pak allows for higher resolutions for players and stadiums.

Kirby 64 - The Crystal Shards (USA)>Kirby 64 - The Crystal Shards>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>HAL Laboratory, Inc.>Platform>3.8>1-4 Players>Kirby's adventure for the Nintendo 64 is a polygonal side-scroller similar to Klonoa - however, unlike Klonoa, the game only follows one set path instead of multiple branching paths. In this game, Kirby can still copy the abilities of his foes - but in addition to this, he can combine these abilities with others to make unique combinations. (For one example, combining electricity and ice will turn Kirby into a fridge that spits out food.)&#xA;The story begins with Dark Matter assaulting a faraway land for their special crystal. A young fairy called Ribbon takes the crystal and escapes to save it. She lands in Dream Land, but pieces of the crystal have shattered and landed all across the world. Kirby volunteers to help and together they go to find all the missing pieces.&#xA;Kirby will encounter his friends, who have been controlled by Dark Matter. He'll have to battle them to rescue them. From there, they travel together to other different worlds, including Rock Star, Water Star, and Ripple Star, Ribbon's home world, where Dark Matter is lurking. To properly finish the game, players must find all the hidden crystal shards tucked away in the various levels. Only then will Kirby and his friends truly save Ripple Star.

Take out other airships and defense installations through areas from tunnels to martian like landscapes.&#xA;Unlike most shooters of this type, Knife Edge uses a unique camera perspective that automatically moves through the environment in front of you in order for quick target locks. And you don't control the ship itself, letting you concentrate on moving the target onto enemies ahead.&#xA;You can play the story mode by yourself or with 3 friends, each controlling a seperate ship for the battle ahead. A battle mode for 4 players is also included.

Legend of Zelda, The - Majora's Mask (USA)>Legend of Zelda, The - Majora's Mask>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Nintendo EAD>Adventure>4.6>1 Player>After ending the terror of evil in Hyrule, Link sets out to find another quest to complete, but on his way he stumbles into the wait of another evil force. Link awakens in a dazed and confused state, missing his Ocarina and his horse, and seems to be cursed. To make matters worse, Termina, the world that he has ended up in, is about to be destroyed by the Moon in less than three days, taking the rest of the world with it, including Hyrule. It is up to Link to save the day again.&#xA;Time travel and mask hunting take a bigger chunk out of the quest compared to the last Zelda. Although there are only three days to complete the game, the player is able to travel back in time after finding the Ocarina. Any items that were found and any quests that were completed are either saved or lost, depending on importance. Certain Masks turn Link into powerful characters, each with their own advantages (like the Zora Link, who can swim underwater for very long periods of time).&#xA;There are also plenty of sub-quests to complete and items to find, however the clock is always ticking away until the end of the world...
Legend of Zelda, The - Ocarina of Time (USA) (Rev B)>Legend of Zelda, The - Ocarina of Time>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Nintendo EAD>Adventure>4.2>1 Player>For the first time, The Legend of Zelda makes its way to the N64, in fine fashion. Our hero Link is once again called for to save the Kingdom of Hyrule, and this time he has a time travel device called the Ocarina to help him in his quest.&#xA;Ganon is once again up to his old tricks, and Princess Zelda, as well as the Great Deku Tree ask for Links help. To guide him, a young fairy called Navi shows him the tricks of the trade. You begin the adventure with the task of collecting your sword and shield, and then saving the Deku Tree from the evil that has attacked. From there, you travel to Hyrule, and the many worlds that stem from Hyrule Field.&#xA;There are many, many new things in this Zelda compared to past versions, including the use of time travel and the two different Links on each side (young Link, who you start the adventure with, and teen Link, who you must turn into to complete certain areas of the game). Weapons are also a key feature, with bombs, swords and other nifty gadgets available to help you in your quest.

The Federated Hegemonies have no choice but to ask the Lode Runners to stop the raids and put an end to the Emperor's rule.&#xA;Unable to use the full fleet on the Emperor's defenses, which would cause mass casualties, they decide that a lone Lod Runner should enter the enemy base to recover any gold found and destroy the Emperor.&#xA;From an isometric style perspective, you must guide Lode Runner through each of the levels, dodging defensive blocks and enemies by either placing bombs and blowing holes in the ground to finding another way around. By finding all of the gold on the level, you can then progress to the next level.
Mace - The Dark Age (USA)>Mace - The Dark Age>1997>ESRB - M (Mature)>Midway>Atari Games Corporation>Fighter>3.7>1-4 Players>Mace: The Dark age is a 3D fighting game set in a dark fantasy setting. Players can choose between 18 characters from all over the world equipped with swords, daggers, maces, katanas and other weapons. Basic moves include: a quick and a strong attack with weapons, kicks, sidesteps, and throws. Additional attacks can be performed by pressing the standard attack buttons in different positions or combined with directional buttons. Counter attacks are also possible, but require more complicated button combinations and good timing. Standard moves can be linked to combos and each character has a number of individual special moves that require specific button combinations to be used.&#xA;Battle arenas feature multiple levels and usually contain hazards like acid pools or swinging axes that deal damage when touched. Some arenas also contain interactive objects like plant pots or torches that can be thrown at opponents.&#xA;The game is fairly bloody (the gore can be turned off in the options menu) and all characters have their own finishing moves&#xA;(called executions) - particularly brutal ways of killing an opponent.
Madden Football 64 (USA)>Madden Football 64>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>EA Sports>Tiburon Entertainment>Football/Sports>3.7>1-4 Players>In terms of features, the first of Electronic Arts' Madden series to appear on the Nintendo 64 is closest to Madden Football '98.&#xA;Madden Football 64 was the most graphically advanced Madden game at the time of release. Visual features include 5000 frames of animation and a HelmetCam view from the player's eyes. AI adjusts during the game to your playing style. You can create, deaft and trade a full roster of players.&#xA;The game does not have an NFL license, so all the teams are named by just the city name with no logos. It does have a players license though, so all the real players are here.
Madden NFL 2000 (USA)>Madden NFL 2000>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>EA Sports>Tiburon Entertainment>Football/Sports>3.8>1-4 Players>John Madden brings the best football back to PC, bigger than ever!

Magical Tetris Challenge (USA)>Magical Tetris Challenge>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Puzzle>3.8>1-4 Players>Magical Tetris Challenge mixes the well known Tetris brand with the characters and worlds of Disney.

Mario Golf (USA)>Mario Golf>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Camelot Software Planning>Golf/Sports>3.6>1-4 Players>Since Mario rescued Princess Peach in Super Mario 64, he's been thoroughly enjoying his free time. Bowser hasn't been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn't allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become members, so they've come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64.&#xA;Mario Golf 64 features an all-star line up of 10 golfers from Nintendo's cast of video game celebrities, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. A highlight of Mario Golf 64 is a special "Time Attack Mode," where players must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible.&#xA;Mario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you'll have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional "Club Handicap Mode" ensures that you stay close to the competition, so Luigi won't get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are cartoons, the physics are as realistic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you may choose to place on the ball.
Mario Kart 64 (USA)>Mario Kart 64>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Nintendo EAD>Driving>3.9>1-4 Players>Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road.&#xA;The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.
Mario Party (USA)>Mario Party>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.>Party>3.8>1-4 Players>You know Mario can jump. You know he can kick Bowser's tail from here to the moon, but we bet you didn't realize that Mario is the biggest party animal on the face of the Earth. Nintendo is throwing the most insane bash to ever hit the N64, and you're invited. For the first time, you'll catch a glimpse of how Mario celebrates all of the victories he's had over the years.&#xA;Mario Party is unlike any other game for the N64, and it just might be the best party game to ever hit the system. Mario Party is designed for 1 to 4 players, but it's not really a party unless you're playing with your pals. The festivities are based on a board game format, right down to the fact that players must roll a die to determine how many spaces to move. The fun starts when players land on different squares, because each space holds one of more than fifty different mini-games. These quick competitions determine who will earn coins and stars, and who will go home empty handed.&#xA; The mini-games are spread over eight different game boards, all of which are not immediately available. Some of the games pit every man or princess against the others, some are two-on-two, and others are even three against one. The games are simple, but remarkably fun to play. One challenge is loosely based on "Simon Says," another involves a two-on-two bobsled race, and one crazy game makes one player attempt to cross a rope while the other three do their best to shake the player off. You'll find skill games, racing games, puzzle games --basically any type of challenge you could imagine.&#xA;A good portion of the actual game boards are animated, with hidden dangers and special challenges scattered everywhere. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Yoshi, and Wario are all invited to the party, and each character has his or her own game board.&#xA;Mario Party is fun for only one player, but to get the most out of this party-in-a-pak, you should play with three other friends. It's definitely the kind of game that will keep you up till the wee hours of the morning, so you might want to start catching up on your sleep right away.
Mario Party 2 (USA)>Mario Party 2>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.>Party>3.9>1-4 Players>Mario and a range of well known Nintendo characters, including Yoshi, Bowser, Luigi, and Wario return for some more party action.&#xA;The second edition includes 5 new boards, each with a specific theme, such as Space Land, Western Land, Horror Land, and Mystery Land. Each board includes unique attributes in relation to the theme, but the main goal is the same: complete the board game over a certain amount of moves and be the player to have the most coins and/or stars at the end.&#xA;The single player story mode allows one person and 3 CPU controlled players to play each board. Once you play a specific mini-game (64 in all), they become available to purchase using the coins you collected in your games to play anytime. Multiplayer allows 2 to 4 people to play the game.
Mario Party 3 (USA)>Mario Party 3>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.>Pinball>3.7>1-4 Players>The series continues with a set of 70 new mini-games. Play in the new single-player Story mode, or bring in some friends for Party mode. Four player games and a new two player mode are also available for play.&#xA;In Battle Royale mode (four player), you race around different boards to earn the most stars and coins. At the end of each round, you face it off in one of the mini-games, which can be chicken chases, snowball fights, or various other competitions.&#xA;Duel mode allows play between just two people. You still race around the board, but mini-games are only played when you land on a specific square. Another play change is the addition of another character for your team, allowing tag team-style action in the game.&#xA;Story mode is essentially the same as a Battle Royale, except your opponents are played by the computer.
Mario Tennis (USA)>Mario Tennis>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Camelot Software Planning>Sports/Tennis>3.7>1-4 Players>Choose your favourite Nintendo character and take to the world of tennis. Game types include ring shot (where you must shoot the ball through golden hoops that are suspended above the play area, gaining bonus points as you play), bomb tennis (simply put Tennis with Bombs) and Piranha Challenge (much like the tennis machines which chuck balls at you, but in this case they are replaced with Piranha plants). Of course, there is your normal tournament mode, with up to 4 players in on the action, and some crazy arenas, especially Bowser's Castle, which is suspended above a lava pit!
Mega Man 64 (USA)>Mega Man 64>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Adventure>2.8>1 Player>In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide huge treasures. And where there's treasure, you can find treasure hunters called Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt...&#xA;Barrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan.&#xA;While out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel's airship, the Flutter, crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look for the treasure, but at the same time, they're going to get a little competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes...&#xA;Mega Man Legends is the first of the Mega Man series to take place in fully explorable 3D, and is paced more like an RPG than the previous stage-to-stage action games. Rock can explore the town and follow the story to find entrances to the underground ruins, where in he will find traps, feral Reaverbots, and large boss robots. Destroying enemies will reward Rock with health, sub-weapon energy, and the power cores of the robots, which people in his world use as currency. By searching through the town and ruins Rock will find items of dubious use and value, and they can be brought back to Roll to be assembled into useful items and upgradable sub-weapons, although not for free. Rock can run while shooting, go into first person mode for aimed shots, and also lock onto an enemy and circle around them to avoid their attacks.
Mia Hamm Soccer 64 (USA) (En,Es)>Mia Hamm Soccer 64>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SouthPeak Games>DC Studios, Inc.>Soccer/Sports>3.0>1-4 Players>Michael Owen's WLS 2000: World League Soccer is a soccer game for the Nintendo 64. In the game you can choose to play one of over 200 teams from various countries in custom cups.&#xA;The game features two modes of control: easy and professional. The latter allows you to perform a wide array of over 23 different special moves and maneuvers. Controls allow you to shoot, pass and sprint. Unlike other soccer games you cannot choose which player you want to control when on the defense, the decision is made for you.&#xA;The later released US version of the game, named Mia Hamm Soccer 64, had all the player models replaced with female versions and all team names changed.
Mickey's Speedway USA (USA)>Mickey's Speedway USA>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Rareware>Driving>3.9>1-4 Players>The Weasels have kidnapped Pluto while he was wearing his diamond collar! All that was left of him was a ransom note showing the Weasels driving him away in a van. Mickey rounds up all of his friends (and even Pete wants to get in on the action!), and Professor Von Drake soups up their race cars so that they can catch up with the Weasels as they go on a cross-country tour of the United States. The Weasels have also stolen four parts of the Professor's top-secret racer, and hidden them in four of the tracks. Once players find all these pieces, they can catch up with the Weasels in the final showdown.&#xA;Mickey's Speedway USA is a kart racer from Rare based on the Diddy Kong Racing game engine. Players compete in circuits of four races, grand prix style, and the player with the most points at the end of all four races wins the gold trophy. There are six initial racers, but only three sets of stats shared between them. Minnie and Daisy are lightweight and good for beginners, Mickey and Donald are both all-around characters, while Pete and Goofy are the slow but fast heavyweights.&#xA;The game has an assortment of pickups - there's the Carbo Spritzer, a soda-powered turbo; the Paint Splotcher, which launches a slippery blob of paint onto the track; the Baseball Chucker, which launches an explosive baseball onto the track; and the Magno Flyer, which sends a remote control plane to seek the nearest opponent, to name a few. There are also 'Oomph Tokens' scattered on the track - the first ten of these tokens increase your racer's maximum speed a little.&#xA;As well as the main game, Mickey's Speedway USA also features a Time Trial mode (where you race against the clock), a Practice mode (where you can drive all around a farmyard course to practice your skills), and Contest mode (which functions like the famous Battle Mode in Mario Kart 64 - players must pop their opponents' three balloons before they lose all of their own). The game is also Transfer Pak compatible with the Game Boy Color version of Mickey's Speedway USA.

Mortal Kombat Mythologies - Sub-Zero (USA)>Mortal Kombat Mythologies - Sub-Zero>1997>ESRB - M (Mature)>Midway>Avalanche Software LLC>Platform>2.8>1 Player>In a surprising twist of fate, Midway made a Mortal Kombat game that focuses on perhaps the series strongest point when compared to other fighting games: it's storyline. The game casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that ocurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1.&#xA;In a storyline that is reminiscent of Looking Glass's Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4's Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power. However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him.&#xA;Gameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting enviroment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero's interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a &quot;use&quot; and &quot;turn around&quot; buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight rpg twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.&#xA;Technically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK's series 2D engines. New features include zooming, 3d lighting as well as 3d backgrounds and characters, etc.

NHL 99 (USA)>NHL 99>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>EA Sports>Electronic Arts Canada>Hockey/Sports>3.6>1-4 Players>After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.&#xA;Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.&#xA;As graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jagr, Fedorov and SelÃ¤nne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a "Brett Hull". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.&#xA;The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.&#xA;Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.

Nightmare Creatures (USA)>Nightmare Creatures>1998>ESRB - M (Mature)>Activision>Kalisto Entertainment SA>Adventure>4.1>1 Player>Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim's bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous brutes.

Now, as either his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley.&#xA;Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat.

There are also numerous other vehicles that you come to be able to use, including tanks and jet fighters. Do all you can to defeat LeMonde and remove him from Southeast Asia!
Off Road Challenge (USA)>Off Road Challenge>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Midway>Avalanche Software LLC>Driving>2.7>1-4 Players>Off Road Challenge is an off-road truck racing game for the Nintendo 64. Like Cruis'n USA, it was also an arcade game ported over to the N64. Gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, Super Off Road: The Baja. The player races against other off-road vehicles across various landscapes, while collecting nitros and gold along the way. Gold picked up on the course or earned from racing can be used to upgrade the vehicle. Once the player has completed the circuit, they move up to the next difficulty level and go through it again, keeping the upgraded truck.

The kingdoms lord, Holy Lodis Empire, is rumored to be planning the domination of the entire continent of Zeteginia. This creates concern among the people, and it is up to Magnus to rid the Lord from the kingdom, to free the people from slavoury forever.&#xA;A semi-sequel to the original Ogre Battle which came out on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and the third in the series, you don't actually control where the characters go, but you do control their actions and fighting techniques (much like Age of Empires and similar war-based titles). The main characters, Magnus, leads many troops into each battle, and you must control how each group attacks or defends, and if you wish to use straight forward attacks or magic.&#xA;Depending on what you achieve, there are branching levels (much like Starfox 64), each with their own difficulty levels. The more battles you face and complete, the experience of each warrior in your team increases, so when you reach the latter levels, your team will last much longer against stronger opponants.

Paper Mario (USA)>Paper Mario>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd.>Role-Playing>3.9>1 Player>Up in Star Haven, there exists a Star Wand that allows the stars to grant wishes to those who are pure of heart. The Star Wand is looked over by the Seven Star Spirits, who protect it in its sanctuary. However, Bowser attacks Star Haven, steals the Star Wand, and locks up the Star Spirits so that they cannot challenge his power. With his new powers, Bowser defeats Mario and lifts Princess Peach's castle into the air, taking her and all her guests as prisoners. Now, the only way to challenge Bowser's unbridled power is to rescue all seven Star Spirits, which have been imprisoned all over the land.&#xA;Paper Mario is the follow-up to Super Mario RPG: Legend Of The Seven Stars for Super Nintendo. Basically, this is an RPG set in the Mario universe. Mario has the ability to gain experience and grow levels by defeating enemies and bosses. Mario also has the ability to recruit teammates to help him out in battle. As well, Mario can collect badges that will help his combat abilities, star pieces that he can trade for badges, and more items that he can use throughout the game. The Star Spirits will also aid him in his quest.&#xA;Like Super Mario RPG before it, Paper Mario's graphics are very unique to any other game. All the characters are 2D within a fully 3D world. This gives the feeling that each character is made out of "paper".
Paperboy (USA)>Paperboy>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Midway>High Voltage Software, Inc.>Action>2.6>1 Player>Paperboy returns with a new retro-3D look, but with the same objectives.

For each street, you have a maximum of subscribers that you need to sign-up before you can move onto the next, and more challenging street (aka, the next level). Each street also includes objects that will get in your way (such as dogs, fire hydrants, etc.) as well as bonus objectives (collecting three coins by knocking down people and items on the street will take you to the bonus levels, ranging from obstacle courses to catching fire flies. You can win extra subscribers by completing the bonus levels).
Penny Racers (USA)>Penny Racers>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>THQ>Locomotive>Driving>4.0>1-4 Players>Penny Racers is a racing game with cartoonish, made-of-paper-like cars. There are thirteen cars which you can choose from and nine tracks in total - all available right from the start. It features two playable modes, Race Series and Time Trial, and a mode that allows you to create your own track. The game also supports up to four human players.&#xA;In Race Series you can select one of the thirteen cars and race in any of the nine tracks with five more competitors. You can only compete in Class C (lower difficulty) races at first but can unlock more if you finish within the first three positions. At the beginning of each race you are given the option to customize your car's parts - parts like the car's body, engine, tires, etc. - but only if you have more than one in stock for each category. New parts can be taken from the other cars at the end of each race but only if you are among the first three racers that cross the finish line. Also, each part has points and the sum of these points must not exceed the point limit for each difficulty. For example a basic brake part may add one point to the total sum (better parts add more points). If with all the other parts the sum of points exceeds a lets say point limit of six then you are not allowed to enter the race. The current mode supports up to two human players.&#xA;Time Trial is the basic mode where you run against time. You can also load a previously saved ghost to race against.&#xA;VS Race mode can be accessed only if three or four human players are selected. It has 8 tracks that are different from the ones of the other modes and these tracks have more obstacles.&#xA;New Track lets you create your own custom made track. You can select the road type (on road/off road) and track type (circuit/stage). After the basic layout is selected you are taken on the "map" where you can choose from the available layers to make the track. You can also adjust the road's height.
Perfect Dark (USA) (Rev A)>Perfect Dark>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Nintendo>Rare, Ltd.>Shooter>4.7>1-4 Players>Joanna Dark is an agent for the Carrington Institute, a secret organization funded by anonymous sources and dedicated to protecting the world. Through their highly trained operatives and special devices (gadgets), Carrington keeps an eye on terrorists, world powers, and strange happenings. The speed in which the dataDyne corporation has established itself through the development of new technologies is starting to worry the institute. So when Carrington receives a message from Dr. Caroll, a scientist wishing to escape dataDyne, they send their best agent, Joanna, to infiltrate the company headquarters...&#xA;Perfect Dark is a first person game similar to Rare's earlier Goldeneye: 007 though with more of an emphasis on stealth. Joanna can pick up and use a variety of firearms. In addition she carries quite a few spy gadgets such as IR scanners, night vision, probes, and a deadly laptop.&#xA;The Xbox 360 port has redone graphics to support a 1080p full HD resolution at 60 frames per second. It also incorporates full multiplayer support over Xbox LIVE.
PGA European Tour (USA)>PGA European Tour>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Infogrames>Infogrames Studios Ltd.>Golf/Sports>3.2>1-4 Players>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.&#xA;The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.&#xA;As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.
Pilotwings 64 (USA)>Pilotwings 64>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Paradigm Entertainment Inc.>Simulation>4.1>1 Player>PilotWings 64 is the update to the original PilotWings for SNES.

True PokÃ©mon Puzzle Masters will discover many ways to play the game, but the basic idea is to destroy puzzle pieces by matching up three or more blocks of the same color.&#xA;The more puzzle pieces you eliminate at the same time, the more points you'll score. If you're battling another Trainer, you can send powerful attacks to their puzzle board by completing big Combos and Skill Chains. If you can't clear your stack of puzzle pieces before they reach the top of the screen, you're doomed.&#xA;You'll discover many challenges as you travel through Puzzle League Village, from the exciting 3D Puzzle Mode to the brain-bruising exercises at PokÃ©mon Puzzle University.

Pokemon Snap (USA)>Pokemon Snap>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>HAL Laboratory, Inc.,>Action>3.5>1 Player>As Todd Snap, an aspiring PokÃ©mon photographer, you must travel through different environment types in order to photograph as many PokÃ©mon as you can find. With the help of Professor Oak, you will discover new places to photograph PokÃ©mon, ranging from those such as a volcano which houses Fire PokÃ©mon to a jungle housing Grass PokÃ©mon. The game features 63 of the original 151 PokÃ©mon, including favorites such as Pikachu and Charizard.&#xA;Throughout your journey as a PokÃ©mon photographer you will obtain new items from Professor Oak to help snap a photo of those PokÃ©mon whose attention you just can't seem to attract. At first you are equipped with only an apple, but by taking great photos of various species you will get access to items such as a Pester Ball or a PokÃ© Flute. Gameplay is similar to that of a rail-shooter, in which you move across a linear route and are only able to look around to take pictures. At the end of each route you receive a score from Oak depending on things such as the position of the PokÃ©mon in the frame shot, the size of the PokÃ©mon in the picture, or how many of that PokÃ©mon are together in the shot. Up to 60 photos can be taken during each course and you choose the one to submit to Oak. All the photos you take can later be accessed in your own PokÃ©mon album. The game features six different courses, but a seventh one can be unlocked by taking a picture of a mysterious PokÃ©mon sign in each of the other courses. The seventh course known as Rainbow Cloud offers the only opportunity to snap a photo of the rare and elusive psychic PokÃ©mon, Mew.

Along the way, you will get the chance to fight for a range of Poke-cups, or take your Pokemon for a ride to a collection of mini-games for bonus prizes (or just for the fun of it).&#xA;4 players can compete in the one tournament, while the transfer pak allows you to upload your Pokemon that you have from the range of Pokemon Game Boy Games (including the original Pokemon Red and Blue, and the GBC Gold/Silver series). If you don't have the Game Boy games, you can choose from a selection of Pokemon straight out of the box to get into the fight without mucking around.
Polaris SnoCross (USA)>Polaris SnoCross>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Vatical Entertainment>Vicarious Visions, Inc.>Water>2.4>1-4 Players>As the title implies, Polaris SnoCross is a game based on the sport of snowmobile racing.

Quake 64 (USA)>Quake 64>1998>ESRB - M (Mature)>Midway>Midway Games, Inc.>Shooter>3.7>1-2 Players>An enemy with the codename "Quake", which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.&#xA;id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.&#xA;In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.&#xA;Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.&#xA;The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel. Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.&#xA;Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.
Quake II (USA)>Quake II>1999>ESRB - M (Mature)>Activision>Raster Productions L.L.C.>Shooter>3.1>1-4 Players>A sequel in name only, this follow up to id's 1996 Quake, is a first-person shooter revolving around the Earth-Strogg war. The Strogg alien race threatens the Earth, but Earth has launched a counter-offensive, Operation Alien Overlord. Overlord takes the battle to the Strogg homeworld with the ultimate objective of securing their capitol city and killing their ruler.&#xA;As a FPS, Quake II contains a variety of weapons including the fall back Blaster, the Railgun, and the secret BFG10K. Health, armor, and ammunition pick-ups can be found during levels, as can the classic Quake's Quad Damage power-up. Game play involves mowing down alien opponents as the player progresses through levels, completing in-game objectives. Quake II also comes with multiplayer support for Deathmatches.

Rakuga Kids (Europe)>Rakuga Kids>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Konami>Konami Computer Entertainment Kobe, Inc.>Fighter>4.2>1-2 Players>It was school holidays, and the Twinkle gang of schoolkids sailed to an island where they found a cave with crayons hidden inside. They split them among the group, but before they had finished, a bully came and stole the pack along with the last two crayons! He drew a mischievous-looking character, who came to life and said "Let's cause trouble!" Twinkle Town was terrified of the bully and his crayon character, so the Twinkle gang decided to draw their own superheroes to stop the bully!&#xA;Rakugakids is a 2D fighting game, similar to Marvel Vs. Capcom. You select from a variety of hand-drawn cartoon characters, and fight using low, middle and high punches and kicks. As you'd expect with this type of game, special button combinations yield special, more powerful moves. There is also a 'crayon meter' that fills the more you attack your opponent - when it is completely filled, you can pull off a devastating special move.&#xA;The kids' characters are a lively bunch, full of an assortment of crazy moves. There's Robot C.H.O., who is a robot that turns into different metal objects on the fly, such as a car, garbage can, rocket, and more. There's BearTank, which is a green teddy bear with gun turrets on it. Captain.Cat.Kit is a DJ cat with slick basketball moves who also attacks with a variety of musical instruments.&#xA;An interesting feature of Rakugakids is that Story Mode can be played by using "Training Mode". In this mode, you select a character, and train them up by playing matches against any character you like. It is beneficial to train more, because you can choose to play Story Mode in 'Battle Mode'. This mode automatically plays the game for you using your trained up character. If you've trained enough, your character will react to opponent attacks in the same way that you yourself would.

It is also possible to customize certain options like tires, steering, etc., to get the best possible performance depending on the weather condition on each course.&#xA;3. Practice - mode where you can learn the controls and get acquainted with the various courses of the game.&#xA;4. Vs Race - allows up to 4 players to play simultaneously in any of the game's courses.
Rampage - World Tour (USA)>Rampage - World Tour>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>Midway>Game Refuge Inc.>Action>3.1>1-3 Players>Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage. Rampage World Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George, Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste. George has turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some sort of gigantic wolf. The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe.&#xA;The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on tanks. The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by traveling to the cities where they are located. Being creatures of such massive size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way. Scumlabs and the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another player that can play simultaneously.&#xA;The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful "cartoon" flavor. Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and eating their inhabitants to destroy them. Once all the buildings for a particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to the next stage. Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them more powerful or restore health.
Rampage 2 - Universal Tour (USA)>Rampage 2 - Universal Tour>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Midway>Avalanche Software LLC>Action>3.0>1-3 Players>While technology may improve graphics and sound, some things never change. Rampage 2: Universal Tour is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.

Re-Volt (USA)>Re-Volt>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim>Acclaim Studios London>Driving>3.1>1-4 Players>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live!&#xA;Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from.&#xA;There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places.&#xA;In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.

He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield. His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out. The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features. Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling. This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.&#xA;Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web. By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things. There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.&#xA;Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.&#xA;There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.

In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep.&#xA;Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.&#xA;Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.

WWF War Zone (USA)>WWF War Zone>1998>ESRB - T (Teen)>Acclaim>Iguana West>Sports/Wrestling>3.2>1-4 Players>One of the first wrestling games for the Nintendo 64, and one of the many for the Playstation. The Playstation version has better, CD quality music, but has less features. One of the main attractions was that WWF's Steve Austin did a lot of voice acting for it, although the other wrestlers don't have nearly as much speech.&#xA;Features include custom player made wrestlers, as well as the real wrestlers, many different game types (single player, multiplayer, royal rumbles, cage matches, etc.), but the career mode is where the action is, and you can build up your wrestlers strengths, and earn him belts.

Xena - Warrior Princess - The Talisman of Fate (USA)>Xena - Warrior Princess - The Talisman of Fate>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Titus Software>Saffire Corporation>Fighter>3.5>1-4 Players>Xena: Warrior Princess - Talisman of Fate is based on the TV-series Xena: Warrior Princess. The Nintendo 64 version of the series tie-in is a fighting game, unlike its PlayStation counterpart.&#xA;The whole Xena universe is used in the game as all the levels and characters, except the new boss character, are familiar to the fans of the show. The action takes place in arenas which represent different kinds of surroundings with all the characters having their "own" level.&#xA;The fighting is done with various weapons each character wielding his/her trademark weapon such as Xena's chakram, Gabrielle's staff and Callisto's sword. It includes most of the standard fighting-game modes such as story, vs. and training as well as a roster mode, where each player picks a succession of characters rather than just one.&#xA;The fighting system is somewhat different from more traditional games. The most obvious difference is that four players are allowed instead of two. It can be a team battle or a free-for-all. The analog stick moves characters around on the ground in two dimensions, with separate buttons for block, jump and duck. The C-buttons handle attacks. Special moves are accomplished mostly by pulling the analog stick either toward your opponent, then away or vice-versa.
Yoshi's Story (USA) (En,Ja)>Yoshi's Story>1998>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Nintendo>Nintendo Co., Ltd.>Platform>3.4>1 Player>Loosely based on the Super NES classic Yoshi's Island, Yoshi's Story follows the adventures of six Yoshis as they search through sunny woods, dark caves, soaring mountains, steaming jungles, vast oceans, and gloomy castles for the Super Happy Tree, which has been stolen by the dreaded Baby Bowser. Yoshi can walk, run, swim, leap, flutter, and fire his payload of eggs. The action takes place in storybook "pages" made up of bookmaking materials and other familiar textures, including cut-paper forests, denim clouds, inflatable plastic islands, and stacks of colored spools.&#xA;Yoshi's Story pioneers use of the Rumble Pak as a key element of the game-play experience, as you'll be able to feel invisible but treacherous currents when Yoshi swims through oceanic depths. The Rumble Pak can also help you locate hidden fruit or other objects by rumbling when Yoshi smells something. With a light touch of the Control Stick you can float on a leaf, ride a friendly dragon, and tiptoe past a swarm of angry bees.
