You control a little character whose main attack comes from his disembodied head. Yes, years before Rayman appeared, we already had a hero who used detachable appendages to attack his enemies.&#xA;Rather than the traditional power-ups, Dynamite Headdy enables you to swap your head for different kinds - such as heads that heal you or heads that stick on to walls. You use your head in order to climb up on platforms as well, as you can grab hold of things with it, and on certain stages of the Mega Drive/Genesis version it is used to turn the game into a side-scrolling shooter, as you gain a propeller, jet, or bird head. Basically, Dynamite Headdy is just a traditional platformer at heart.

Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, the developers went for a more strategic sim. Differently from its Genesis counterpart, the game is played from a first or third person point of view, with the fighters facing each other directly. The player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view ("through his eyes").&#xA;Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.&#xA;The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).

The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.

It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.&#xA;There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims.

The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29 stages. The player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve). Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen. Some enemies arrive in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen. Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies. Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.

Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing both weapons at once.

Head Buster (Japan) (Translated En)>Head Buster>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Masaya>NCS Corporation|Winds Co., Ltd.>Strategy>2.9>1-2 Players>Head Buster is a so-called "future sports" game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, albeit without many of the refinements of that series.&#xA;Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.&#xA;Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.

Or not, as this is a standard platform game with a twist of questionable taste and purpose.&#xA;You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over.

It does feature sports-related questions as the main bulk of the game where the player answers questions in three rounds using the D-Pad to spell out answers. However, it does not feature digitized contestants, studio or the host Alex Trebek, though it does feature a photo likeness of him for intros. Instead it features a more cartoonish look without sports-themed contestants and less questions than the console versions. It does feature a two-player option utilizing the link cable allowing friends to compete head-to-head, but only allows the player to compete against one computer opponent as opposed to two as in other versions.

Compared to the Genesis version released a year earlier, the Game Gear version features only about half the number of questions, and replaces the console version's photo-realistic style with a more cartoon-like approach. Unlike in the actual TV show, there always only two contestants. Players can choose their avatar from six different characters. The game supports one or two players: in a two-player game, both share the same Game Gear and must buzz in by using either the d-pad or the face buttons. Once buzzed in, the question must be spelled out within 60 seconds, with the game allowing for some spelling variations and minor misspellings. Game rules are accurate to the original show and include Daily Doubles and the Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy rounds.

He was voted by the Associated Press as the most valuable player two years running (1989-90). In Joe Montana Football the player can play a game of American Football with Joe Montana giving the player basic tips on the next best move. The player can play against a friend or play the computer with 3 difficulty levels (beginner, normal, and professional) in a full game (5 min per quarter) using all the real rules and scoring. The teams are made up of 28 American city names with no team names (or player names) mentioned. Once the coin is flipped and the kick-off the game begins. The player controls the on-screen player as they try to run up the field. Once the player is downed the game turns to a play selection screen where the player can choose their next play (tactic) out of the 17 different preset plays available, as well as a punt, attempt at a field goal, or a turnover, all done in full view of the opponent (the CPU will change their play to match yours). More often then not Joe himself will give a tip on the best play that it will default to. On the field the player controlling the quarterback can throw it to the receiver (changing the player control to the receiver), change the receiver to pass to, or try to run with the quarterback. When play changes hands and the player becomes a defender the player has 6 defensive plays to choose from as well as a turnover. On the field the player controls a single player chosen by cycling though the players or selecting the player closest to the selected receiver. Two player mode works the same as single player but with a player instead of the computer.

Kinetic Connection (Japan)>Kinetic Connection>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Puzzle>2.5>1 Player>The Game Gear version of Kinetic Connection has been rearranged a lot from the original version released 5 years earlier to cope with a smaller screen and Sega's taste in motifs.&#xA;As the original version, Kinetic Connection is a jigsaw puzzle game, where the pieces are animated. This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.&#xA;The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:&#xA;Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the player slide entire rows and columns around in the puzzle. The two second modes call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.&#xA;You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.
Lemmings 2 - The Tribes (Europe) (Proto)>Lemmings 2 - The Tribes>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Psygnosis>DMA Design>Puzzle>4.2>1 Player>The sequel to Lemmings has a plot describing how the Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces. Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment. Unlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. Because there are 12 tribes, and the player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie.&#xA;As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your &quot;roar meter&quot; to charge.&#xA;As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen).&#xA;The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.
Lost World, The - Jurassic Park (USA)>Lost World, The - Jurassic Park>1997>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Aspect Co., Ltd.>Action>4>1 Player>The Game Gear received a unique adaptation of the 1997 dinosaur sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park. It is primarily a side-scrolling platform game but also includes some other gameplay elements. Players control a hunter who, armed with a stun rifle and having enlisted the the help of a friendly Procompsognathus ("Compy"), must make his way through various levels on Isla Sorna to finally reach a helicopter and escape. The next level to be played can be chosen on an overview map of the island, allowing for some freedom regarding level order. In the standard platform levels, the goal is simply to reach the exit. Various dinosaurs must be avoided or taken out with the gun and environmental dangers like sand pits, rock avalanches and water holes must also be mastered. The gun's ammunition is unlimited and the hunter can take several hits before losing a life - his health is indicated by the color of his shirt. Replacement body armor is available as a power-up. In one of the levels, players don't control the hunter but Compy instead. Compy can only take one hit before losing a life, and instead of a gun, he has a jump attack. He also has the ability to climb walls. After most platform levels, a boss fight against an especially large and/or dangerous dinosaur follows, each attacking in a certain pattern requiring its own strategy to defeat. Variety from the standard platforming comes in a level where a raging Triceratops attacks from the left and the hunter must run for his life through the automatically-scrolling landscape. The final escape from the island takes place in a car, seen from the front (i.e. driving towards the screen), with a T. Rex attacking from behind. Both the dinosaur's attacks as well as obstacles on the road (like boulders and water puddles) must be avoided to reach the goal.

Micro Machines (Europe)>Micro Machines>1993>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Codemasters Software Company>Codemasters Software Company>Driving>3.8>1-2 Players>If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.&#xA;These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.&#xA;Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.&#xA;The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4 points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level, although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.&#xA;Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.&#xA;The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:&#xA;1. &quot;Hot Spots&quot; are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.&#xA;Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when picked up.

NFL Quarterback Club (World)>NFL Quarterback Club>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Condor, Inc.>Sports/Football>3.1>1 Player>Quarterback Club for the Game Gear is a take of Acclaim's other 16-bit versions, with the same amount of teams, 28 in all, and has preseason, playoffs and a season mode as well, but is missing the simulation mode, QB challenge and the "Build you own" QB mode that the console versions feature. It also has only 20 different running and passing plays per team.

NHL Hockey (USA, Europe)>NHL Hockey>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Park Place Productions>Sports/Hockey>2.7>1 Player>NHL Hockey was EA Sports' third licensed ice hockey game, promising the fastest action in the series to date. The action is viewed top-down, and can be played with or without realistic penalties.

You have full control over trading and creating players for your squad. New in-game moves include dummy shots and lie-down blocks.
Ninja Gaiden (USA, Europe)>Ninja Gaiden>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Tecmo, Ltd.>Platform>4>1 Player>Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which 2 ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.&#xA;Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.&#xA;Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.
Olympic Gold (USA)>Olympic Gold>1992>ESRB - E (Everyone)>U.S. Gold Ltd.>Tiertex Ltd.>Sports/Olympic>1.9>1-4 Players>The official game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992, featuring seven different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, Archery, 110M Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.&#xA;Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the 80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.&#xA;Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being the one with the highest score on all three rounds.&#xA;The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).
Ottifants, The (Europe)>Ottifants, The>1993>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Graftgold Ltd.>Platform>4.5>1 Player>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad!&#xA;The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.&#xA;Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.
OutRun (USA, Europe)>Out Run>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Tec Toy Ind˙stria de Brinquedos S.A.>SEGA-AM2 Co., LTD.>Driving>3.8>1-2 Players>Race across varied terrain in this conversion of one of the most famous arcade racing games. Your Ferrari is at the ready, complete with female passenger, over a series of short tracks.&#xA;Gameplay is viewed form just above and behind the car, so you can see it. The roads are full of sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can cause the car to roll and lose you time. On each section of track there is a fork in the road, allowing you to choose which direction you go in. You have to complete 5 track sections in total, out of the 15 in the game.
OutRun Europa (USA, Europe)>Out Run Europa>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>U.S. Gold Ltd.>Probe Software Ltd.>Driving>3.8>1 Player>The third game in the OutRun series, which revolutionised the third-person perspective style of racing games. The levels are set across Europe, as you bid to escape from the police. Unlike in the predecessors, you use a different vehicle on each level, with motorbikes and jet-skis adding variety and taking different skill to use. You must complete each level within the strict time limits, and the roads are dogged with other cars to avoid and overtake. You can choose between sound effects or music.
Pac-Attack (USA, Europe)>Pac-Attack>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Namco Hometek Inc.>Namco Limited>Puzzle>3.2>1-2 Players>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.&#xA;The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.&#xA;Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.&#xA;The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.&#xA;All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.
Pac-In-Time (USA) (Proto)>Pac-In-Time>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Namco Limited>Kalisto>Platform>3>1 Player>Everybody knows what/who Pac-Man is from his heyday in the '80s, but this time, we're getting a whole new adventure of our little eater. Guess his stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero's Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford. Pac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek/Super Skweek/Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.
Pac-Man (USA)>Pac-Man>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Namco Limited>Namco Limited>Action>3.4>1-2 Players>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.&#xA;Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.&#xA;Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.&#xA;Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.
Panzer Dragoon Mini (Japan)>Panzer Dragoon Mini>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Shooter>3>1 Player>Panzer Dragoon Mini is the Japan-only 8-bit version of Sega's popular 32-bit rail shooter, but due to (massive) hardware limitations, the game has more in common with other classic Sega game, Space Harrier. Taking further away from the original games, there is no rider and the game lacks any plotline.&#xA;The player starts by choosing one of three dragons, and from there must shoot at incoming enemies (although for most time, just avoiding incoming fire is an easier way to progress in the game). At the end of the level (each with two bosses), a password appears and allows the game to be resumed later.
Paperboy (USA, Europe)>Paperboy>1992>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Tengen Inc.>Atari, Inc.>Driving>3>1 Player>Based on the arcade game, the object of Paperboy is to deliver papers to your customers while inflicting as much damage as possible to the houses of your non-customers. To make things more difficult, numerous obstacles get in your way including construction workers, rogue tires, skateboarders, dogs and cats, cars, and even the occasional tornado.
Paperboy II (USA, Europe)>Paperboy II>1992>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Tengen Inc.>Atari Games Corporation>Action>1.8>1 Player>You're a paper boy. Get on your bicycle.

Pete Sampras Tennis (Europe)>Pete Sampras Tennis>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Codemasters Software Company>Codemasters Software Company>Sports/Tennis>3>1-4 Players>Play singles and doubles exhibiting games, knockout tournaments or go on a world tour, it's all here in this tennis sim. You can choose to play as the (then) world seed 1, Pete Sampras himself or from 29 other players.&#xA;The actions is viewed from the traditional third-person viewpoint. A tutorial mode is provided to help you get used to the forehand, lob and drop shots on offer. Several venues from all over the world can be played on, on Hard, Grass and Clay courts.&#xA;This was the first and one of the very few Genesis games to be released with a J-Cart, which meant that four-way gameplay was possible without the need of special adapters - the cartridge had two built-in joypad connectors. The Game Gear version was equally inventive, allowing two players to share one Game Gear, or four players to play doubles by linking two machines.
PGA Tour 96 (USA, Europe)>PGA Tour 96>1996>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Black Pearl Software>Ceris Software>Sports/Golf>4>1-4 Players>The Game Gear version of PGA Tour 96 is the last entry in the series on the platform. It has a different selection of courses, licensed PGA golfers and modes compared to other versions. The three available courses are Sawgrass, Summerlin and River High. The five game modes are Practice, Putting, Driving, Skins and Tournament. Up to four players taking turns on the same Game Gear are supported. The gameplay is similar to many other games of the genre: the player is shown an overhead view of the map and then taken to a perspective directly behind the golfer. Using the D-pad to move a cursor on screen to aim their shot and pressing a main button to activate the power/accuracy meter below, pressing once to set the power and again for accuracy.
PGA Tour Golf (USA)>PGA Tour Golf>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Tengen Inc.>Sterling Silver Software>Golf/Sports>2.2>1-4 Players>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing.&#xA;Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.&#xA;When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.
PGA Tour Golf II (USA, Europe)>PGA Tour Golf II>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Time Warner Interactive, Inc.>Polygames>Sports/Golf>1.8>1-4 Players>A follow-up to PGA Tour Golf and a reduced version of it's Genesis counterpart where the player can choose play as a generic pro golfer or as an amateur and compete against four real-life pros including Fred Couples, Paul Azinger, Craig Stadler & Fuzzy Zoeller with six different locations to choose from. Players can choose to either play in Tournament mode, Skins Play or learn the basics of the game in Practice mode.&#xA;Players use a cursor on a top-down view of a map to determine the location as well as another view from behind the golfer to avoid various obstacles such as trees. After selecting their location they can then use a meter to the bottom left to determine how much draw or fade will be put into the shot. To hit the ball, the players presses the "B" button to start the power meter and hitting it again to stop.&#xA;Players must also adjust to changing wind and weather conditions during game play which will drastically change the outcome of their shot. It features four-player capabilities using Gear-to-Gear links as well as a password feature.

One day, in December 1268 A.W, you received a letter at base. The sender was Ken Miller. He was a scientist as well as an old friend of yours.

You must come and see it.&#xA;You travel to the planet Dezolis and visit a town called Carsonville. There, you find out that Dr. Miller has invented a machine that can make human beings immensely powerful. The problem is, Dr. Miller is kidnapped, along with his invention. With the help of his sister Laila you have to solve this mystery.&#xA;This game is a Japanese-style adventure game set in the Phantasy Star universe. You interact with the game world by choosing available options such as "See", "Talk", "Move", etc. There are a few puzzles to solve, but the largest part of the game is dedicated to exploration and dialogue with the characters.
Phantasy Star Gaiden (Japan) (Translated En)>Phantasy Star Gaiden>1992>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Japan System Supply>Role-Playing>3.2>1 Player>Long ago, the evil Cablon ravaged the Copto planet, a light year away of the Algol system. When he was defeated, he was sealed on a planet discovered by Alis, the heroine of the first "Phantasy Star", a planet that was also known as Alisland. In this gaiden (side-story) set in Phantasy Star universe, you play the role of two young people from the village Tedo - Alec and Mina. One day, Mina finds an old artifact. While wondering what that could be, the young people learn that Alec' father was attacked and kidnapped by bandits. Determined to find him, the two heroes embark on a dangerous journey that will eventually lead them much further than they suspect.&#xA;Phantasy Star Gaiden plays pretty much like any other Phantasy Star starting with the second game: both towns and dungeons are in top-down view, the turn-based battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay is standard console-style RPG: you should fight random enemies, gain experience and gold, buy better equipment, visit many towns and dungeons, etc.

Pop Breaker (Japan)>Pop Breaker>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Micro Cabin Corp.>Micro Cabin Corp.>Shooter>3.5>1-2 Players>Pop Breaker is a puzzle game with action elements. The goal of each level is to destroy certain things. The basic way to do this is to shoot them, but there are various obstacles which need to be circumvented, e.g. mirrors which reflect shots; the direction is indicated by small arrows on the floor. Destructible blocks are distinguished by their colour, for example a purple block becomes blue when shot once and vaporizes after the next. Enemies are also capable of destroying blocks. Reflected own and enemy shots (along with mines on the floor) can kill the space ship, but extra lives can be earned by collecting power ups. One speciality is that the player can change the position of the gun; either left, right or central.

Power Drive (Europe)>Power Drive>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>U.S. Gold Ltd.>Rage Software Ltd.>Action>4>1-4 Players>Power Drive is an arcade racing game based around rally driving. Handbrake turns and lurid powerslides are both possible, and the steering is suitably loose.&#xA;There are 3 types of stages - individual time-trials, head-to-head races against the computer, and some skill tests.

Power Strike II (Japan, Europe)>Power Strike II>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Compile>Shooter>4>1 Player>Though it shares its Western title with the Master System shooter, GG Aleste II takes place in the far future, and not the steam-punk 1930s of Powerstrike II for the Master System. As in GG Aleste, you're the woman pilot of a space fighter faced with the task of saving the world by destroying a lot of alien spaceships and technological plantlife.&#xA;The gameplay in GG Aleste II has been further refined since its predecessor. Before starting out, you're given the choice between all the secondary weapons, with suggestive names such as Hammer Hawk or Rising Masher. These are upgraded in the same vein as in GG Aleste until you reach a frightening potential, covering the screen in bullets and napalm explosions. As a last resort, you're also given the ultimate weapon; a smart bomb destroying all enemies on-screen. Unfortunately, you're only given one bomb per life. As far as the weapons arsenal goes, this is the pinnacle in 8-bit Aleste versions. The graphics have been revised with a clearer look which turns out better on the Game Gear's fuzzy screen.&#xA;Perhaps taking a cue from the Sonic games of the time, the bonus levels are in 3-D, giving you the chance to earn bonus points and extra lives by shooting down as many baddies as possible in Galaxy Force style.
Predator 2 (USA, Europe)>Predator 2>1992>ESRB - K-A (Kids to Adults)>Arena Entertainment>Teeny Weeny Games, Ltd.>Action>2.6>1 Player>Predator 2 is similar to its 16-bit counterpart.

The Predator's three-dotted laser aim is a menace to avoid, which can kill either the hostages or Mike himself. Gang members killed drop drugs which can be picked up for points (and sent to the drugs squad). At the end of each level a boss must be defeated.&#xA;Mike can move and shoot in all 8 directions, but can only stop and shoot up, down, left and right. Besides his pistol, Mike can also collect new weapons such as grenades, shotguns, machine-guns and rifles. Body armor can be collected for health and med kits for extra lives.

The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.

Lucifer - Man Overboard!>1993>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Codemasters Software Company>Zeppelin Games>Platform>3.8>1-2 Players>Your name is Kevin Codner - rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and "shipsmarts". In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever. There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane. Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance. At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.

Sonic Drift 2 (Japan, USA)>Sonic Drift 2>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Driving>4>1-2 Players>Sonic Drift 2 is the sequel to Sonic Drift, also on the Game Gear and the first in the series to be released outside Japan. One of the new things in the sequel is a lag boost system, which means that anyone who is behind gets a boost to catch up again. This keeps the action in the game. Another new thing is that the gadgets touched while racing do not come into effect immediately. They need to be triggered manually by pressing up on the D-pad.&#xA;There are 3 GPs to compete in and each GP has 6 tracks. The names of the GPs are:&#xA;1. Purple Chaos GP&#xA;2. White Chaos GP&#xA;3. Blue Chaos GP&#xA;Racing skills can be improved in the Free Run mode on any of the tracks, or, with a Gear-to-Gear cable and a spare copy of the game, direct competition against another human player in the versus mode.

Curses! In order to remove them, Sonic must go through Eggman's great labyrinth and retrieve the Chaos Emeralds.&#xA;Like the later Sonic 3D Blast, this game uses a 3/4 isometric view. Make your way across four main zones, each divided into four stages. In order to complete a stage, you must find the three keys and open the exit before time runs out.&#xA;But watch out! Enemies want to hinder your progress. Knock them out with your Spin Dash. And be on the look out for obstacles like bumpers, flippers, teleporters, spikes, and conveyor belts.

He has built a new weapon, the Veg-O-Fortress on Mount Mobius and with it, he is transforming all creatures into robots. Sonic sneaks into the fortress and tries to stop Robotnik.&#xA;Use Sonic as a pinball in 4 dangerous levels.

Sonic The Hedgehog - Triple Trouble (USA, Europe)>Sonic The Hedgehog - Triple Trouble>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Aspect Co. Ltd.>Platform>4.2>1 Player>Dr. Robotnik has stolen all the Chaos Emeralds, yet again, but when the experiment for his new weapon goes wrong, the Emeralds get scattered across the island. While Sonic & Tails are out searching for them, Robotnik finds the yellow emerald and convinces Knuckles the Echidna that Sonic wants to steal all the other Emeralds. While all this is happening, Nack the Weasel seizes his chance to take the emeralds for himself while everyone else is pre-occupied. Now it's a 4-way race to retrieve the emeralds.&#xA;The gameplay is like the other Sonic titles, but this is only available on the Game Gear. The player can choose to play as Sonic or Tails (who can fly), and you're trying to reach the Chaos Emeralds before anyone else. A change from other Sonic games is that when hit, all rings are not lost, only a set amount (30-50 depending on the level) is lost.
Sonic The Hedgehog (World)>Sonic The Hedgehog>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Ancient Co. Ltd.>Platform>3.4>1 Player>SEGA's mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut in a famous Genesis title, but Sega's 8-bit systems got their own version of the platformer, featuring the same story and gameplay style, but different levels.&#xA;To stop the evil Dr. Robotnik, Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of the zones are based on those in the original game, but some are entirely new. Enemies (mechanized animals, defeated by Sonic's spikes when jumping or rolling) and power-ups (speed-ups, shields, extra lives) are mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik.&#xA;Sonic should also collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands. In a departure from the original game, these are not hidden in the special stages but somewhere in the regular levels.
Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (World)>Sonic The Hedgehog 2>1992>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>Aspect Co. Ltd.>Platform>3>1 Player>Coming back from the vacation Sonic took after foiling the plans of Dr Robotnik, he finds that Tails and all his other animal friends are missing. Sonic finds a letter waiting for him, that reads:&#xA;"Dear Sonic,&#xA;Robotnik is back, and he's captured all the animals on the island! He is holding me in a place called the Crystal Egg. In order to free me, you have to find and bring the six Chaos Emeralds.&#xA;Robotnik made me write this. He says he's waiting for you, and he's created six really nasty robots in order to 'get rid of you once and for all.' I don't know what he has planned, but Sonic, please be careful!&#xA;Sincerely, Tails.&#xA;That being more that enough motivation for him, Sonic races out to defeat Robotnik again.&#xA;The master system version is totally different than the Sonic 2 for Genesis. Tails obviously doesn't accompany you, like he can in the Genesis release. Sonic can also not do his infamous buzzsaw roll by simply ducking and pressing jump.
Soukoban (Japan)>Soukoban>1990>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Riverhillsoft>Thinking Rabbit>Puzzle>3.5>1 Player>Soko-Ban is a classic puzzle game, the basis of numerous clones in the later years. It is set in a warehouse. On each level, the player must push crates (from square to square) to get them onto designated spots; once each crate is on a marked spot, the level is complete. Crates can only be pushed one at a time (so two crates next to each other cannot be pushed together), and cannot be pulled--so it's possible to get a crate stuck in a corner, where it cannot be retrieved! By the last levels, you must plan 40 steps in advance.

Star Trek Generations - Beyond the Nexus (USA, Europe)>Star Trek Generations - Beyond the Nexus>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Absolute Entertainment, Inc.>Absolute Entertainment, Inc.>Action>2.8>1 Player>Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story: Captains Kirk and Picard must team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious Nexus energy ribbon.&#xA;The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.&#xA;On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.&#xA;Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.&#xA;The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.

Eventually, you travel through Mos Eisley and the Death Star as well.

Stargate (World)>Stargate>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Japan, Ltd.>Probe Software Ltd.>Action>3>1-2 Players>The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.&#xA;There are two game modes building on this basic concept:&#xA;1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.&#xA;Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.

Three buttons are used, one to jump, other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car. Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.&#xA;Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.

Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again...hopefully for good...&#xA;Streets of Rage 2 differs from the previous title in several ways.

T2 - The Arcade Game (USA, Europe)>T2 - The Arcade Game>1993>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.>Midway>Shooter>3>1 Player>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance.&#xA;Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.&#xA;T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.&#xA;Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).
Tails Adventures (World)>Tails Adventures>1995>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Aspect Co. Ltd.>Platform>3.7>1 Player>Before Tails met Sonic the Hedgehog he lived on Cocoa Island, a place that isn't on the map. It's an island pulled up by the Chaos Emeralds. Suddenly, while relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems like it's coming from inside the island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island. He also tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it's power. Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the US and European version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.&#xA;Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.

However, the game's six levels mirror the story-line of The Terminator movie very closely as you take on the role of Kyle Reese and his quest to save Sarah Connor from termination.&#xA;Because the game follows the movie so closely, the first mission which involves blowing up the SkyNet computer and escaping through time is one of the hardest and something that most players remember with love/hate.

Simple yet colorful symbol graphics make for endless hours of gameplay... akin to how one can play MineSweeper or Tetris on end, this game got into your head. Gameplay consisted of "flipping" tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile.

Ultimate Soccer (Japan, Europe)>Ultimate Soccer>1993>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Rage Software Ltd.>Soccer/Sports>3.2>1-2 Players>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.&#xA;The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.&#xA;Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field.&#xA;The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.

Woody Pop (USA, Europe)>Woody Pop>1991>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Action>3.6>1 Player>Every system must have a Breakout clone, and every self-respecting developer must have one, especially in the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito's Arkanoid. Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.&#xA;With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks", wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind - instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.&#xA;Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.&#xA;Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would otherwise have required several.

Also returning is the option to edit one's own team, with two team slots for saving to battery-backed RAM. Three different stadiums (open, turf and dome) can be selected and pitcher and batter order be freely set.Gameplay follows the standard model: players control all aspects of play, from a view behind the batter for batting and pitching and an overhead view of the field for running and fielding. On offense, players can lead off and steal bases, while defense allows for dives and jumps as well as unassisted plays.

The X-Men learn of a cure that has been developed by a scientist by the name of the Gamesmaster and ask for his help, but in order to obtain the antidote they must first compete in a series of games scattered throughout the world by beating up various enemies and avoiding pitfalls and traps.

X-Men (USA)>X-Men>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA of America, Inc.>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Platform>2.1>1 Player>X-Men is a sidescrolling beat'em up/platform game, much like its homonymous Mega Drive/ Genesis counterpart. Several X-Men characters are playable throughout the game. The player can choose from two characters from the start, Cyclops and Wolverine, and three Levels are accessible. In the course of the game, the player can unlock five other X-Men, namely Storm, Iceman, Rogue, Nightcrawler and Psylocke.&#xA;The story is that most of the X-Men have been kidnapped by Magneto, which is the reason why only Cyclops and Wolverine are available from the start. Apparently, unlocking the characters equals rescuing him. On the way, there several foes from the X-Men universe to beat, and at the end, Magneto once again needs a reprehension.&#xA;The basic mechanics of the game are punching, (double-)jumping and jump-kicking. Furthermore, pressing Start activates/ deactivates the characters mutant ability, for example Wolverine's claws or Cyclops' laser beams. Using it however drains a limited amount of energy, which can be refreshed by finding "X"-symbols.
Yogi Bear in Yogi Bear's Goldrush (USA) (Proto)>Yogi Bear in Yogi Bear's Goldrush>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Gametek>Empire Software>Platform>3.3>1 Player>Jellystone National Park is in trouble and it is up to Yogi Bear to save the day. The money needed to keep the park up and running for the winter has been stolen by an evil ghost named Jake, determined to shut down the park, and hidden by him in twelve safes somewhere in the park. The player must travel to six different locations to locate these safes (a forest, a pirate ship, the big city, an underground cavern, the old west and a final showdown with Jake).The gameplay is fairly simple: using Yogi, the player can travel from left to right and right to left on the screen; to kill certain enemies the hero must jump on them. Some enemies, however, can't be killed and must be avoided since Yogi has no weapons to harm them; he has to avoid various pitfalls and hazards as well.There are no true power-ups; instead, there are picnic baskets scattered throughout the stage, a 100 of which will grant the player an extra life. Likewise, there are icons labeled "1-UP" that will give the player a life, as well as health-refilling items. There are also hidden doors and areas that the player must find in order to locate the various safes. When Yogi enters these safes, he must collect the 25 gold coins to get a bar of gold; collecting 12 of these gold bars will give Yogi the money needed to win the game.
Yu Yu Hakusho - Horobishimono no Gyakushuu (Japan)>Yu Yu Hakusho - Horobishimono no Gyakushuu>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Action>3.7>1 Player>Yu Yu Hakusho: Horobishi Mono no Gyakushu is based on the the manga / anime series Yu Yu Hakusho, which is about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an "Underworld Detective" after being killed in a car accident while trying to save a child's life. His task is to investigate various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world.&#xA;The game is a classic side-scrolling beat'em up and offers several characters from the manga to play. Apart from, as expected, Yusuke the player can choose between Hiei, Kuwabara and Kurama. All characters have different values in five attributes like jumping or speed. The game offers some variations from the standard beta'em up formula: There are four different levels accessible from the beginning and can be played through in any order. However, after completing level, the player has to choose a new character he hasn't used yet for the next stage. If a character looses all his health, he has to fill it up with the health of the other characters and thus weakening them for the later levels. The game also switches to different mode for the boss fights. By turns, the player has to dodge an attack from the boss and then do a attack on his own by pressing Punch at the time when a moving cross-hair is over the boss.
Yu Yu Hakusho 2 - Gekitou! Nanakyou no Tatakai (Japan) (Translated En)>Yu Yu Hakusho 2 - Gekitou! Nanakyou no Tatakai>1994>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Minato Giken>Action>3.2>1-2 Players>Yu Yu Hakusho II: Gekito! Shichi Kyo no Tatakai is based on the the manga / anime series Yu Yu Hakusho, which is about the teenage delinquent Yusuke Urameshi, who is appointed as an "Underworld Detective" after being killed in a car accident while trying to save a child's life. His task is to investigate various cases involving ghosts and demons in the human world. While the first game was a side-scrolling beat 'em up featuring four characters from the manga, the second game is a one-on-one fighting game. The game though does take a different approach than games like Street Fighter, as you do not control the movement of your character, as both opponents stand still. You fight by pressing a combination of buttons to make your character perform a certain attack. The efficiency of the attack depends on two factors: The position of a moving cross-hair on the body of your opponent, which determines the spot you attack, and the amount of energy in a displayed "move gauge" which increases over the time. To perform a special attack, you also need a certain amount of Ki energy which is displayed in another gauge. The Ki regenerates while it's not used further, and without Ki a player is limited to only normal attacks. The triggered attacks are then displayed in an anime style animation sequence showing both opponents doing their corresponding move. In single player mode (a two-player mode is available via linking two Game Gears), one may either play a tournament or single fight against a character of one' choice. However, not all fighters are accessible from the beginning (the single combat mode also starts with one character less than the tournament mode) and must be unlocked by progressing in the game (progress is saved with passwords). Altogether, there are seven characters to choose from: Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, Itsuki, Toguro and Sensui Shinobu.

If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated, as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.
