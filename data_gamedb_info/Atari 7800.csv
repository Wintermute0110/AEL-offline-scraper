Mean 18 Ultimate Golf (USA)>Mean 18 Ultimate Golf >1989>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari Corporation>Accolade, Inc.>Golf/Sports>2.0>1-2 Players>Pebbele Beach and St. Andrews are two of the courses on offer in this golf simulation, released in the early years of 16-bit technology. The three-click control system was used, whereby the first click starts the swing, the second sets the power, and the third sets draw or fade.&#xA;Beginner and Expert difficulty options are given - the latter mode has more pronounced draw and fade effects, making the timing of the third click even more crucial. You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn't choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren't a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Begginer/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring. A uniquie feature for the day was the course designer, which was quite versatile with practice.
Meltdown (USA)>Meltdown >1990>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atari Corporation>Atari Corporation>Shooter>2.0>1 Player>Meltdown is an arcade action game similar to Reactor. On the screen you will see a representation of a nuclear reactor; numerous control rods are located in the center of the screen, with the reactor walls around the edges. Inside the reactor are numerous (and dangerous) particles which will damage the control rods if they collide. Using the light gun, you need to shoot and destroy the various particles before the control rods are destroyed. As the control rods take damage, the walls of the reactor will slowly cave inward, decreasing the amount of space available. From time to time power crystals may appear; if shot, these will provide bonuses such as extra points, control rod repair, temporarily freeze the particles, more powerful shots, and more. The game ends when the control rods have been completely destroyed causing the reactor to meltdown.

The lands have become cursed, however, and there will be many obstacles on your quest including killer bats, zombies, werewolves and more. Jimmy has two life meters, one for health and one for blood. Some creatures are poisonous on contact and reduce the blood meter, while others reduce the health meter. If either runs out, the game is over. Throughout the game, Grampa's spirit will be in contact with Jimmy and can occasionally provide clues or other useful information. The game features an isometric point of view, and in some larger areas the screen will scroll horizontally or vertically to follow the action.

One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.&#xA;Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.&#xA;Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of "Junior".
