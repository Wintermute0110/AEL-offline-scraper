Akira (Europe)>Akira>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>International Computer Entertainment Ltd.>International Computer Entertainment Ltd.>Arcade - Miscellaneous>1.9>1 Player>Akira is a side-scrolling action game based on the anime film of the same title.&#xA;In the first few levels you have to guide the main character Kaneda through an obstruction filled road on his motorcycle. Obstacles come in the form of roadblocks, holes in the road, which must be jumped with the use of a ramp, and a variety of characters on the road who throw bombs at you. The roadblocks can only be cleared by grenades which you pick up by knocking over traffic cones. You must also make it to the end of the level without running out of fuel.&#xA;After the motorcycle levels there are five platform levels. The object of these levels is basically to kill everyone you come in contact with, each kill adding to a meter which you have to fill to complete the level.
Alfred Chicken (Europe)>Alfred Chicken>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Mindscape International Ltd.>Twilight>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>2.8>1 Player>Alfred the chicken must rescue his friends and his bird (pardon the pun) Floella from the Meka Chickens. The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.&#xA;Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.
Alien Breed - Tower Assault (Europe)>Alien Breed - Tower Assault>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Team17 Software Limited>Team17 Software Limited>Shoot'em Up - Gauntlet>3.9>1-2 Players>A scientific outpost on a far off planet has been attacked. Nothing is known about the attackers, since all communications have been destroyed. A team of marines is dispatched to investigate and destroy the unknown invaders. As their dropships enter the atmosphere and approach the base, the defence lasers, damaged in the onslaught, move into action. They launch wild bursts of laser fire at the approaching marines, who are not prepared and take heavy losses. Rookies Nash and Jordan crash-land, and must fight off the alien force.&#xA;As with the previous Alien Breed, the gameplay is viewed from above. Your soldier shoots his way through the levels, collecting keys, ammunition and credits along the way. Computers can be logged into to buy new weapons. A new 'retreat' mode allows you to fire while moving backwards.&#xA;The game is largely non-linear, as most levels have multiple exits, and the game can be moved through in different ways. There is a variety of indoor and outdoor levels, although you spend most time inside some of the multi-level towers. After activating a self-destruct mechanism, you must escape the building quickly.
Alien Breed '92 Special Edition & Qwak (Europe)>Alien Breed '92 Special Edition & Qwak>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Team17 Software Limited>Team17 Software Limited>Shoot'em Up - Gauntlet>4.5>1-2 Players>A compilation which includes the following games on one CD: Alien Breed '92 Special Edition: An interrim between Alien Breed and its sequel. Gameplay is the same as its predecessor - each level is a maze to be navigated through, while fighting off hordes of aliens. The Special Edition 92 includes 12 new levels and a bunch of new features: "dark missions" in which only the glowing blue eyes of the aliens are visible, and the ability to jump to a level by means of a code.&#xA;Quak:In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.

The 3D engine uses fairly small screen graphics, but these include full floors and ceilings with detailed shading, doors, vertical position variations, lifts and transporters. The CD version includes extra atmospheric sound, while fast processors and extra FastRAM are also supported.

Arcade Pool (Europe)>Arcade Pool>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Team17 Software Limited>Team17 Software Limited>Sports - Snooker/Pool>3.1>1-8 Players>An overhead viewed pool game designed to be easy to control. The game includes the most standard games of pool (UK and US 8-ball and the fast-paced 9-ball game), each with customisable rules, computer players of variable difficulties, and 2-player options.&#xA;There's also a Survivor mode, which is similar to the early Pool arcade game, in that you're playing alone and have to clear the table without missing more than 3 times. Speed Pool involved clearing the table as quickly as you can - 2 minutes can be considered a good time.&#xA;The game includes automatic enhancements for accelerated systems, those with more than 1Mb of memory, or the AGA chip set (so a standard A1200 wins on all 3 counts)
ATR - All Terrain Racing (Europe)>ATR - All Terrain Racing>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Team17 Software Limited>Team17 Software Limited>Racing - Cars>4.8>1-2 Players>ATR: All Terrain Racing is an overhead racing game from Team 17 featuring a variety of circuits including snow, forest and seaside based ones.

Banshee (Europe)>Banshee>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Core Design Ltd.>Core Design Ltd.>Shoot'em Up - Vertical>3.5>1-2 Players>A vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up from the old school, with similarities to games like 1942 and SWIV. There are lots of big, brash enemy vehicles to take on, plus individual soldiers (these often lie in a pool of blood afterwards, a gruesome sight making full use of AGA graphics) and civilians. Many of the enemies have good hiding places and can emerge surprisingly, Commando-style.&#xA;There are four large levels, which also scroll a small amount horizontally, the idea being that you can evade some opposition. There's a special loop-the-loop type feature available, which can double as an attack or an evasive move.
Base Jumpers (Europe)>Base Jumpers>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Rasputin Software>Shadow Software>Arcade - Miscellaneous>3.2>1-2 Players>Base Jumpers was the second release by Aaron and Adam Fothergill's Shadow Software outfit for publisher Rasputin and was very simple in concept. In a 2D platform gaming style, players run up to the top of towers, trying to combine 3 letter pickups to collect plain daft bonuses (there were something like 500 different 3 letter combinations) and then jump off the building and base jump down the outside. The last player to avoid the sticky out bits of the building and successfully open their parachute before becoming pavement art wins the round.
Battle Chess (Europe)>Battle Chess>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Interplay Productions, Inc.>Interplay Productions, Inc.>Board Games - Chess>3.1>1-2 Players>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation.&#xA;The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels.&#xA;Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.
Battletoads (Europe)>Battletoads>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Mindscape International Ltd.>Rare, Ltd.>Arcade - Miscellaneous>4.4>1 Player>The Dark Queen has attacked and kidnapped (toadnapped?) your best buddy..

Battletoads don't cry, hide or call for help! And they certainly don't whimper! They get MAD then they get EVEN! So grab your blaster, hop on the Toadster and go get 'em!&#xA;You will control a battletoad through various levels. Some are side-scrolling beat-em-ups, other are vertical drops down a shaft, fighting as you go, others have you riding a rocket or surfboard, shooting or avoiding enemies. At the end of each area, there is a boss. In some areas, about half-way through, you may have a mini-boss.
Beavers (Europe)>Beavers>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Grandslam Video Ltd.>Arc Developments>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>3.1>1 Player>The Beavers Supergroup and their megastar leader Jethro have reached number one in the Charts and are a big hit in all of the forest discos. Unfortunately, the previous number one group, The Rappin' Rabbit Rockers, are very angry at the Beavers success. They put a plan into action. Jethro's wife was kidnapped and is being held hostage. She will not be released until the Beavers are disbanded and all their master tapes are destroyed. Jethro is determined not to let his Beaver comrades down. He sets off to rescue his kidnapped wife with the help of his children.&#xA;You take the role of Jethro. The aim of the game is to make your way through each level of the game, overcoming the various Rabbits allies you will encounter. For every six levels of the game that you complete, you will be given a code so that he can continue his struggle at a later date. However, the Rabbits don't take too kindly to this, so they send their biggest and most dangerous followers to attack you just prior to him being given the code. To defeat these large beasts, use your spin attack to propel the missiles back at them. Watch out, as rocks are too heavy to bat with your tail and you will use an energy point in trying.&#xA;If fighting is not enough, you must collect Charisma Stars to maintain your charisma that you will need to complete a level.&#xA;There are also Life Stars which have the ability to give you another life, but to get these, you must sneak up on them or the will move out of your reach. To keep your helpful children from losing interest, you must find Raccoon Skin Hats to give as gifts to stay in their favor. There are switches serving different functions that need to be activated. Doors will have to be entered to locate secret rooms that may contain the stars or other valuable objects. There are Rubber Leaves that may be needed to access those hard to reach areas. Just try jumping on them. Sometimes to reach the top of a level, clouds may have to be used. Some are more solid than the others. Mushroom Seeds can be used to grow your own platform to access other platforms. You may come across machinery that activate lifts or send a jet of steam into the air. You will need a spanner to start these up. Its all up to you.
Beneath A Steel Sky (Europe)>Beneath A Steel Sky>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd.>Revolution Software Ltd.>Adventure - Point and Click>2.6>1 Player>In futuristic Australia, there are giant cities owned solely by corporations, separated by a giant wasteland known as The Gap. When Robert Foster's Gap-dwelling tribe is killed by soldiers from Union City who capture him, everything changes for him. After a narrow escape from the helicopter bringing him there as it inexplicably crashes, Robert and his droid Joey must search the decaying city, attempting to befriend both the snobby rich and the frustrated poor as the two attempt to get out of the city, but in the middle of everything they uncover the dark truth about LINC, the bizarre computer which makes the city tick.&#xA;Using the then revolutionary Virtual Theatre engine, BASS' characters can move freely independent of the player, allowing the game world to be much more dynamic than anything seen before (other than Virtual Theatre's debut game, the less popular Lure of the Temptress). Otherwise, the engine provides tried and true point-and-click adventure gameplay.&#xA;The iPhone version introduces a touch-based interface, new animated movies by Dave Gibbons, a context-sensitive hint system and a remastered audio track.
Benefactor (Europe)>Benefactor>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Psygnosis Limited>Digital Illusions CE AB>Arcade - Logical Game>3.4>1 Player>As Ben E Factor himself, you must travel through the six moons of Minniat, on which the peaceful and good-natured people of Lullyat have been kidnapped. These Merry Men each have their own potential skill once rescued, so releasing them in the right order is often essential for completing a level. Some Merry Men have grey suits - this marks them out as joyless and awkward characters which must be guided through a coloring machine.&#xA;The Miniation people have loaded the 60 levels with various nasties, ranging from slugs (slow, but must be jumped), Rock Men (those with sharp backs are more dangerous, but both are quite nippy), spiked teeth emerging from manholes, and so on. A large map is provided, and at any point you can pause the game and scroll around the map, which makes the forward planning easier.
Black Viper (Europe)>Black Viper>1996>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>neo Software Produktions GmbH>Light Shock Software s.n.c.>Shoot'em Up - Racing>4.6>1 Player>Black Viper takes inspiration from games such as Fire and Forget and Chase H.Q., replacing the fast car with an armed motorcycle. As usual, this game takes place after a terrible nuclear war, with you playing as the son of a lost freedom fighter.&#xA;The freedom fighters try to recapture the remaining cities from the mercenaries acting on behalf of the underground people who instigated the war in the first place. To do this, you must travel from city to city on the open roads, arriving within a given time frame. This is difficult due to the crowded roads, but luckily you can blow up most other vehicles with your gun. As the game progresses, enemy vehicles become harder, requiring more shots to be taken out. Luckily, your bike may be upgraded in the shop between levels.&#xA;Black Viper has a certain arcade-ish look to its graphics, a jukebox for choosing soundtracks, and comes in both OCS and AGA versions.
Brian the Lion (Europe)>Brian the Lion>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Psygnosis Limited>Reflections Interactive Limited>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>4.0>1 Player>In this game, you play Brian, the lion that closely resembles the Paddle Pop mascot. You must carry out the task of rescuing your friend Chris the Crystal, who has been kidnapped by Geeza the Dragon. His other warped jungle animal friends, Barry the Bear and Graeme the Gorilla, prevent you from getting to him and rescuing your friend.&#xA;Your job is to run through each level, destroying enemies that get in your way by either "clawing" them or jumping on their heads. Along the way, collect as many crystals as you can so that you can use them at the shop to buy extra lives, credits, heavenly hit points, jinormous jumps, really raj roars (which also kills enemies), and splendid speed. There are many secret areas in a level, some will take you on a different route other than the one you take when you reach the level exit. However, you must complete certain levels in order to progress further in the game, but you can return to a level that you have completed. You are given enough time to complete the level. If you run out of time before you reach the exit, you will receive no bonus. Furthermore, you do not get to access one of the three bonus levels that you can choose from if you do.
Brutal - Paws of Fury (Europe)>Brutal - Paws of Fury>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>GameTek UK Ltd.>Software Sorcery>Arcade - Beat'em Up>2.6>1 Player>The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself.&#xA;Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown.&#xA;During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a "taunt" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen.&#xA;Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player.&#xA;The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.&#xA;In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.
Brutal Football - Brutal Sports Series (Europe)>Brutal Football - Brutal Sports Series>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Teque London Ltd.>Sports - American Football>3.9>1-4 Players>Similar to Speedball 2 in many ways, this is an ultra-violent sports game. Matches last 7 minutes, and the aim is to get the ball into a goal at each end, guarded by a net-minder. The ball can be thrown or kicked, and is an oval, resulting in frequent up-and-under type kicks.&#xA;The gameplay is fast and flowing, and has one rule - if you can't get the ball, get the man, and decapitate him if possible. Bonus and non-bonus items appear on the pitch, such as bombs to throw at opponents, rabbits to speed up the current player, or tortoises to slow him down.&#xA;Teams consist of humans and aliens, many of which have their own unique skills. There's a lot of blood and flailing limbs, giving things a gruesomely humorous edge. There are four leagues to progress through, plus a knockout cup and single matches.

Bubble And Squeak (Europe)>Bubble And Squeak>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Audiogenic Software Ltd.>Fox Williams>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>3.7>1 Player>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.&#xA;Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.&#xA;Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back.&#xA;In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place underwater - completing these earns bonuses.
Bump 'n' Burn (Europe)>Bump 'n' Burn>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Grandslam Video Ltd.>Softeyes>Racing - Cars>3.2>1-2 Players>Mario Kart is taken one step further in this racer. The computer racers include Loretta L'Amour, the Buck-Toothed Beavers, and the uncompromising Colonel Carnage, each of which have individual looking cars, varied weapons, and some attempts at humour and pathos.&#xA;The courses are quite lengthy, and are laden with hazards and power-ups such as oil slicks and homing missiles. The computer cars appear to be faster when behind you than when in front - strange.&#xA;The handling is deliberately arcadey, with fast acceleration and braking as well as the chance to brake and steer at the same time. The graphics are third-person, with a split-screen option, in the grand Mario Kart / OutRun tradition.
Cannon Fodder (Europe)>Cannon Fodder>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Virgin Interactive Entertainment (Europe) Ltd.>Sensible Software>Shoot'em Up - Miscellaneous>3.6>1 Player>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once).&#xA;Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.
Castles II - Siege & Conquest (Europe)>Castles II - Siege & Conquest>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Interplay Productions, Inc.>Quicksilver Software, Inc.>Strategy - Miscellaneous>3.2>1 Player>Castles II expands on the original by changing the interface and adding video cutscenes on the CD-based versions.&#xA;You choose to be one of five feuding lords vying for the Crown.

You have to reach 7,000 points to petition the Pope for the throne, and then you have to maintain those points for 4-5 game months to win the game.

To do this he must retrieve the King's Sceptre.Cedric takes the basic adventure game elements of object manipulation, puzzle solving, and conversations involving choosing from a range of pre-set sentences. However, it sets them in an arcade platform context. The options are hidden most of the time, and there's a fair supply of bad guys to be dispatched, either with a sword or by jumping on their heads. There are 11 levels of this to negotiate, with lots of jumps to navigate. Extra lives and improved weapons can be collected along the way.

Onboard the ship, you can save/load game, visit the bar to get the latest gossip, or go on to the next mission briefing, and the 3D space combat part. The 3D space combat has you sitting in the cockpit, where you control the craft like roll, turn, up/down, afterburner, as well as fire guns and launch missiles. There are four different crafts on the Confed side, each with different flight characteristics and armament. You will have a wingman on each mission, and you should keep the wingman alive as the wingman will help you if you issue the right orders. You can also taunt the enemy. You'll be fighting several different types of enemy fighters and capital ships, and even combat a few Kilrathi aces. When the mission is complete, land back onboard the ship and get ready for the next one. The campaign tree have both winning and losing paths.
Dark Seed (Europe)>Dark Seed>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Cyberdreams, Inc.>Cyberdreams, Inc.>Adventure - Point and Click>4.2>1 Player>Dark Seed is an adventure game which capitalizes on the drawings of famous horror designer H. R. Giger as a source of background artwork and inspiration.&#xA;You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That's when trouble begin. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep...&#xA;... and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.
Death Mask (Europe)>Death Mask>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Alternative Software Ltd.>Apache Software Limited>Shoot'em Up - FPS>2.7>1-2 Players>Doom on the 7Mhz, 16-colour, 1Mb Amiga 500 might sound unrealistic, but this is one of a handful of games that managed it, and the first full Doom-style game for the Amiga.&#xA;Unusually the multiplayer game was split-screen, which didn't really work because you could sneak a look into the other window to see where your opponent was - it's not exactly full of suspense.&#xA;The major compromises in getting the game onto the A500 are the graphics, which lack texture-mapping, and the trick-3D used where the characters don't rotate smoothly in 360 degrees, but jerk through a small range of viewpoints, a la Dungeon Master. Only half the screen is used for the actual motion as well, with the rest reserved for RPG-style artwork - which is obviously superfluous because the 2-player game doesn't have it. It's a throwback to the first Lotus game of all things. You can even turn the animation off.&#xA;In one-player mode there are 34 levels, accessed via passwords, 3 lives, and lots of powerup weapons. If one player completes the level, both advance to the next one (like Lotus 2, funnily enough. I guess I ought to think of a similarity to Lotus 3, just to complete the set). There's also the standard Death Match mode.
Deep Core (Europe)>Deep Core>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>International Computer Entertainment Ltd.>Dynafield Systems International>Shoot'em Up - Platformer>2.3>1 Player>An underwater nuclear research base has been invaded by a hostile craft. Captain Dawnrazer is sent in to wipe up the aliens and other beings, and that's where you come in. Deep Core is a dark platform adventure with similarities to Gods. There are nine main levels, each of which is split into sub-levels and also has bonus sections leading off from it. Each of the 6 weapons which are on offer can be boosted in power.
Defender of the Crown II (Europe)>Defender of the Crown II>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Commodore Electronics Ltd.>Sachs Enterprises>Strategy - Miscellaneous>4.2>1 Player>King Richard has been imprisoned on his way back from the crusades. In order to free him 20,000 pounds worth of ransom money must be gathered. Of course the nobles of the land aren't willing to give up their wealth, so this money must be obtained through tournaments, raids and outright battle against individual provinces. All of the nobles have castles, so at times siege equipment must be used.&#xA;Defender of the Crown II is the sequel to the smash hit Defender of the Crown. It improves over the game by upgrading the arcade sequences. Here, unlike the original game; sword fighting is about method and is not just wild clicking of the mouse button. The siege sequence is also enhanced with different types of ammo (such as Greek fire) to toss into the castle. The jousting is now easier to control and the lance no longer bounces around wildly.
Dennis (Europe)>Dennis>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Ocean Software Ltd.>Citizen Software>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>2.0>1 Player>This game brings the US cartoon character Dennis the Menace's menacing treatment of poor old Mr. Wilson to the computer screen, around the time of the film also released in 1993.&#xA;Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilson's house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to top-right anyway.&#xA;Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice between music and sound effects is offered.
Diggers (Europe)>Diggers>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Brain - Puzzle>3.9>1 Player>Diggers is a Lemmings-style puzzle game where you command five alien miners ( from a choice of four clans ) and various gadgets to dig for treasure. The game is divided in excavation areas. Each area has a set amount of money you must raise before moving into the next one. To do so, you must sell your collected treasure to the bank.&#xA;You select your "Diggers" by clicking on them with the left mouse button, and making them do a desired action by right-clicking on the screen and choosing from a icon menu.&#xA;Each clan has different characteristics and stats: for example the Grablins clan resembles fantasy dwarfs and has the fastest diggers. The Quarriors clan has the strongest miners, less likely to die in a fight with enemy diggers.
Diggers & Oscar (Europe)>Diggers & Oscar>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Commodore>Flair Software Ltd.|Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Brain - Puzzle / Platformer>3.5>1 Player>A two game compilation that came packaged with the Amiga CD32 system.&#xA;Diggers is a side-scrolling strategy game set on the planet Zarg. The aim is to use one of four races to mine the planet, whilst competing with the other three races.&#xA;Oscar is a side-scrolling cartoon platformer. You guide Oscar through nine movie-based levels collecting Oscar statues - the iconic golden statues from the Academy Awards.
Disposable Hero (Europe)>Disposable Hero>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Gremlin Interactive Ltd.>Euphoria>Shoot'em Up - Horizontal>2.7>1 Player>This horizontally scrolling R-Type-influenced shoot 'em up features 5 levels to blast through, with bosses at the end of each level as well as tough mini-bosses as you go through it. There are four difficulty levels, with the easiest acting as a trainer, as you can't reach the final level or complete the game properly with it. You can customize exactly how loud the music and sound effects are relative to each other, and there lots of subtle visual effects, such as a smoke haze coming off your ship as it incurs gradual damage.&#xA;The game's power-up system is worthy of note. Rather than simply picking up new weapons, or all-purpose tokens which can be traded in at the press of a button, you collect blueprints for a total of 32 different weapons as well as upgrades to the maximum amount of power your ship can unleash at a time. Once you reach a power-up bay (which are depicted as blue domes at the base of the level), you can add or remove weapons so as to maximize your attack capabilities.
Donk! - The Samurai Duck! (Europe)>Donk! - The Samurai Duck!>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Supervision Entertainment Ltd.>Hidden, The|Supervision Entertainment Ltd.>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>2.9>1-2 Players>Donk is an ordinary duck who benefits from having been raised by samurai warriors, who've taught him everything they know about combat psychologies, strategies and skills. To prove himself he has set off to collect crystals from 112 levels of earth.&#xA;Once you collect the target quota of gems, you must escape form each level through one of its many exits, giving the game a similar structure to Alien Breed: Tower Assault. Magical powers can be collected along the way, including the ability to turn into an inflatable toy duck, which makes it possible to float across water. There is a simultaneous split-screen 2-player mode included as well.
Dragonstone (Europe)>Dragonstone>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Core Design Ltd.>Core Design Ltd.>Adventure - Arcade Isometric>3.2>1-2 Players>The pseudo-sequel to Darkmere, Dragonstone has a look and feel influenced by Zelda, making it stand out from the Dungeon Master-influenced bulk of role-playing games for the Amiga.&#xA;Agon is the villain whose hordes you must destroy. The game is split across 7 multi-directional levels, taking in forests and caves in a fantasy setting. You are armed with a sword and a special energy-bolt attack, which can be charged up. Some vanquished enemies discard food or gold; there are shops in which to spend this.
Emerald Mines (Europe)>Emerald Mines>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Almathera Systems>Almathera Systems>Arcade - Boulderdash>3.9>1-2 Players>The Emerald Mines CD contains the Boulder Dash-clone Emerald Mine and a collection of 177 level sets for it, each of them containing 80 levels.

The player must find a way to the lower depths of the planet to rescue the terraforming team and defeat the evil Triax!
Fears (Europe)>Fears>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Attic Entertainment Software GmbH>BOMB Software|Manyk Ltd>Shoot'em Up - FPS>2.7>1 Player>One of the numerous Doom style games for the Amiga in the mid 90s. Like Gloom, it was published by Guildhall Leisure, who gave the Amiga a lot of time in that era.&#xA;Fears took the approach of having full-screen, though relatively low-resolution, graphics. The level landscapes feature lots of stairways and lifts, giving it a psuedo-3D feel. The game is played across 30 levels., with a level designer also included. The one-player game has 3 difficulty levels, while multi-player action is available via a null-modem cable.
Fields of Glory (Europe)>Fields of Glory>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>MicroProse Ltd.>MicroProse Ltd.>Strategy - War>3.8>1 Player>Originally released in 1993, this historical combat simulation deals with the wars of Napoleon after his return from exile in Elba in 1815.&#xA;The game is close to historical facts and therefore can be recommended to provide good information about this period of European history.
Fightin' Spirit (Europe)>Fightin' Spirit>1996>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>neo Software Produktions GmbH>Light Shock Software s.n.c.>Arcade - Beat'em Up>4.3>1-8 Players>Fightin' Spirit is a one-on-one beat 'em up centred around a competition by a gang overlord to find new heavies for his organisation. Ten tough-nuts have come forward, such as Burke the squaddie and Eric the biker. Many of these have special moves in which they can turn into an animal - Tong Lee can become a tiger and Lorente a puma.&#xA;Special moves are selected using a combination of joystick/pad movements followed by a tap of fire. The game can be played with or without blood, and in a turbo speed mode, with tournament and tag-team options for potential multi-player tournaments. The game supports CD32 controllers as well as one-button joysticks.
Fire & Ice - The Daring Adventures of Cool Coyote (Europe)>Fire & Ice - The Daring Adventures of Cool Coyote>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Renegade Software>Graftgold Creative Software>Shoot'em Up - Platformer>4.3>1 Player>The background story of Fire & Ice is quick to tell: A coyote (you) runs, throwing ice cubes, through various worlds. In the levels you must jump on platforms and kill your enemies. The enemies (for example, birds and penguins) can be shot with your ice cubes; they become frozen, so you smash them. Sometimes they leave part of a key behind after they're destroyed. The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world.&#xA;In this &quot;jump & run&quot; you can also get some power-ups. You can find some coyote puppies; these puppies follow you, are invulnerable, and also shoot enemies. In higher regions you find some snow-flakes; enough of these and you get a great snowball for freezing more enemies on the screen.
Fireforce (Europe)>Fireforce>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>International Computer Entertainment Ltd.>International Computer Entertainment Ltd.>Arcade - Miscellaneous>3.7>1-8 Players>This shoot 'em up scrolls horizontally with gameplay on a number of different levels, similarly to Green Beret. You play an elite soldier dropped behind enemy lines who must take out the enemy forces. You can choose your weapons and ammunition before starting, including a wide range of guns as well as grenades and a trusty pocket-knife. You'll have to avoid land mines and destroy bridges along the way. Defeated enemies release further weapons.
Fly Harder (Europe)>Fly Harder>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Starbyte Software>Shoot'em Up - Multi-Directional>3.5>1 Player>Your homeland's precious limited energy is being taken advantage of by the evil Thargoid Empire, and you and your spaceship must do something about it. There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.&#xA;The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.
Frontier - Elite II (Europe)>Frontier - Elite II>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Gametek Ltd>David Braben>Simulation - Space>1.9>1 Player>Frontier: Elite 2 is, of course, the sequel to Elite and it continues in much the same way. You have a ship and limited funds, and nowhere to go but out into space. Trade, fight, hunt criminals, work for the various governments, anything goes in Frontier. There are few, if any, limits on what you can do or where you can go. And Frontier's universe (with approx. 100,000,000,000 planets and moons) is so big you'll never see the end of it.
Fury of the Furries (Europe)>Fury of the Furries>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Kalisto>Atreid Concept SA>Arcade - Logical Game>2.8>1 Player>In Fury of the Furries, you control a cute, round creature called Tiny, who must defeat "the wicked one" who has captured the King, and turned all the Tinies into mindless monsters. Fortunately your Tiny has special powers. It can transform himself into a swimmer, rock eater, fireball spitter, or rope swinger during its quest.&#xA;The game takes place on a huge island separated into eight regions: Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village, and finally the Castle.&#xA;For the US release, the title was changed to 'Pac-In-Time'. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed : the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek, Super Skweek, Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.

Global Effect (Europe)>Global Effect>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Strategy - War>2.9>1 Player>Essentially similar to The Settlers AKA Serf City, Global Effect involves building up a sound local economy before going out to attack other nations and rule the world. Cities must contain housing, food sources and power supplies, which is where it gets complicated. You can choose the environmental settings of the game, in a similar way to Civilization - an icy world or a post-apocalyptic one make things much tougher.&#xA;Environmental factors play the biggest part in this game, as you have to use efficient power sources if possible. You only get a certain level of power at the start of the game, and have to build enough 'green' things to increase it further - trees are the most effective.&#xA;Once you have a fully functional city capable of supporting military units of any quality, these can be directed off into battle by giving them pre-planned flight paths which can be over-ridden if need be.&#xA;Two-player games can be played via null-modem cables, even across different systems.
Gloom (Europe)>Gloom>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Guildhall Leisure Services Ltd.>Black Magic Software>Shoot'em Up - FPS>4.0>1 Player>As the title implies, Gloom is an attempt at recreating Doom for the Amiga. In 1995 this was a big target for programmers, as it was felt that the Amiga 1200 was capable of bringing the first person 3D action to life.&#xA;Gloom was written by New Zealand's respected Acid Software team, and published by Guildhall who supported the Amiga heavily in its later years. The emphasis was placed on action, rather than collecting keys and negotiating through maps.

The computer racers include Loretta L'Amour, the Buck-Toothed Beavers, and the uncompromising Colonel Carnage, each of which have individual looking cars, varied weapons, and some attempts at humour and pathos.&#xA;•Nick Faldo's Championship Golf: Arc Developments created a 3D game world called Reality3 for this simulation, licensed around one of Britain's top players. There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players.&#xA;•Jetstrike: In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your "borrowed" aircraft.

The game is viewed in full 3D, and the camera angle can be adjusted. CD32 controllers are recommended, although keyboard and mouse are also available.
Gulp!

The distress signal from planet Earth reaches a far away underwater planet and the inhabitants decide to rescue us. They send a spaceship with Captain Gulp and the Aquarons towards our star system and it's the player's job to see that they are successful!&#xA;In Gulp!, the player controls a number of fish swimming in water filled tubes. The game takes its inspiration from Lemmings - like in the aforementioned game, you have to pick specific "jobs" for some of your fish to solve the puzzles in each level. A lot of the gameplay revolves around flipping switches in the correct order to alter the water flow within the pipes. In some of the later levels, the fish crew has to be split in multiple groups to finish the stages. The goal of each level is to get the fish to the exit, and all this has to be done within a time limit.

There are now 9 large missions to take on, with a largely linear progression in the order these are played. You can choose a team of 4 from 8 character classes, adding rangers, mystics, elves and clerics to the original game's 4. The exact abilities of these can be customized before you start.&#xA;The game is controlled using action icons at the bottom of a screen to set the basic instructions to move, fight, open doors, search for keys and so on. Characters can move individually, allowing for diverse strategies based on the specific strengths and weaknesses of these characters.

Passwords are offered for each level.

Elvin has assembled a crack team of robots within his high-security tower - the only way to stop him unleashing them is to destroy them first.&#xA;Gameplay is puzzle-oriented as before, although the levels are now scrolling, and as such much larger than before. Each one contains objects to pick up to enable you to take on the level's final puzzle of putting them together in sliding-block form. There are lots of bonus games, ranging from a Simon title to standard shoot 'em ups.&#xA;A bonus for old-timers is provided in the form of a near-perfect remake of the C64 original.

Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them.&#xA;The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.

Jetstrike (Europe)>Jetstrike>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Rasputin Software>Shadow Software>Shoot'em Up - Multi-Directional>2.5>1 Player>MIS, the FBI, NASA, the KGB, MOSSAD and even top secret agents from the North Beckinsdale Pigeon Fancier's Association swung into action immediately. They were swiftly halted in their tracks when they received a top level order warning of a massive campaign of bribery of government officials in all countries. It appeared that any overt attempt to destroy SPUDD would result in the downfall of most of the world's governments. SPUDD-controlled leaders would soon rise to replace them.&#xA;As the situation has worsened by the day, and SPUDD's forces have grown from strength to strength, the various agencies have now put together an underground task force which they hope will combat the growing threat. This elite task force comprises one agent (yourself - nice of you to volunteer by the way), a highly trained mechanic called Harry, and a field support officer to assign missions. The plan is that you will "borrow" aircraft from local air forces and carry out secret strike missions on SPUDD forces while they are still small enough to have to stay hidden. Hopefully, by damaging their supply lines, factories and control centres, you should be able to ruin their plans of world domination. However, if you wreck too many expensive aircraft, your sponsors will not be able to cover for you, resulting in your sent back to the secret agent's Basic Training School.&#xA;In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your "borrowed" aircraft. Your Commanding Officer will give you a mission objective which you have to try to achieve without being shot down, blown up or crashing into mountains.&#xA;Jetstrike is an 2D side-scrolling action game like Brøderbund's Wings of Fury. The great difference between these games is, in Jetstike it's possible to use 32 aircraft and 6 helicopters in several combat-missions or to be a part of the Aerolympics.
John Barnes European Football (Europe)>John Barnes European Football>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Sports - Football/Soccer>2.4>1 Player>Released to coincide with the 1992 European Football Championships, and licensed around Jamaican-born Liverpool star John Barnes.&#xA;The gameplay is superficially similar to Krisalis' previous Manchester United Europe title. The action is viewed from side-on and overhead, giving a slight forced perspective.&#xA;Unlike Manchester United Europe, only a small amount of the pitch is visible at a time, which makes the game faster, but amkes long-range passing harder (perhaps to make the game more like Barnes' own style)&#xA;Control is precise and the ball sticks to your feet to some extent. The only teams included are the 8 qualifiers for the 1992 European Championships, and that is the only tournament. You can play either as the nearest player to the ball, ro always be Barnes.
Jungle Strike (Europe)>Jungle Strike>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Ocean Software Ltd.>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Shoot'em Up - Isometric>4.2>1 Player>Some time after Operation Desert Strike, Ibn Kilbaba, son of Kilbaba S.R, threatens to annihilate America. After his father was killed, the people who were under his control, sent his son running off, along with his father's money and nuclear weapons program. Kilbaba, more ruthless than his father, longs for revenge of his father's death and decides to shed the blood of those who killed him, the Americans. Already armed, Kilbaba hires Carlos Ortega to help him set up his Nuclear Weapons program, deep in South America. Carlos Ortega, the world's most notorious druglord, also yearns to seek revenge. With his own private army, armed with the most hi-tech weapons, he's ready to fight America at all costs.&#xA;Because of this threat, you're hired again to battle these two characters, following their paths in the jungles of South America. Armed with the Commache, numerous other vehicles, and destructive weapons, you must take out their private army. Blow up the enemy with your hellfires, hydras, chain guns. Use the watercraft to launch mines at enemy ships. Pull off a drive-by on the enemy with guns on the side. Take out the evil duo and forever rid this threat...in the jungle!
Kang Fu (Europe)>Kang Fu>1996>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>GREat Effects Development>GREat Effects Development>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>1.4>1 Player>Kang Fu is a standard, side-scrolling platformer. The player takes control over Klont, a kangaroo, who has travel to numerous levels while saving baby kangaroos and killing a boss at the end. Of course there are many enemies which decrease Klont's life bar when they manage to hit him. He can dispose of them by jumping on their heads or by using weapons which can be found during the levels: boomerangs, eggs, machine gun, bombs and boxing gloves. The player can circle through all collected weapons and most of them disappear after finishing a level. Other collectibles are the already mentioned babies and diamonds which reward extra lives and bombs when enough of them were gathered. Sometimes a hidden key has to be found in order to open a closed door. There are two easier difficulty levels which only give access to the first few levels. The graphics style is a mix between drawn graphics and digitized images.
Kid Chaos (Europe)>Kid Chaos>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Ocean Software Ltd.>Magnetic Fields (Software Design) Ltd.>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>3.8>1 Player>Kid Chaos is transported from the stone age into an unknown world by evil scientists from the future. Now he must fight his way through artificial environments such as the Secret Garden, Toxic Wasteland, Toy Factory, Techno Fortress, and the Ruined City to reach the time machine that can transport him back home.&#xA;Kid does this by running through the level, destroying all wildlife and several destruction targets, then leave the level by the exit door, which remain closed until Kid has destroyed all destruction targets. He destroys by swinging his club in the air and hitting them. He can also whiz if he's running fast, which enable him to discover hidden passages through walls that usually contain apples and power-ups. These are also found if Kid manages to jump really high in the air and lands on a platform that usually lead to secret passages.&#xA;There are five levels and four sections to complete in all of them (a total of twenty levels) and Kid start each level with three lives. During the level, if he loses health just by touching wildlife, or if the time expires, he is warped out of the level, loses a life, and has to restart the level at the checkpoints he passes through. His health can be restored either by waiting for the health meter to reach 99 (the boring way) or collecting apples (the smart way), but as Kid progresses further throughout the game, these apples become rare as well as his destruction targets.&#xA;Once he leaves a level, Kid is given a statistics screen, telling him the percentage of destruction he has caused, how much wildlife he has killed, how many apples he collected, and other extras. These "extras" probably include how much more of his destruction targets he broke beyond the requirement.&#xA;As mentioned earlier, if Kid jumps really high to reach a platform, he can get power-ups, giving him such wonderful things like extra lives, extra time, or extra health. He can also collect a life token. If he manages to find three life tokens within the same section, then he is awarded an extra life as well.&#xA;Every fourth level, Kid will be faced with a challenge, and the object of these is usually to kill something, but there's always a catch for these challenges. For example, in Toy Factory, he has to shoot teddy bears at least ten times to blow them up, while avoiding shooting at ducks; and in Techno Fortress, he's presented with a game similar to Space Invaders, but only this time, there are no barriers.&#xA;Kid Chaos starts off easily, but the further he progresses in the game, the higher the damage factor. Early in the game, he is allowed to hit so much wildlife before he loses a life, but as he progresses through each level, he can't afford to be hit not even once. Some levels in the game are quite tricky. Some levels require him to race through the level under a very strict time limit, while others contain a huge destruction target and he can't afford to miss any of these targets.&#xA;The game uses a password system, that allows you to resume at the start of each level. In terms of the gameplay, one of the cheats say it all.
Kingpin - Arcade Sports Bowling (Europe)>Kingpin - Arcade Sports Bowling>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Team17 Software Limited>Team17 Software Limited>Sports - Bowling>3.8>1 Player>Kingpin: Arcade Sports Bowling is a bowling game with support to 6 players, who can be human or CPU-controlled. Player statistics can be built up as you play&#xA;On the the bottom right of the bowling alley screen there is a power gauge that can be altered pressing the Up and Down keyboard arrow keys / joypad buttons. Pressing the Left and Right keys changes the position of your avatar, and hitting Enter / fire makes a small moving arrow appear in the bowling lane. It shows the direction your character will throw the ball when you hit Enter / fire again.
Lamborghini American Challenge (Europe)>Lamborghini American Challenge>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Paragon Publishing>Titus France SA>Racing - Cars>3.7>1-2 Players>Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and $6000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 divisions of racing through success on 60 racetracks across America. In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.&#xA;The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.&#xA;When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.&#xA;Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower; if a local wins you get your stake back.&#xA;Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.
Last Ninja 3 (Europe)>Last Ninja 3>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>System 3 Software, Ltd.>System 3 Software, Ltd.>Adventure - Arcade Isometric>3.6>1 Player>The third in the Last Ninja series sees you as Armakuni, the Last Ninja. He is drawn again into a battle with evil Shogun Kunitoki. The battle will take place among the temples of Tibet, the source of the Last Ninja's mystical strength. The Shogun intends to corrupt these Buddhist temples, to destroy the source of power for Armakuni and his emerging Ninja brotherhood. Armakuni must stop the Shogun's evil scheme.&#xA;The game retains the mix of martial arts combat (hand-to-hand and with various weapons), puzzles involving various objects you find on your way, and navigating your way around obstacles. However, it also introduces Bushido, necessary to complete each level. Bushido is earned by fighting honorably, by fighting enemies with the same weapon as them or in hand-to-hand combat, and not fleeing from a battle.&#xA;The levels correspond to the elements that combine to make up a Ninja's power, Earth, Water, Wind, Fire and Void.
Legends (Europe)>Legends>1996>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Guildhall Leisure Services Ltd.>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Adventure - Miscellaneous>4.1>1 Player>An alien race watched the wars on Earth as television shows. After a period of peace threatens the ratings, two alien scientists go back in time on various continents of the planet and start to deploy modern weaponry on them. When they return to the present, Earth is engulfed in chaos. A British scientist discovers the conspiracy and using his new invention, the soul transfer machine, sends a boy called Billy to be incarnated on a native of the different time periods.&#xA;Legends is an action-adventure with Zelda-inspired gameplay. The player controls a character pertinent to the time period (an American Indian from 1400 A.D. - America, a knight from medieval England, a Chinese warrior from Imperial China, an Egyptian acolyte from ancient Egypt, and Billy in the alien spaceship).&#xA;These characters collect objects and coins to buy items, weapons to fight the enemies and hearts to increase the health bar (located on the top-left of the screen). Pressing 1, 2 and 3 switches between the available weapons. Other characters provide clues and level objectives. Each epoch has bosses to be defeated and mini-games (for example, on the Chinese level there's a race on the Great Wall). After solving each time period, the game displays a password that can be entered at the start on the main screen. There is no form of saving progress while playing the main game.
Lemmings (Europe)>Lemmings>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Psygnosis Limited>DMA Design Limited>Brain - Puzzle>3.9>1 Player>Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.&#xA;You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.
Liberation - Captive II (Europe)>Liberation - Captive II>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Mindscape International Ltd.>Byte Engineers>Adventure - RPG 3D>3.5>1 Player>Liberation is the sequel to Captive, where the main character from the original is now a free man. However, your character is drawn into action once again after a political assassination and a corporate coverup by BioCorp, one of the ruling multinational companies. With aid from your four droids you are able to search the city for victims, those used in the coverups, of BioCorp. With each minor victory your intent becomes clearer - to persuade the Emperor in regaining control over the corporate hegemony. So Liberation is a very free-range game and, like Captive, you can buy better weapons, from swords to laser-rifles and enhance your droids with new equipment, e.g. numerous head-slots which plug in and give droids different abilities, ultimately driving you closer to the Emperor.
Litil Divil (Europe)>Litil Divil>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Gremlin Interactive Ltd.>Gremlin Ireland>Adventure - Miscellaneous>4.0>1 Player>Very nice action/adventure game for kids, as much as for the adult-kids. You are, as a game's name says, a little devil, in a real sense of word. The playing is either from the back view as you go wandering the tunnels and castles, or like an ordinary 2D adventure where you have to fight, jump or squash something.
Manchester United - Premier League Champions (Europe)>Manchester United - Premier League Champions>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Sports - Football/Soccer>3.5>1 Player>After Manchester United won the English League championship for the first time since 1967, it was no surprise that Krisalis re-used their existing license for a third licensed football game. Little did they know that the club was entering an unprecedented run of success that has continued well into the 2000s.&#xA;The basic control system will be familiar to anyone who's played a Kick Off game, as it involves holding fire to trap the ball under your player's foot, and releasing fire to pass, although the ball will be kicked onwards if it is moving fast when it comes to you. Other gameplay features include diving headers, variable pitch conditions, penalty shoot-outs and accurate deflections. 2500 players featured in the game all had a range of varied ability statistics, as well as different skin tones.&#xA;As well as individual matches and custom-created tournaments (which have much the same range of features as Sensible Soccer, plus full calculation of injury and suspension severities, including disciplinary points and differing injury lengths), you can play out a full season of matches for any club in England's top 5 divisions - all domestic league and cup matches are included, with promotions and relegations taking place after each season. The Tacti-Grid editor allows for advanced match tactics to be configured and experimented with.
Marvin's Marvellous Adventure (Europe)>Marvin's Marvellous Adventure>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>21st Century Entertainment Ltd.>Infernal Byte Systems>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>2.8>1 Player>One of the most console-style platformers ever seen on the Amiga, Marvin has approximately 60 levels to battle through. There are stars to collect, extra lives on offer, slides, tubes, ladders, caterpillars to move across, and bonus fruit to collect.&#xA;The levels are inhabited by typical enemies, some of which are killed by jumping on their heads, while others must be kicked or shot (once you collect a weapon).&#xA;Many of the annoyances which plague platform games, such as blind jumps and spikes appearing at random, are deliberately absent from this. The graphics are intentionally cute, using the AGA chip-set for 256 colours.
Mean Arenas (Europe)>Mean Arenas>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>International Computer Entertainment Ltd.>Nite Time Games>Arcade - Labyrinth/Maze>3.5>1 Player>You have entered a game show where you need to collect all gold coins scattered throughout the 22 arenas in order to enter the next one. There are four types of arenas: "Robo Zones", "Dungeon Zones", "Rainbow Zones", and "Starship Zones". Besides the gold coins, each arena is filled with monsters, hazards, and weapons which you must look out for. Use the map to help you locate these.&#xA;As you progress through the arenas, there are new challenges which you must face such as multi-level arenas, locked doors and passages, slippery surfaces, and much more. Also scattered throughout the arenas is the letter "B", which when collected will award you a letter that make up the word CREDIT. When you have formed the word, you will be awarded an extra credit. Besides the standard arenas, there are also speed arenas, which are more difficult than the others. The object of these arenas is to get past more obstacles and gather as many coins as you can before the time expires.&#xA;In each arena, you will receive messages from time to time, as well as a password, which you can enter to resume that game from that arena.
Microcosm (Europe)>Microcosm>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Psygnosis Limited>Psygnosis Limited>Shoot'em Up - Miscellaneous>3.0>1 Player>In the year 2051, two mega corporations battle it out for supremacy over an overcrowded, overpolluted planet. CyberTech Industries, the dominant company on the planet, is being challenged by Axiom, who blames the former for their president's death. To gain revenge, they secretly inject CyberTech's president, Anton Korsby, with a virus that threatens to take over his body, and ultimately destroy himself and CyberTech. Your mission is to enter Korsby's body, destroy the virus, and defeat the organism that controls his brain.&#xA;Microcosm is a 3D action shooter, similar to Descent, that takes place entirely within the human body. The concept was inspired by the 1966 movie Fantastic Voyage. The player pilots his way through various parts of the anatomy, blasting virii and enemy ships, while gaining power-ups and faster, stronger craft. The goal of the game is to eventually reach the brain to stop Grey M, the entity that controls Korsby's body.&#xA;Microcosm makes heavy use of full-motion video and features high-resolution fractal graphics (to simulate the walls of veins and arteries), digital music and sound effects.
Mitre Soccer Superstars (Europe)>Mitre Soccer Superstars>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Flair Software Ltd.>Flair Software Ltd.>Sports - Football/Soccer>1.3>1 Player>Soccer Superstars is a 2D side-scrolling football game in which the player can chose from 32 international teams to take part in either friendly games or cup tournaments. These can be played against the computer or both computer and a friend, however there is also a demo mode in which you will be able to see an entire tournament -or a friendly match- as a mere spectator. You are also free to modify team line-ups (all composed of real national player names), select basic formation systems, and alter the game length. The game interface is multi-language.
Morph (Europe)>Morph>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Adventure - Miscellaneous>3.6>1 Player>Young Morris Rolph has been trapped in limbo due to a malfunction on Dr Krankenpot's new teleport machine (how come characters with German-sounding names in computer games and films are always evil or stupid? Even Darth Vader sounds German.). Now he's been split into his 4 component parts, represented by liquid, gas, a hard ball and a bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels (36 on the special A1200 version - mirroring the game's plot-line of improved technology causing more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of the machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back to life.&#xA;The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by lots of points which can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can't progress.
Myth - History in the Making (Europe)>Myth - History in the Making>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>System 3 Software, Ltd.>System 3 Software, Ltd.>Shoot'em Up - Platformer>3.5>1 Player>In this platform game, you are a mere mortal who has been called by the Gods to defeat several mythological creatures that have been turned bad by the evil Dameron.&#xA;Myth: History in the Making is a platform game with a lot of fighting. The levels of this game deal with different mythologies, from ancient Greece to the Vikings, over to Valhalla (where none other than the hammer-wielding Thor awaits you), and more.&#xA;Apart from jumping from platform to platform, you'll also fight the enemies and bosses in your path with a variety of weapons - in the beginning you have only fists to defend yourself, but later you'll find more powerful weapons, such as swords and axes. There are many various types of enemies, different on every level. Typically, enemies keep appearing and coming at you from all sides, no matter how many of them you kill - so you have to keep moving.&#xA;Some obstacles in the game require not only brute force, but also a bit of thinking and puzzle-solving (and guesswork) to get past.
Naughty Ones (Europe)>Naughty Ones>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Interactivision A/S>Melon Dezign>Platformer - Single Screen>3.8>1 Player>The Naughty Ones come under your control in this old-fashioned platform game. Each screen is separate from the others, and involves trying to collect a key and then progress through the exit. Enemies are best dealt with by shooting one of your longer-range weapons towards them and waiting for it to hit them - this will release at least one coin, for points. Improved weapons can be collected, each of which functions for a limited number of shots. Bonus items are often located in the more precarious parts of the level, leading you to choose whether to risk losing a life, and going back to the start of the screen (although previously killed creatures remain dead when you lose a life)
Nick Faldos Championship Golf (Europe)>Nick Faldos Championship Golf>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Grandslam Video Ltd.>Arc Developments>Sports - Golf>3.7>1 Player>Arc Developments created a 3D game world called Reality3 for this simulation, licensed around one of Britain's top players. There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players.&#xA;The control system is quite unusual, as the strength of the shot is chosen before you start the swing, but you have to click within a range to activate the shot, and this range is narrower if your shot is intended to be more powerful. An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases the shot's power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough is harder to play out of than usual, as you can't make slight stance adjustments easily.
Nigel Mansell's World Championship (Europe)>Nigel Mansell's World Championship>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd.>Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd.>Racing - Cars>3.4>1 Player>Timing smiled on Gremlin with this licensed Formula 1 simulation, as Nigel's long quest for a championship had finally come good. The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.&#xA;Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices - pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.
Overkill & Lunar-C (Europe)>Overkill & Lunar-C>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Mindscape International Ltd.>Mindscape International Ltd.>Shoot'em Up - H-Scrolling>3.6>1-2 Players>This CD contains two shoot 'em ups. The games are:&#xA;1. Overkill - a Defender clone&#xA;2. Lunar-C&#xA;Lunar-C is unique in that it was only released in this compilation. The back story revolves around a giant dreadnought attacking an unnamed planet. The player takes the role of the chosen hero and boards their flying saucer to eliminate the aliens called Sirians.&#xA;The game is a horizontal scrolling shooter. After a wave of enemies is destroyed, they release a power-up token. Collecting it will advance the weapon select gauge by one step, similar to Gradius. In this way, the weapon systems of the player's ship can be upgraded. If the player hits an enemy or a bullet, their energy bar is reduced. At the end of each level, a guardian awaits that needs to be destroyed in order to advance further in the game.
PGA European Tour (Europe)>PGA European Tour>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Ocean Software Ltd.>Dome Software Developments, The>Sports - Golf>2.2>1-2 Players>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.&#xA;The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.&#xA;As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.

So, when the vegetables start attempting to run away from him, he has no choice but to chase after them.&#xA;Out To Lunch is a platform game set across 6 countries, starting off in Switzerland and finishing in Paris. To recollect the vegetables he must first stun them, either by firing at them or jumping on them, then walk over them, in a manner similar to Fire & Ice. Unusually, the game was converted from the SNES to the Amiga, not the other way around.
Pinball Fantasies (Europe)>Pinball Fantasies>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>21st Century Entertainment Ltd.>Digital Illusions CE AB>Arcade - Pinball>3.4>1-2 Players>After the success of Pinball Dreams on several systems, a sequel featuring four new tables was created. The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.
Pinball Illusions (Europe)>Pinball Illusions>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>21st Century Entertainment Ltd.>Digital Illusions CE AB>Arcade - Pinball>4.6>1-2 Players>Pinball Illusions is the successor to the Pinball Fantasies, using an upgraded game engine. The tables are Babewatch, Law & Justice, Extreme Sports and (on PC CD versions) The Vikings. These contain ramps, bonus areas and combo sequences to set up. All the artwork were produced in true 256 colors from the ground up for AGA Amigas and the PC, rather than originating in 32 colors on older Amigas.&#xA;New to this version is multiball: Pinball Illusions supports up to six balls simultaneously, in which case it switches to high resolution mode. CD versions use CD audio for music.
Pinball Prelude (Europe)>Pinball Prelude>1996>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Effigy Software>Effigy Software>Arcade - Pinball>2.5>1-2 Players>The central theme of the pinball game Pinball Prelude is time. The first table is set in the past and features a dinosaur setting, with table elements being not easily recognizable as such since they blend into the environment. The second table is set in the present and at the same time the most conventional of the three design-wise. The third table plays in the future and contains five flippers in total.&#xA;Some of the features include a hi-res mode for multi-ball, vertical and horizontal scrolling of the playfield and a rubber ball, which behaves much differently than the standard steel sphere.

In this platform game, your mission is to rescue from within the sets and backstage rooms they have been hidden in. Backstage sections are entered through doors, and weapons can often be collected in these.&#xA;The sets are themed around six different genres of film, and the backdrops, weapons and enemies fit these sections. There is a slapstick comedy played out in black and white (complete with greyscale background) a cartoon with lots of Road Runnering and goofy facial expressions, a Wild West romp, Sci-Fi complete with aliens, and so on. After each platform level you will have to pass through a film scene - piloting a runaway mine-cart, navigating a scrolling shoot 'em up level, or similar.

Poison gas fills the corridors, so the player has to act quickly before their oxygen supply runs out.&#xA;The game world is navigated in steps of pre-rendered video footage of corridors and halls. Players can use their map to help them navigate the labyrinth, finding rooms containing survivors. Occasionally, radio contact is made and mission objectives for the player will be updated for them to go to a specific location. After obtaining a gun, it is also possible to fight aliens, which are the source of the disturbance in the asteroid.

There are 4 front-firing options (guns, plasma, magma and laser-beams - guns can be built up quickly but lack top-end power compared to the others) as well as speed-up (only requires one token), side-shot, up to 3 homing missiles, build (a quick super-destructive blast that only functions when you aren't using auto-fire) and stealth (a period of invulnerability).&#xA;F17 Challenge: A third-person racing game featuring real Formula 1 cars and circuits, which represented Team 17's first attempt at the genre. There are two gameplay modes, Arcade and Normal - in Arcade mode you have to finish in the top 3 each time, whereas in Normal mode you accumulate the appropriate points, irrespective of one or two bad results. There are 3 difficulty levels, and the number of laps is variable. The field includes 22 cars (you can choose between a Ferrari, Williams, McLaren and Benetton), and contact with these (or with the kerbing or roadside barriers) inflicts damage on your car. This may get bad enough that you have to pit for repairs (if you don't make it to the pits and have more contact, you may get forced out altogether). Avoiding the slower cars you come up to lap can be crucial.

Quik The Thunder Rabbit (Europe)>Quik The Thunder Rabbit>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Titus France SA>Stywox>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>3.5>1 Player>This platform game has much in common with console games of the era. There are 4 worlds including ice, desert and fields, and have multiple routes through. The bad guys are cutesy. You get past them by spinning at them, although jumping over them is often sufficient. Power-ups on offer include speed ups, energy, food and water (Quik's thirst and hunger are measured separately). The bonus levels involve jumping through time, by finding the right doors.

Ryder Cup - Johnnie Walker (Europe)>Ryder Cup - Johnnie Walker>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Ocean Software Ltd.>Ocean Software Ltd.>Sports - Golf>3.0>1-4 Players>Ryder Cup: Johnnie Walker is a golf game based on the Ryder Cup tournament of 1993 which was played on the Belfry course. When on the field, the player has various icons available which are used to display or hide information, e.g. about the current hole and wind. The game offers two different control methods for the shot: two-click (choosing the loft from a menu and then clicking twice with the correct timing to select the power and drift) and the stroke method (after selecting the power, a miniature ball appears and the player has to click on it. The position of the click sets where the club hits the ball and therefore the drift). The latter is also available in a variant in which the ball randomly moves to make it harder.The tournament itself is a match between a European and US team with twelve athletes each. There is also the possibility to train the single holes instead of participating in the tournament.
Sabre Team (Europe)>Sabre Team>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Strategy - War>4.0>1 Player>A Sabre Team is a squad of four elite soldiers charged with some of the toughest hostage-rescue, building-storming and the like that Western forces have ever attempted. In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.&#xA;In each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.
Seek & Destroy (Europe)>Seek & Destroy>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Mindscape International Ltd.>Vision Software>Shoot'em Up - Multi-Directional>3.8>1-2 Players>Most of the fundamentals of this game work in a similar way to Desert Strike. You pilot a helicopter or a three-barreled tank through 14 increasingly tough multi-phase missions, each of which is preceded by a full briefing and a shopping phase.&#xA;Before each phase you can enter the shop and upgrade your weaponry, paying with golden medals gathered during previous phases. Your starting weapons are the chain gun and rockets/tank shells. Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle's weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper (which can only be done between phases, and some of them don't give you the choice), choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. All these preparations are surprisingly complex for a shooter like this, and a bad configuration can make the game really hard (no fuel in the middle of the desert, or a paper-thin armor are just two examples)&#xA;Missions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others. A scanner is installed into the vehicle to guide you, as is a mapping system and a limited shield.&#xA;Unusually, the game only scrolls vertically even though you have full directional movement. When you rotate the direction the ground moves underneath you, ensuring a more realistic effect and smartly mimicking motion effects.
Sensible Soccer - European Champions (Europe)>Sensible Soccer - European Champions>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Renegade Software>Sensible Software>Sports - Football/Soccer>2.3>1-2 Players>With the original Sensible Soccer having sold hugely, this updated version was released some months later (and then used as the basis for the later console versions). The teams are updated, with the sides present in the 92-93 European tournaments included, and the player names updated to take transfers into account.&#xA;The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one 'professional foul' (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.
Sensible Soccer - International Edition v1.2 (Europe)>Sensible Soccer - International Edition v1.2>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Renegade Software>Sensible Software>Sports - Football/Soccer>4.0>1-4 Players>Released alongside the 1994 World Cup, this was the first version of Sensible Soccer to feature teams from outside Europe. The World Cup tournament is featured in full, and you can adjust which 24 teams this features, a particularly crucial feature for English and French fans, as their nations failed to qualify. For the first time in the series an on-screen referee is featured. The club team data has been updated to take into account transfers and kit changes since the previous version. Gameplay is much the same as previous editions, being viewed from above with small sprites and loose ball control.
Shadow Fighter (Europe)>Shadow Fighter>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Gremlin Interactive Ltd.>NA.P.S. Team>Arcade - Beat'em Up>4.2>1-2 Players>Shadow Fighter was one of the few Mortal Kombat influenced beat 'em ups released for the Amiga. There are 16 fighters, each with their own home country and arena, plus Pupazz, a puppet you could repeatedly attack to practice moves. The usual sequence of best-of-3 fights is on offer, with variable difficulty and optional blood. The control system is designed around a one-button controller, but still offers 25 moves for each player, with special moves executed by spinning the joystick round 180 degrees. Each arena features multi-layer parallax, with up to 80 colors.
Simon The Sorcerer (Europe)>Simon The Sorcerer>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Blittersoft>Adventuresoft Ltd.>Adventure - Point and Click>1.6>1 Player>Simon is just an ordinary boy in an extra-ordinary world. A world in which he must rescue Calypso the Wizard by embarking on a long challenging quest.&#xA;The game is a point-and-click adventure, using a typical interface with words such as 'Use', 'Open', 'Walk To' (unlike Lucasarts' SCUMM games a simple click on that area of the screen won't do) and 'Pick Up' (again, a double-click on the item doesn't suffice - these two features extend game time significantly)&#xA;The game's plot has a number of references and spoofs to fantasy and fairy tales, with the Three Billy Goats Gruff involved in a particularly significant scene. The humor is very British in places, with lots of dry sarcasm, and lots of Simpsons-esque self-references to the fact that this is a computer game. The levels are non-linear in layout, with puzzles spread across the lands.

There are several full motion video sequences setting the story.&#xA;Pinball Fantasies: After the success of Pinball Dreams on several systems, a sequel featuring four new tables was created. The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.
Soccer Kid (Europe)>Soccer Kid>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Krisalis Software Ltd.>Sports - Football/Soccer>4.2>1 Player>Aliens attempting to steal the World Cup have crashed as they tried to flee, and the Cup has been broken, its pieces scattered around the globe. As Soccer Kid, you must retrieve it. During your journey you will visit Britain, Italy, Russia, Japan, and finally the States.&#xA;Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique elements. As the name implies, you have to kill your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks of keeping the ball in the air and under control are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks can be played with practice. You gain access to the pieces by collecting 11 Player Cards across each world.&#xA;There is a saving feature that gives you the ability to save between each country (but not between individual levels).
Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe (Europe)>Speedball 2 - Brutal Deluxe>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Renegade Software>Bitmap Brothers, The>Sports - Miscellaneous>2.1>1-2 Players>Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.&#xA;You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.&#xA;The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.&#xA;You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.&#xA;A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

During the course of the game, the player can decide which of the opposing forces to join. Both sides in the game feature very different crafts. The Gorenes has rather conventional crafts for solidly armed and armored crafts. The rebel side features some unusual weapons like disabler beam, cloaking device, and other special abilities. 
Striker (Europe)>Striker>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Gremlin Interactive Ltd.>Rage Software Ltd.>Sports - Football/Soccer>3.3>1 Player>The first game in the long-running soccer series, which stood out from the crowd with a unique forced perspective 3D view rather than a simple overhead one. The players are drawn large and there is a large scanner to assist with long passing. However, the standard mode has the ball sticking closely to the feet, which makes mazy runs upfield a more useful strategy. There are 64 international teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many different formations and strategies are offered.
Strip Pot (Europe)>Strip Pot>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Guildhall Leisure Services Ltd.>Pixel Blue>Gambling - Slot Machine>2.0>1 Player>An erotic variant of the classic "fruit machine" game.

Ocean is the next frontier, and war inevitably reached there. As an independent mercenary working for a corporate conglomerate, you are to pilot the latest fighter subs to protect the corporate interests, and rewarded with cold hard cash. With 5 different theater of operations (of varying difficulty) and an interesting mix of aerial and submarine tactics, this game can be described as Strike Commander under the sea, without the narrative.
Summer Olympix (Europe)>Summer Olympix>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Flair Software Ltd.>Flair Software Ltd.>Sports - Multi-Event>3.0>1-4 Players>This has a more humorous approach then most other games of this type, the characters and graphics have a lot of cartoon feeling.&#xA;There are 8 different events to compete in. Some are really easy if you fast on the buttons, like Swimming and 100 meter sprint. But others like Long jump, Javelin and Archery needs more technique then hammering on the buttons.&#xA;Also there is Skeet shooting, Boxing and Kayak events.
Super League Manager (Europe)>Super League Manager>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Audiogenic Software Ltd.>Audiogenic Software Ltd.>Sports - Football/Soccer>3.3>1 Player>This football management game is unique for two main reasons. Firstly, it's set in a completely fictitious game-world, with fantasy teams and players. You start off managing Folkford United, the worst team in the country, with players including Brian Evans, Nicky Moody and Bruce Roberts, and rival teams include Oldcastle, Marwick and Stoke Berry.&#xA;The second difference is the lack of statistics for player details. Instead, sentences such as 'best in defence, can also play in midfield. Has been playing reasonably well. Signed for £100,000 from Oldcastle 2 years ago. Current value around £150,000' are used, and its through playing matches and noting player ratings that you interpret how good a defender he is.&#xA;Another break with convention is an attempt at a human side, with players and fans communicating with you, offering advice, praise or semi-literate criticism.&#xA;The training feature is more complex than usual, requiring you to select 3 activities (from a selection such as passing, gym work and lap running) for each player each week - players will complain if they feel your selections are boring or unhelpful.&#xA;If you own either Emlyn Hughes' International Soccer (for the standard versions) or Wembley International Soccer (for the Amiga 1200 version) you can play around 1 match in 6, and watch all the others - otherwise you simply see a progressive score update, and can intervene with substitutions or tactical changes.
Super Methane Bros (Europe)>Super Methane Bros>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Apache Software Limited>Apache Software Limited>Platformer - Single Screen>3.7>1-2 Players>This platform game bares a similarity to Bubble Bobble in many ways. There are 100 single screen levels, featuring variously shaped ledges, for the two characters to face before escaping from the Tower of Time.&#xA;These levels are laden with nasty bugs, but you have a methane gun to shoot at them. This absorbs them, and allows them to be fired out against a wall; if they don't reach the wall, they live to fight another day. You must destroy them all within a specific time limit to progress.
Super Putty (Europe)>Super Putty>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>System 3 Software, Ltd.>System 3 Software, Ltd.>Platformer - Scrolling Screen>4.2>1 Player>Putty is a platform game where the lead character is... a blob of putty. He has been expelled from Putty Moon by Dazzledaze the wizard and his assistant Dweezil the Cat. Your job is to lead the character round the platform levels making use of his special abilities to rescue and destroy.&#xA;When moving, Putty has a natural bounce, and his eyes are loosely attached, moving after his body after falls (as a visual effect). He has many moves available - he can stretch himself to traverse larger gaps between (or move up/down) platforms, unleash a long-range punch, explode (which works like a smart bomb, clearing the screen of enemies) or flatten himself into a puddle on the floor (to absorb anything that walks over him).
Super Skidmarks (Europe)>Super Skidmarks>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Guildhall Leisure Services Ltd.>Acid Software>Racing - Cars>3.2>1-4 Players>A vague descendant of Super Sprint with a mass of features, and one of the last multi-format games to have roots on the Amiga.&#xA;A multitude of cars are available, ranging from F1 cars and Sportscars to Minis and VWs were on offer, with the option to have up to 8 of these on more powerful machines - with up to 3 different models of car. You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering.&#xA;24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.&#xA;The customizable nature of the game goes even further - the number of laps can be set, as can the colour and power of the cars. As you repeatedly race a track, the markings on the course are eroded by the cars running over them.

Each level in the game will have a given task to help in this, and you are allotted a number of characters who must accomplish the task. The player can switch from person to person while moving the characters around each scrolling puzzle, and teamwork is essential to success. Tasks can include finding objects (like a spear) on the screen, or trying to reach a specific destination which may require the use of objects you have discovered so far. Each level has a time limit, when time runs out the level can be restarted.&#xA;Humans 2 Available in both stand-alone and add-on forms, The Jurassic Levels is presumably named to cash in on the then-current Jurassic Park hype. It contains 80 additional levels for the Lemmings-influenced puzzler Evolution: Dino Dudes (known as The Humans in the UK). The objects collected during the first game are available from the start, so puzzles are immediately more complex.
The Labyrinth of Time (Europe)>The Labyrinth of Time>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Electronic Arts, Inc.>Terra Nova Development>Adventure - Miscellaneous>2.2>1 Player>King Minos has commissioned a labyrinth bridging time and space which will allow Minos to rule the earth.

The Lost Vikings (Europe)>The Lost Vikings>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Interplay Productions, Inc.>Silicon & Synapse, Inc.>Platformer - Scrolling Screen>3.2>1 Player>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.&#xA;The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.&#xA;The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.
The Misadventures Of Flink (Europe)>The Misadventures Of Flink>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Psygnosis Limited>Psygnosis Limited>Platformer - Scrolling Screen>3.7>1 Player>The Misadventures of Flink is a Jump'n Run set in the fantasy world of Imagica. The evil wizard Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and it is up to Flink, a wizard's apprentice, to set them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright.&#xA;Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the "recipes" which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more.&#xA;Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.

He is asked by the king to find out the whereabouts of the evil prince Gallus, overpower him, and bring him back to the king to serve his punishment for burning down the palace and murdering Kane the previous day. If Cho succeeds in his quest, the king will hand the throne over to him. Unfortunately, Cho doesn't have anything to start off with, so he must find some weapons and protection before he starts. Your quest begins in Sharma City, where the palace resides. You can talk to people to get some hints on what to do and where to go. Along the way you may find some weapons that can be found hidden in treasure cheats or are given to Cho. Some of these weapons include swords for killing enemies, and bombs for blowing up obstacles that get in your way. Some locations have teleports (one-way only) that will get you from one place to another, and you can reveal any hidden items by shooting any flora. 
Theme Park (Europe)>Theme Park>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Mindscape, Inc.>Bullfrog Productions, Ltd.>Strategy - Company>3.0>1 Player>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.&#xA;Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.&#xA;You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.&#xA;It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.
Thomas The Tank Engine's Pinball (Europe)>Thomas The Tank Engine's Pinball>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Alternative Software Ltd.>Spidersoft Limited>Arcade - Pinball>2.4>1-4 Players>Britt Alcroft's train-based characters (famously voiced by Ringo Starr) were brought to several computer games, and this is perhaps the most unusual, simplifying the game of pinball to aim it at younger players. Four different tables are included, based loosely around Thomas, James, Percy and Toby. Up to 8 players can take it in turns, and there are 3 skill levels and a high score table.&#xA;The tables vary in their complexity and difficulty; Thomas' is very basic in its design, while the others (especially Toby's) have more advanced ramps and combos. Full screen and scrolling view modes are available, and the game's feel is comparable to the Pinball Dreams series, which is unsurprising as Spidersoft did Pinball Mania themselves.
Top Gear 2 (Europe)>Top Gear 2>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Gremlin Interactive Ltd.>Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd.>Racing - Cars>4.0>1-2 Players>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver).&#xA;These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.&#xA;You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.
Total Carnage (Europe)>Total Carnage>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>International Computer Entertainment Ltd.>Bally Midway Manufacturing Co., Inc.>Shoot'em Up - Multi-Directional>1.7>1-2 Players>The war of 1999 left the country of Kookistan in shambles. Naturally, a dictator named General Akhboob took control of the beleagured nation and began creating an army of radioactive mutants. With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.&#xA;As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.
Trivial Pursuit - The CD32 Edition (Europe)>Trivial Pursuit - The CD32 Edition>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Domark Software, Inc.>Domark Software, Inc.|Oxford Digital Enterprises Ltd.>Board Games - Miscellaneous>3.5>1-2 Players>This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.&#xA;Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.&#xA;The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.&#xA;One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.
Trolls (Europe)>Trolls>1993>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Flair Software Ltd.>Flair Software Ltd.>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>3.2>1 Player>This platform game features the small blue-haired cutesy creatures that were popular around the time (although surely not with most computer game buyers?). You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop.&#xA;Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap.&#xA;Throughout the levels you will find the letters B,O,N,U,S and G released from bonus balloons or on killing an enemy - if at the end of a level your letters spell out Bonus or Bogus you go to the appropriate extra level. The former has a chance to gain extra lives, the latter must be escaped quickly to avoid losing a life.
UFO - Enemy Unknown (Europe)>UFO - Enemy Unknown>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>MicroProse Ltd.>MicroProse Ltd.>Strategy - Miscellaneous>4.3>1 Player>UFO Enemy Unknown is a strategy game featuring separate but interlinked elements. On the strategic side, called GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can't afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded, planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished, and so on.
Ultimate Body Blows (Europe)>Ultimate Body Blows>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Team17 Software Limited>Team17 Software Limited>Arcade - Beat'em Up>3.4>1-4 Players>A compilation of the original fighting game "Body Blows" and its sequel, available only for Amiga, "Body Blows Galactic". The game combines everything from its predecessors and adds more colors, improved graphics and music, more&#xA;backgrounds and endings, giving the player a total of 22 characters (including the invincible Max and his true self, the Terminator T17) and many fixes.
Ultimate Super Skidmarks (Europe)>Ultimate Super Skidmarks>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Acid Software>Acid Software>Racing - Cars>4.2>1-4 Players>This is the updated version of Super Skidmarks: A vague descendant of Super Sprint with a mass of features, and one of the last multi-format games to have roots on the Amiga. A multitude of cars are available, ranging from F1 cars and Sportscars to Minis and VWs were on offer, with the option to have up to 8 of these on more powerful machines - with up to 3 different models of car. You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering. 24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.

There you'll have to find the fabled lost star as well as a way to defeat the Golden King...&#xA;This is a classic old-style adventure game with a point&click interface. It uses the Rotoscope system to manage game characters and scores really beautiful 256-colour graphic.
Vital Light (Europe)>Vital Light>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Efecto Caos S.L.>Arcade - Logical Game>3.4>1 Player>Vital Light is one of those innovative games which only appear once a while. In this particular one, you have to control a small paint gun that contains five different colored paints, and destroy blocks that are falling toward you by making them all the same color. Your paint gun is on a roller at the bottom of the screen, and horizontal strips of colored blocks fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds. Holding down the fire button and pushing left or right changes the currently selected color, and sometimes you only just have enough time to get the right color before the blocks smash into you. As the blocks fall at varying speeds, there are times when an avalanche is set off by a slow block being hit by a fast moving block above it. This is a game that gets very, very frantic.
Wembley International Soccer (Europe)>Wembley International Soccer>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Audiogenic Software Ltd.>Audiogenic Software Ltd.>Sports - Football/Soccer>4.3>1-2 Players>Officially licensed by the old Wembley stadium, this football game is essentially an advanced version of Ocean's European Champions. Gameplay emphasizes one-touch passing, with a picture-in-picture window displayed when you prepare to play a long pass, which increases you chances of finding the target player. The AGA version was the first floppy-based game to supports a CD32 controller, making it easier to execute moves. 64 international teams are included, with the chance to play a full league competition or a World Cup. Full control over formation and tactics is offered before the match.
Wendetta 2175 (Europe)>Wendetta 2175>1996>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Skills>Vortex Design>Shoot'em Up - H-Scrolling>3.4>1-2 Players>In the year 2175, Earth has finally come to peace.

Some people on Earth managed to hide underground, in a technologically advanced factory. Two of them volunteered to fight the TERRONs with the help of spaceships that were built here.&#xA;Wendetta 2175 is a shoot 'em up game for one or two players.

Whizz (Europe)>Whizz>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Flair Software Ltd.>Flair Software Ltd.>Arcade - Labyrinth/Maze>3.2>1 Player>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren't always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you'd logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy -this reduces the significance of the points system.
Wild Cup Soccer (Europe)>Wild Cup Soccer>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Millennium Interactive Ltd.>Teque London Ltd.>Sports - Football/Soccer>3.2>1-2 Players>Following on from Brutal Sports Football came this interpretation of soccer, released alongside the 1994 World Cup. In one player mode you can play a Wild Cup or a League system; two player games are restricted to single 'Unfriendly' matches.&#xA;Unlike its predecessor the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because the original FIFA was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a 'Penalty Shoot Out', which involves going round shooting the opposition;- the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.

Worms (Europe)>Worms>1995>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Team17 Software Limited>Team17 Software Limited>Strategy - Miscellaneous>4.3>1-16 Players>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.&#xA;Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.&#xA;There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.&#xA;There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.

He is a Ninja in the 2345th dimension, 6 worlds each with 3 stages.&#xA;In this platformer, you can run, jump, climb walls and shoot the enemies. In the levels are also some power-ups for Zool. There are life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool. This "twin" makes all your motions a few seconds after you do.&#xA;In the options you can change the difficulty and the game-speed two times, the continues and the background music (Rock or Funk).
Zool 2 (Europe)>Zool 2>1994>ESRB - RP (Rating Pending)>Gremlin Interactive Ltd.>The Warp Factory>Arcade - Platformer (Scrolling Screen)>3.7>1-2 Players>The sequel to Zool sees him take on the bad guys Mental Block and Krool across 15 levels.&#xA;Zool 2 is a platform game where you control the titular "Ninja of the Nth Dimension" (or his girlfriend, Zooz, who can complete each level in a slightly different way) as he rampages through a variety of levels, collecting countless tasty treats, shooting any enemies that he encounters and finding bonuses (there's a variety of special power-ups Zool can find - for example, a bomb that follows him and can be blown up at any time to remove on-screen enemies, or a temporary invulnerability). New to the sequel is Zool's ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks.&#xA;On each level you have to collect a certain amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool's pet 2-headed dog.
