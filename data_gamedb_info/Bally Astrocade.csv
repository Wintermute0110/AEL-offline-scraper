Football (USA)>Football>1978>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Bally Midway>Dave Nutting Associates>Sports/Football>3.2>1-4 Players>Football is an early attempt at simulating the American sport. The game is played from a top-down perspective and features two unnamed teams, one blue and one yellow. When starting out the offense first gets to choose which of five plays to be used. After that the playing field will be displayed and after the ball has been snapped the player controls the quarterback with the joystick. By pressing the trigger a throw is made and the flight of the ball depends on the angle of the quarterback's arm which is controlled with the knob on the controller. After the pass has been made offense gains control of the ends by using the joystick. The defense uses the joystick to control the patterns of the cornerbacks. The ball carrier is considered tackled when making contact with any other player on the field.
Galactic Invasion (USA)>Galactic Invasion>1981>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Astrovision>Astro Home Arcade>Shooter>3.8>1-4 Players>Alien ships come at your missile launcher from every direction. They peel off from their formation singly or in groups of twos or threes. The more aliens you destroy, the more of their reinforcements attack. Each ship is piloted by a highly skilled captain capable of maneuvering with incredi- ble agility. Realistic sounds add to the intensity. Up to 4 players. 
Galaxian (USA)>Galaxian>1981>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Bally Midway>Bally Midway>Shooter>4.2>1-2 Players>Up to four players can compete in this home version of Namco's well-known Galaxian coin-op. Options include a choice of four levels of difficulty and the ability to set the number of cannons given to each participant. As most arcaders already know, Galaxian is a sort of "son of Space Invaders". Gamers move a laser cannon horizontally and fire upward at a swarm of insectoid creatures. Periodically, a trio of invaders peels off from the main body of attackers to sweep down and across the playfield, spraying the ground below with deadly bombs. The aliens are a lot easier to hit while they're still in formation, but better players will always withhold fire until some begin to swoop. An attack is worth twice as much when it is zapped in the midst of a dive-bombing run. Galactic Invasion's graphics are nice and colorful, but they don't quite match the artistic detail of the drawings used in the coin-op machine. The insects' wings, for example, are not visible in the home program. The play-value, however is outstanding. The pistol-grip design of the Astro Arcade controllers give players excellent control over on-screen movement. The action sets a blistering pace that packs all the excitement of the arcade original. A Strategy depends on a combination of the skill of the player and the level of difficulty selected. In the easier versions, better marksmen will definitely want to wait until the insects make their move before lifting a finger to take them out. At the higher difficulty settings, Galactic Invasion is just plain murderous. Deadly aliens streak across the screen to ram the defending cannon and are capable of dropping a dozen bombs in one pass. Only the top gunners should sit back and wait for the bugs to make the first move. If they so much as twitch, blast 'em immediately. Once a three-insect group begins a sweep, all but the super-shots are virtually assured of being one "life" down by the time the maneuver is completed. The aliens always break formation from the sides. Therefore, a wise arcader will begin to attack from either the extreme left or right side of the playfield. That way, you'll have a good chance to eliminate the invaders before they come barreling down the screen at your gun. Galactic Invasion is one of the first cartridges Astrovision has released since acquiring the Professional Arcade from Bally. It is exactly the kind of well-conceived entry that should get all home arcaders to sit up and take notice of the revived system.

Pirates Chase (USA)>Pirates Chase>1982>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Astrocade>Astrocade>Action>2.8>1-2 Players>Meet the game in the plain brown wrapper. Pirate's Chase is a two-player contest that may well prove highly habit-forming to videogamers. It really doesn't look like much, but its play mechanic certainly produces a bumper crop of close calls and thrilling confrontations.Using the joystick portion of the Astrocade controller, each player moves his on-screen symbol vertically, horizontally or diagonally across a rectangular playfield composed of regularly spaced dots. The result is something that might be called a maze-less gobble game, since passing over a dot removes it from the screen and adds its point value to the appropriate player's total. Periodically, special bonus prizes appear at random points on the screen (but always replacing an ordinary dot). These are generally worth 100 points multiplied by the level at which the game is then being played. After the combatants cycle through an array of trinkets and goodies, the game returns to the first bonus prize for another go-around.Besides racing against the other player to see who accumulates the greatest number of dots and bonus objects, both joystick wielders must always flee from the pirate. This nautical no-goodnik, symbolized by the traditional skull and crossbones, takes one of the player's precious lives whenever it catches up with the corresponding symbol on the playfield.The missing ingredient-- about the only one in an otherwise solid cartridge is the visual element. Pirate's Chase doesn't look all that attractive, though "plain" would be a better description than "ugly. Let's hope that Astrocade owners have the sense to look past the wrapping to see the gem buried inside.If electronic game-lovers are able to unshackle themselves from the prejudices of this intensely graphics-oriented period in the hobby, their reward will be a first-rate action contest. Its non-stop play routine, although admittedly somewhat repetitive in longer rounds, is positively riveting.One of the key factors which does the most to build excitement during play is the (intentionally imprecise) steering. It is really quite difficult to steer a straight course, much less make sharp turns. As a result, both players frequently end up circling a particularly juicy bonus object like flies buzzing around a pot of honey.As must be the case with any game that includes an open playfield and a merciless robot attacker, strategy is fairly fluid in Pirate's Chase.In general, the best advice is to make as few turns as possible when scooping up all of the dots and prizes. That golden scoring opportunity occurs when the pirate has caught the other player and your symbol is still active. This is the time to concentrate on hitting the bonus objective.Pirate's Chase's dull visuals not-withstanding, offers the rare chance to compete head to head"
Red Baron+Panzer Attack (USA)>Red Baron+Panzer Attack>1978>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Bally Midway>Dave Nutting Associates>Multiplay>3.7>1-4 Players>This cartridge consists of two war themed games: Red Baron and Panzer Attack. Both games are multiplayer only. Red Baron is played by two players while Panzer Attack can played by two to four players.&#xA;Red Baron is a dogfighting game played from a side perspective on a single screen.

Both can be played by one or two players.&#xA;Sea Wolf is a port of the arcade game with the same name.&#xA;Missile is based on the arcade game Guided Missile but differs in some ways. Like in the original game the aim is to shoot down targets (here only flying ones) with missiles but here the missiles do not descend back towards the ground after reaching the top. Instead the player here has to guide them on the way up. Another difference is that the player can move the missile base left and right before launching a missile.

Solar Conqueror (USA)>Solar Conqueror>1983>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Astrovision>Action Graphics, Inc.>Shooter>3.5>1-4 Players>Solar Conqueror is a top-down viewed shoot 'em up with multidirectional shooting and movement similar to Asteroids or Robotron. The war hungry DEMENS are threatening to wipe out the player's race with a radiation death ray and therefore the player has to conquer their solar systems.Each solar system consists of two or four planets and to conquer them all planets have to be defeated. In each screen a planet is located to the far right of the screen and from it various alien defenders will appear. To defeat the planet and move on to the next one the player has to kill all the enemies while avoiding getting hit by them. There are three different enemies: kamikaze combat ships, ground-to-air missiles and super fighting (killer) satellites. There are also asteroids floating around the planets that has to be avoided. Larger planets have stronger gravity which leads to the spaceship being harder control. The effect of the gravity increases as the ship gets closer to the planet.
Space Fortress (USA)>Space Fortress>1981>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Astrovision>Astro Home Arcade>Shooter>3.6>1 Player>Coin-op fans will instantly recognize this super fast-action arcade-style space shoot-'em-up as Midway's Space Zap. Gamers command a centrally located command fortress capable of firing in any of four directions-- North, East, South and West. From those respective positions at the top, bottom and sides of the playfield emerge alien laser-cannons and the occasional, free-flying mystery ship. As the contest commences, these enemy intrusions are infrequent, appearing at a leisurely pace and waiting a good while before actually firing. Once a cannon fires its laser torpedo, the missile can be detonated by a burst from the player's fortress, and a second blast will be required to eliminate the cannon itself. Graphics in this Bob Ogdon (of Dave Nutting Associates) creation are crisp and convincing, but it's primary claim as a space action classic is as the world's fastest home blast-'em-up sf videogame. Once the player has gotten the feel of the play mechanic, things really start jumping. The fortress is soon transformed into a whirling dervish of destruction, spinning crazily and spitting out flaming death. This is not the sort of game that arcaders will find themselves playing compulsively for hours. Wrists give out after about ten minutes of heavy duty action. Play sessions will be brief but intense. The most difficult obstacle players will encounter, aside from weakness of the flesh will be the UFO/mystery ship. Strategically, at all but the highest levels-- where it must be incinerated at the first opportunity-- play a waiting game. As in most space shoot-outs of a linear type (such as Space Invaders, Spacechase and Demon Attack) it's best to let the enemy come to you in preference to actively chasing after him. Sit patiently, but once the enemy strays into range, hesitate not. Perhaps the most manic space battle of all time, Space Fortress will leave you gasping. But you'll always come back for more.

Star Battle (USA)>Star Battle>1979>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Bally Midway>Dave Nutting Associates>Shooter>3.2>1-2 Players>Star Battle is a space shooter based on the trench run sequence from the original Star Wars movie. The game is for one or two players and involves a battle between an X-Wing and a Tie Fighter, although since it doesn't carry a license they are not called that. The X-Wing is controlled by player one while the Tie Fighter is controlled by player two or the computer. Before starting out a maximum score (1-999) is entered and the player that first reaches it wins the game. A single hit is enough to bring down the enemy ship and it is worth one point.The game is viewed from a third-person perspective with a pseudo 3D representation of the trench. The colour of the trench changes constantly to illustrate the forward motion of the fighters. By moving the joystick up or down the fighters accelerate or decelerate which means they move to the top of the screen and decreases in size or move to the bottom and get larger. If one moves closer to the camera the other gets further away and vice versa
Super Slope (USA)>Super Slope>1982>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Esoterica>Esoterica>Sports/Skiing>3.1>1 Player>In this one-player game, the player directs his skier downhill, avoiding pine trees and large rocks by using the joystick to ski left or right across the slope. A quick tap on the joystick increases the skier's direction from straight to slightly angled; another tap increases the angle further; and another tap will have the skier doing a traverse. The same holds true for either direction. Squeezing the trigger will increase the skier's speed.

Treasure Cove (USA)>Treasure Cove>1983>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Spectre Systems>Spectrecade>Adventure>4.2>1-4 Players>Treasure Cove is an action game that takes place off a small island in the Caribbean where the player has to dive into the ocean and search for the treasure of a lost Spanish galleon. The action takes place on a single screen and the player starts out in a small boat at the top of the screen. At the bottom there are several pieces of treasure that has to be retrieved (one at a time) but the ocean is also full of fishes and other sea creatures that have to be avoided. Any contact with these (including the smallest of fishes) will lead to an immediate loss of life. A life is also lost if the player runs out of oxygen which means it's necessary to plan ahead since it's not possible to go back to the boat (and recharge the oxygen) empty handed. With the press of a button the player can move quicker but at a higher cost of oxygen. After clearing all treasure from the cove the game will move on to a new location with more valuable treasure but also with more fishes. The game can be played by one to four players in hot seat. Before starting out the number of lives for each player can be chosen from one to nine. There is also a tournament level mode where each player has four divers. This mode was meant for players who wanted to mail their high score to the developer for high score verification.
