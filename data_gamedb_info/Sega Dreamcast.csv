That is where you come in...&#xA;Bang! Gunship Elite is an action game where you shoot a lot of enemies all by yourself, in the vein of Wing Commander or Freespace, but with the action turned up and tactics turned down. Add spectacular graphics, lots of "power-ups" (dropped by dead enemies or left in space by your supply ships), and you have a pretty good looking shooter. The game is mouse driven with keyboard inputs for things like speed and weapon selection. The plot is your typical "fight against all odds" story.

Boku no Tennis Jinsei (Japan)>Boku no Tennis Jinsei>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Bimboosoft>Bimboosoft>Sports/Tennis>2.8>1-4 Players>My Tennis Life in English is the work of the super small software house Bimboosoft (poor soft, as in no money) who also brought Dreamcast lovers the very nice Jetcoaster Dream 1 and 2. Boku No Tennis Jinsei isn't really what I'd call a premium tennis game such as Power Smash or even games such as the classic Super Tennis or Family Tennis on the Super Famicom. The problem with this game is that the collision detection seems to be off at times meaning that you can actually hit the ball even though you can clearly see that your racket didn't touch it. Add the fact that it's pretty tough to judge distance and you have yourself one dodgy tennis game. Still, it does have a charm that makes it worth picking up if you can find it cheap enough. The problem is that you probably won't find it cheap enough since this was never really released in great numbers making it quite a tough one to find these days

Weapon upgrades are based on collectible power-ups, but the game mostly relies on a power bar that fills as you destroy enemies and which allows you to unleash your super weapon at the expense of decreased normal firepower. The game also features a unique "border" system which involves three separate routes through each stage. You select the default route at the start of a level and when your ship is destroyed you get knocked down to the next "border", which features alternate backgrounds and enemy patterns. Only if you get knocked off the last border you lose the game.&#xA;Uses completely polygonal graphics and features single player arcade, remix and practice modes through 6 enemy-infested stages, the last of which has four unique variations.

Player VS. CPU has two different modes: Story mode sees a story unfold as you defeat each CPU character (and changes depending on the character you start with) and Win Contest is a simple "how many games can I win in a row" against the computer.

The game system is centered around "grooves" which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character's abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove. The "EO" of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove: Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character's moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases..

Chu Chu Rocket! (USA)>Chu Chu Rocket!>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Sonic Team>Strategy>3.9>1-4 Players>ChuChu Rocket is an action puzzler, designed predominantly as a multi-player game. You have indirect control over mice, and must guide them to the safety of a rocket, and away from a cat. You do this by placing arrows on the ground, which they will follow. The multi-player game is a frantic all-against-all duel, in which each player's mice will only follow instructions of their own colour. You can play this mode on your own against CPU opponents, or take on a series of predefined puzzles
Cleopatra Fortune (Japan)>Cleopatra Fortune>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Altron>Altron Corporation>Puzzle>2.9>1-2 Players>Cleopatra Fortune is a falling-block puzzle converted from the 1996 Taito coin-op and featuring a cutesy anime Egyptian theme. Groups of stones and gems of different shapes fall from the top of a well. Gems can be cleared by enclosing them within a group of stones, and stones can be cleared by making complete rows from them. Blocks will fall when those under them are cleared, which can create chains for more points.&#xA;The game includes three different play modes. First is a standard endless mode where play continues until the player is overwhelmed by the blocks. Second is a versus mode for two players. Last is a puzzle mode where the player is given a set field, a set sequence of drops, and a specific goal such as clearing all the gems or achieving a chain of a certain length. The puzzle mode has the player rescuing Cleopatra's friends who have been trapped in a pyramid by the evil Sphinx.
Coaster Works (USA)>Coaster Works>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Xicat Interactive>Bimboosoft>Strategy>3.4>1 Player>Coaster Works puts the player in the role of a roller coaster engineer, recently hired to help construct several different roller coasters for different amusement parks.&#xA;The construction part is set up with a screen divided in four camera angles and a grid based building tool. Using vector pieces, the player has to make a roller coaster that meets the requirements of the specific park. The pieces can be tilted, elevated, lowered and turned to make sure the ride is as exciting as possible.&#xA;After the roller coaster is done it will be tested with a crash test dummy (who's also able to squeal like an excited kid), to make sure it meets such requirements as safety, speed, excitement etc. This is done in a 1st person view, allowing the player to come along for the ride as well.&#xA;There are 6 different stages, each with different sizes and limitations.
Confidential Mission (USA)>Confidential Mission>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>Hitmaker>Gun>3.5>1-2 Players>Confidential Mission is a light-gun compatible shooting game most easily likened to Sega's Virtua Cop series. You play as either Howard Gibson or Jean Clifford, both super-agents a la James Bond, and you are taken through scenarios shooting enemies and attempting to avoid civilian casualties.&#xA;The game is a home version of the coin operated arcade machine, and is playable by one or two players. The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series "Justice Shot" (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the "Combo Shot" in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire. The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.
Conflict Zone - Modern War Strategy (USA)>Conflict Zone - Modern War Strategy>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Ubisoft>MASA Group>Strategy>4.1>1 Player>Conflict Zone is a modern-day war game with 3D graphics. Your every move is being watched by the media so you'll have to act right to make a good impression (rescue civilians,..). The impression you make will also determine how much money you will get for your missions, so there is no resource management.
Cool Cool Toon (Japan)>Cool Cool Toon>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SNK>SNK>Rhythm>3.9>1-2 Players>An unusual game for SNK since they are renowned for their 2D fighting games. Cool Cool Toon at first glance seems nothing more than a cash in on the popular (at the time) rhythm games. But at a closer look you'll see it's got it's own unique style that to be honest isn't exactly the best system out there. The game is tricky to play due to the positioning of the buttons that you have to do using the analogue controller and at times impossible to judge what is the next button to press. But it's not all bad. The graphics are ok but I think Samba De Amigo is much better looking. The music is a mix bag from poor to great songs but they all have a very interesting why of changing depending upon your skill level, a bit like NiGHTS on the Saturn.
Cosmic Smash (Japan)>Cosmic Smash>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Sega Rosso>Sports>3.2>1 Player>Cosmic Smash for Dreamcast is a port of the Sega Rosso arcade game. It is a futuristic sports game, a mix of squash and Breakout.&#xA;The player controls a semi-transparent human male in third-person view. The goal is to clear each level from a set of different blocks at the far end of the room within a given time limit. Additional time is given at the start of the next level depending on how well the player did. To clear the room, the player has to hit a ball with a racket at the correct angle. The ball bounces back from the blocks and walls. The blocks have different properties, for example, some have to be hit multiple times before they disappear, while others move around thus making them harder to hit.&#xA;Besides the regular shot, the player can also perform a trick shot, which in combination with other moves gives extra points when successfully executed. At the end of each level, a map with branching paths is displayed, enabling the player to take different routes towards the end of the game.
Crazy Taxi (USA)>Crazy Taxi>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>Hitmaker>Driving>4.4>1 Player>Crazy Taxi is an arcade-like racer where the player takes the role of a taxi driver who weaves his way through crowded streets, across sidewalks and even under water, in a wild and frantic race to deliver passengers on time. The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.&#xA;In the main Arcade mode there is a timer that quickly runs down. It can be replenished by picking up customers. While driving reckless maneuvers are encouraged. Players can disregard all traffic rules and customers give extra tips for speedy and dangerous driving, but these can only be cashed when the customer arrives at his destination in time. By the same token the reward at the end of a ride is based on the amount of time left, as each customer also has a personal timer. The city is filled with slopes and jumps, and the game uses a very loose driving model. No damage can be done to the car, so driving as fast as possible is encouraged. While driving players can toy with the gears to perform two special tricks: a crazy drift and a crazy boost to speed up more quickly.&#xA;Next to the Arcade mode there is an Original mode, and Crazy Box where specific goals need to be met on closed down courses. In the regular modes it is possible to disregard the usual timer and play for a fixed amount of minutes. At the end of the race the player is rewarded with a license, either D, C, B or A, with S for an outstanding performance. Next to the interactive courses from the arcade version there is a new course for home consoles. There are four cabs and drivers to choose from. The cars have different statistics and the drivers different attitudes while racing. The game has a soundtrack featuring The Offspring and Bad Religion (not for the Xbox 360 version).
Crazy Taxi 2 (USA)>Crazy Taxi 2>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>Hitmaker>Driving>3.9>1 Player>The sequel to the smash hit Crazy Taxi puts you in the drivers seat once again with 4 new drivers to choose from, and a brand new city to wreck havoc with, New York City.&#xA;In Crazy Taxi, you crashed your taxi through the streets as fast as possible, making money by performing stunts and picking up/dropping off passengers to certain destinations. For Crazy Taxi 2, you can pick up more then one passenger at a time, meaning more money faster, new stunts including the 'hop', which allows you to hop over buildings and take the quick route past the traffic, and plenty of mini games, such as Crazy Golf.

The government that funded his research wrote the whole affair off as a loss, which made it all the more upsetting when reports of Dr. Kirk's good health and nearly finished research came in. A special forces team is sent to the doctor's private island laboratory to extract him and his research, but they are totally unprepared for some of the side effects of his developments. Side effects that come from 100 million years in the past.&#xA;Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find "plugs" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors.

Power-ups can be collected to increase the bomb and life stock or enhance the main gun's fire power.&#xA;Scoring works by using the Reflect Force to repel enemy shots. Once the shots hit an enemy, medals appear in their place. When these are collected, the score multiplier increases.&#xA;There are two game modes, arcade and score attack. Arcade plays just like the original coin-op game, and score attack lets the player choose a stage and fight for the highest score there. In this mode, the player has unlimited lives, however the score multiplier will reset once the player dies or uses a bomb.

Any monsters present in these areas will be shown walking around. Walking over to and touching the monster in any way will activate a battle. If the monster notices the player approaching it is considered a normal battle, if Ryudo is able to approach undetected the player's party will gain the initiative in battle, if any party member besides Ryudo is approached by the enemy then the party loses initiative.&#xA;In battle, each character is able to choose from a list of actions that include "attack combos" (standard attack command), Special Abilities/Magic, "Critical Strike", Guard, Evade and Escape. Critical Strikes are weaker versions of attack combos with the advantage that they can block an enemy's action. This partly depends on the positions of the character on the action bar, displayed at the bottom of the screen, which shows each character (and enemy's) time to act within the battle. Some magic spells and special abilities are also able to block enemy actions, though they take longer to perform than normal attacks. Both combo attacks and critical attacks require the attacker to run up to the enemy in order to perform the action. This depends heavily on the character's individual movement as well as other characters acting as obstacles on the screen. Successfully defeating enemies in battle awards experience points, power points, magic points, gold and items.

Because gears had no will of their own and could only obey humans. Only one gear, named Justice, was able to transfer his will onto other gears and to rebel against the humans. In year 2180, Justice was killed as a result of a bloody tournament organized by the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. Yet recently, a new gear was discovered. He showed no signs of hostility, yet he had no master and was roaming about free. It was impossible to capture or to kill him because he was immensely strong.

GunLord (World)>GunLord>2012>ESRB - T (Teen)>NG:Dev.Team>NG:DEV.TEAM>Platform>4.1>1 Player>After the space pilot Vanessa Gaiden defeated the Evil Empire in the events of the game Last Hope, she got missing on her way back and wasn't heard of anymore. Vanessa's husband, Gordian Gaiden, sets out to search for her. Meanwhile, a new evil has appeared in the galaxy: a planet lord called "The Master", who can create and control evil beings made of steel, and uses his power to terrorize the galaxy. On his search, Gordian comes across the evil presence of The Master and sets out in his Gunlord suit for the planet Kairos II. Gunlord is a mixture of platforming and run & gun gameplay in the spirit of Turrican. This includes exploring large and highly branched levels in search for items, bonus, power-ups and the exit. The game mechanics are very similar, with an assortment of weapons, which can be upgraded by finding power-ups, but only being able to have one main weapon. Gordian is also able to form a ball to move through narrow passages or attack. Additional weapons are a limited amount of smart bombs (huge energy swipes across the screen) and flexible beam, which uses up (self-restoring) energy.

At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma.

Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection.&#xA;Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination.

What that "fictional" means is that great liberties have been taken with the historical accuracy of the world and events. The most obvious point is that although most planes come from real World War 2 aircraft, the theatre of operations is a bit unique; The four major sides to the conflict (American, British, German, Japanese) are all fighting one another over a group of islands somewhere in the Pacific. Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another.&#xA;The gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British.

This is the story about the GG's, one of three rival teenage gangs who ride motorised inline skates and are tagging the streets with graffiti. There is a turf war going on between the gangs GG's, the Poison Jam, and the high-tech freaks, the Noise Tanks. The evil Rokkaku Corporation has the corrupt police in their grasp, and, headed by Captain Onishima, the cops are hell-bent on subduing the unruly teen protagonists.

King of Fighters 2000 (Japan)>King of Fighters 2000>2002>ESRB - T (Teen)>Playmore>SNK Corporation>Fighter>3.4>1-2 Players>The final King of Fighters game released by SNK in its original state, The King of Fighters 2000 expands on the story and gameplay presented in The King of Fighters '99. This year's tournament is sponsored by the Ikari Warriors in an attempt to discover more about the NESTS organization, and to derail the plans of potential NESTS agents K' and Maxima. Not everything is as straight-forward as it usually is, however, and even the Ikari Warriors themselves are at risk of being betrayed from within by the end of the tournament.&#xA;The King of Fighters 2000 features a roster of 34 fighters plus 2 unlockable boss characters. The four-man teams and the striker system introduced during the previous year return in this year's tournament, with the striker system itself receiving significant improvement. One change in particular is the "alternate" striker system, where every fighter in the game now has another character linked to him or her that may be chosen instead of the normal character for striking purposes. For example, one may elect to use Iori Yagami's alternate striker instead of using Iori himself; in his case, the player could elect to choose and use his old teammates Mature and Vice for striker duty instead. Some characters also have hidden "maniac" striker with strange (but potentially useful) abilities.

Counting the new characters (May Lee, Angel, K9999, Original Zero, Igniz) and returning fighters (such as Heidern and Goro Daimon), The King of Fighters 2001 has 40 normal characters and 2 boss characters to choose from. In terms of gameplay, the system used in The King of Fighters 2000 remains more or less unchanged with the exception of the striker system, which has been redeveloped since that last KOF release. The number of strikers you may have is now fully customizable; you can have as many as 3 characters assigned as strikers and one as a fighter, or assign all 4 of your characters as active fighters. The number of strikers and fighters can be changed after each battle. In addition, the amount of power you can store for special maneuvers and Desperation Moves increases with each character assigned as a striker. A fully active fighting team has only one Power Stock to play with, while a team that is striker-dedicated (save for the single fighter) can access up to four Power Stocks.

Surviving is obviously not easy...&#xA;The game is played from an isometric perspective in front of detailed prerendered backgrounds. As you are an animal the game doesn't have any ingame texts - for solving riddles you are totally dependent on experimentation and careful observation of the environment.

Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss. There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...&#xA;Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate. Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.&#xA;The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.

Moho (Europe)>Moho>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Take-Two Interactive>Lost Toys>Action>2.2>1-2 Players>The universe is made up of human and synthetic lifeforms. Synthetic lifeforms are considered second class citizens by their human counterparts. The story takes place on the prison planet Alpha Prime, a world completely designed for the holding of criminals. You are a synthetic lifeform sentenced for an eternity for a crime you didn't commit and in order to earn your freedom, you must compete against other prisoners in competitions in 10 different incarceration facilities.

There are seven different events to compete in which are Pursuit, Last Man Rolling, Race, King of the Hill, Run the Gauntlet, Tag, and Powerball that pit you not only against your fellow inmates and guards, but against the levels themselves. Run the gauntlet charges you with making it to a goal point within a time limit, all the while avoiding other warriors and obstacles such as flame throwers, spikes, and gun turrets. Pursuit is identical, but it adds the challenge of the arena crumbling away. Powerball has you collecting balls throughout the arena and throwing them at a goalpost before time runs out. Tag has you collecting a set number of tokens that have been scattered throughout the arena within a set time limit.

Musapey's Choco Marker (Japan)>Musapey's Choco Marker>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Ecole>Ecole>Puzzle>4.0>1-2 Players>Don't be put off by the pretty awful cover, Musapey's Choco Maker is actually a pretty addictive puzzler coming to beloved Dreamcast straight from the Naomi arcade original. Musapey's is probably best described as a marsupial like creature. In a typical one-player game your marsupial is dropped onto the playing field, a collection of various colored cubes with a special cube called 'boss' at the center of the mess. Your creature freely walks six sides of the playfield using a block it stands upon (you lay these blocks down with a press of a button) eliminating other blocks/rows to clear the playfield leaving only the boss block remaining. A time limit adds another layer of challenge. Eliminating blocks is simple, it's akin to a sandwich, say you have a yellow block, plop a red block at one end of the block and do the same at the other end (R,Y,R), the entire row will disappear. In addition any loose blocks hanging on that row will disappear as well. These extra blocks will add a few seconds back to the clock, quite handy. The game doesn't dictate the length of a row but the more blocks you eliminate the more your bomb gauge fills which yields a block that wipes out blocks in a set radius. Using gravity to take out multiple rows and gray blocks that have to transformed to be removed add another facet to the gameplay, elevating the simple premise into a deep game.

Netto de Tennis (Japan)>Netto de Tennis>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Capcom>Capcom>Sports/Tennis>4.6>1-4 Players>Although being another tennis title for the Dreamcast, Net De Tennis differs to Sega's Virtua or Power Smash Tennis series, not just visually but also in the way it plays. Unlike Sega's title, there is not so much focus on reaction and speed in Net De Tennis. Instead the crux of the gameplay is based on strategy and the ability to outwit your opponent and while it makes the game feel more realistic than its graphics initially lets on, it also takes away a little of the arcade fun. The speed also can feel a little bit sluggish at time, so set up plays feel infinitely more considered. Controls are tight, with just one button for a lob shot and another for regular shot but each shot can be swerved depending on how you move the control, essentially give you a more deeper control system than at first meets the eye.

The game includes play-by-play commentary by L.A. Kings announcer Bob Miller.
Nightmare Creatures II (USA)>Nightmare Creatures II>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Konami>Kalisto Entertainment SA>Adventure>4.0>1 Player>Adam Crowley, from the original Nightmare Creatures, is back to unleashing creatures in London.

Omikron - The Nomad Soul (USA)>Omikron - The Nomad Soul>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Eidos Interactive>Quantic Dream SA>Adventure>3.5>1 Player>You are the Nomad Soul, a computer game player sucked into another dimension. At first you take on the role of Kay'l, an Omikron police officer. As Kay'l you must figure out what has happened over the past few days due to memory loss. As the game progresses you will find a plot that twists and turns at every corner. For transportation, you use a "Slider" that you can control manually or set to auto-pilot to take you throughout much of Omikron. When given a choice of what to say to a person, your answers will almost always affect your future in the game and how people act towards you.&#xA;Throughout the course of the game you may take on the role of up to 41 different characters through the use of a "Soul Transfer" spell. In most situations, even if you die, you will be "virtually" reincarnated through the next character that touches you. In your travels you must explore the vast city of Omikron. You may visit anywhere in the city that you wish to, even if it isn't important for finishing the game.&#xA;An example of this freedom is when in the "red light" district of Omikron, you find a flyer about a "prohibited" concert that you may attend. If you go to the concert, the band will play a full length song for you. Also in this part of Omikron you can attend "peep-shows" and go visit the sex shops. All items are kept inside your SNEAK device on your wrist, 18 items may be carried at once and there is a transfer system set up so items can be stored and retrived at another station.&#xA;Also, in Omikron, it is important that with each character you take them through combat training so you are at a higher fighting level. Although most of the game takes place in adventure mode there are two other modes available to use at certain points throughtout the game, shooting and fighting. In the fighting mode, your character knows a variety of moves and will have to fight off his opposition. In the shooting mode, you find yourself in a first-person perspective shooting after thugs mostly, although you will run into some more interesting enemies to shoot later in the game.&#xA;As they say in Omikron, "Who will you be after you die?"
Ooga Booga (USA)>Ooga Booga>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Visual Concepts Entertainment, Inc.>Action>4.6>1-4 Players>Ooga Booga takes place on a set of mystical islands in the tropics.

Your goal is to defend against terrorist attacks.&#xA;You can select one of four predefined players, which differ in speed, armor and weapons, or you can create a customized character. The game itself doesn't provide any storyline, instead you can choose one of the three modes: Arcade, Mission or Versus. In all modes you find yourself in one of several small arenas after starting the game. Usually your goal is to kill a certain amount of terrorists in a limited time (or your friends in Versus mode).&#xA;The gameplay is similar to Quake 3 Arena, especially in regards to game speed and the (configurable) key assignment of the controller.

Plasma Sword - Nightmare of Bilstein (USA)>Plasma Sword - Nightmare of Bilstein>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Fighter>3.5>1-2 Players>Plasma Sword - Nightmare of Bilstein is the successor of Star Gladiator released for Playstation. Like it's predecessor it was first released on Arcade before ported to the Dreamcast.&#xA;The game features 22 anime-like Characters in a 3-dimensional futuristic world - except for the backgrounds and the menus, which are plain 2D-bitmaps without a lot of movement. The stages are unlimited in all directions, so it's not possible to fall of the edge. The speciality of this game are the so called "plasma moves", visually very appealing special moves filling the complete screen which can be executed when you have collected enough "plasma power". Despite of the 22 characters there are only 11 different move layouts, as one layout is shared by two characters.
Plus Plum (Japan)>Plus Plum>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Takuhiro>Takuhiro>Puzzle>3.6>1-2 Players>Plus Plumbs is another one of those match 3 coloured balls together type puzzle games. With this title however there's a nice little twist. You see, your playing area is some sort of scale so not only do you have to worry about your balls hitting the top but also the other player doing well enough to push his half of the scales down and your half up. If that wasn't enough to worry about you also have to remember that your balls will change colour once a combination has been preformed. Of course the colour changing is always the same such as a red ball will change to a green ball and so on.
POD - Speedzone (USA)>POD - Speedzone>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Ubisoft>Ubi Soft SRL>Driving>3.5>1-4 Players>POD SpeedZone is the sequel to the original POD for the PC. It is a simple, futuristic racer, where you are able to attack your opponents. You are a miner on the colony of Damethra, and an alien virus has taken over the cars on the colony, creating mutant cars. It was one of the first games playable on SegaNet, and one of the only games to support the Dreamcast Broadband Adaptor. This game features eight different vehicles to use on five 3D tracks.
Power Stone (USA)>Power Stone>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Fighter>4.0>1-2 Players>The creators of Street Fighter add a new dimension to 3D fighting. In Power Stone, 2 fighters take to multi-level arenas with Power Stones and other weapons lying around for use.&#xA;Each game contains Power Stones. When you have enough stones (between three to five), your character transforms into an almost unbeatable warrior, with an all-new range of moves (although this does not last for long).
Power Stone 2 (USA)>Power Stone 2>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Fighter>3.9>1-4 Players>Power Stone 2 adds heaps of new characters and environments to the already established crew, however there are now 4 players doing battle at a time in both single and multiplayer modes.&#xA;This time, the top 2 from every round (in other words the two that survive each fight of 4 players) progress to the next round. And after a few rounds, you will battle it out with huge Bosses that take up most of the screen.&#xA;There are plenty of new power-ups that litter each arena (including guns, hammers, extra power stones and plenty more). You can also hop into a gun turret for extra blasting fun. And of course, the Power Stones are available to use.
Prince of Persia - Arabian Nights (USA)>Prince of Persia - Arabian Nights>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Mattel>Avalanche Software LLC>Platform>3.0>1 Player>The Sultan of Persia and his son-in-law are visiting the Sultan's brother, Assan. The friendly family meeting soon turns into a nightmare: Assan kills the young Prince's bodyguards, locks him up in a prison, and captures the Sultan. The reason is a little disagreement between the brothers regarding matrimonial arrangements: it appears that the Sultan had promised his daughter to Assan's son, Rugnor, and later broke his promise by letting her marry the Prince. In the resulting turmoil, the Sultan is killed, and the Princess is kidnapped by Rugnor, a ruthless half-tiger creature. The Prince must figure out a way to find Rugnor, defeat him, and rescue his wife. Prince of Persia 3D is just what its title implies: an action platformer with puzzle-solving elements in the style of the previous Prince of Persia games, but set in a three-dimensional environment. The Prince still has to time his jumps, avoid deadly traps, interact with the environment, and fight Rugnor's minions who will try to stop him.
Pro Pinball Trilogy (Europe)>Pro Pinball Trilogy>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Empire Interactive>Cunning Developments>Pool and Dart>4.4>1-4 Players>This compilation contains the following three tables of Empire's Pro Pinball series:&#xA;1.

Project Justice (USA)>Project Justice>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Fighter>3.8>1-4 Players>Project Justice is the sequel to Shiritsu Justice Gakuen: Nekketsu Seishun Nikki 2. It once more thrusts you into the shoes of a team of students, trying to find out what is causing all the bizarre events.&#xA;Players pick a school to fight for and smash their way through the other schools, questioning them until you find out what is happening. The gameplay is very similar in style to the original Rival Schools, featuring bombastic special moves and team-up attacks, along with the same, highly caricatured students.
Psychic Force 2012 (USA)>Psychic Force 2012>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Acclaim>Taito Corporation>Fighter>3.4>1-2 Players>Psychic Force 2012, the sequel to Psychic Force, is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.&#xA;Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.&#xA;The later PlayStation port, renamed to Psychic Force 2, adds the 3 missing characters from the first game (Genma, Brad and Sonia), the psy-expand mode where the player can play a series of special battles to learn other character attacks, and an anime intro video replacing the original in-game intro. It also lowers the overall difficulty of the CPU fighters and makes some control adjustments (for instance the shield can now optionally be enabled with a single button). Of course, the graphics were notably degraded.
Psyvariar 2 - The Will to Fabricate (Japan)>Psyvariar 2 - The Will to Fabricate>2004>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Success>Skonec>Shoot-'Em-Up>4.1>1 Player>Psyvariar 2 is another specimen of the recent breed of "newschool" arcade shoot'em'ups (other examples being Ikaruga and Border Down). As many other recently released shoot'em'ups, it combines basic arcade shooter gameplay with modern 3D graphics to liven up the genre. The level backgrounds as well as all enemies are modeled in full 3D, with the action taking place in a vertically scrolling two-dimensional plane which moves through the level.&#xA;As most of the other new-style SHMUPs, Psyvariar 2 has a gimmick: getting close to enemies or shots without actually being hit is called "buzzing" and yields massive extra score. In addition, the player ship's rate of fire is rather slow by default and can be raised by shaking the ship left and right a few times and then keeping moving horizontally - as soon as the horizontal movement stops, the fire rate drops down to normal again.&#xA;As in most other of the new Japanese style of shoot'em'ups, there are usually an extremely high number of enemy shots on the screen. All these factors combine to make learning precise control a central part of the game.
Puyo Puyo 4 (Japan)>Puyo Puyo 4>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Compile>Puzzle>4.2>1-4 Players>Puyo Puyo~n (also called Puyo Puyo 4, based on a Japanese playword), is the fourth installment of the Puyo Puyo puzzle-game series.&#xA;It features a single player story mode, where the main character (Arle) encounters different characters in their specific locations, and engages them in a Puyo Puyo puzzle battle.&#xA;Other modes allows up to 4 players to battle.

The main characters of the series decide to take a break from all the spellcasting and puyo catching by competing against each other in a series of dance-offs.&#xA;Each player receives a sequence of controller motions and tries to perform said sequence matching the graphic and audio cues that play out. Success increases your health bar, but if you fail you run the risk of getting beaten by your opponent.&#xA;Graphics are completely 3D for the first time in a Puyo Puyo game, featuring fully polygonal models of each character as they dance in sync with the music, composed of an assorted variety of J-Pop tunes.
Puyo Puyo Fever (Japan)>Puyo Puyo Fever>2004>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>MileStone Inc>Puzzle>3.9>1-2 Players>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!&#xA;A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.&#xA;When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.&#xA;Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.
Q-Bert (USA)>Q-Bert>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Hasbro Interactive>Pipedream Interactive, Inc.>Action>3.0>1-2 Players>The hip character from the 1980's returns in a new, 3D puzzle adventure. This time, you must help Q*bert save his friends, while solving all of the detailed 3D level that are part of 4 unique worlds, while avoiding the bad guys at the same time. And that's no easy task. Powerups litter the levels, while warp points can get you out of all those sticky situations.
Quake III Arena (USA)>Quake III Arena>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Sega>id Software, Inc.>Shooter>3.7>1-4 Players>The third game in the Quake series is a departure from the previous games, focusing exclusively on multiplayer arena fighting with no story-driven singleplayer part - directly competing with Epic Games that did the same with the contemporary Unreal Tournament.&#xA;The offline part takes the player through a number of one-on-one and team-based challenges against AI-controlled opponents, slowly ranking upwards in difficulty, as the character of the player's choosing. Compared to the previous titles, the colours and general design of the game are much brighter and it shakes off the dominant shades of brown and grey the previous titles in the series were known for. The player's arsenal consists of new and familiar, but redesigned weapons, including a gauntlet (melee attacks) and a machine gun as the spawn weapons, a shotgun, plasma gun, lightning gun, rocket launcher, railgun and BFG. Each weapon has specific advantages, ranging from the amount of damage to reloading times and the ability to hit-scan opponents.&#xA;The different arenas are also filled with health bubbles, complete sets of armour and armour shards, the well-known Quad Damage power-up, ammunition, and specials such as Mega Health, Haste, Invisibility, a powerful Battlesuit, and more. As with the other Quake games, it is known for its freedom in movement. Advanced players using techniques such as rocket jumping, strafing and circle jumping to quickly get around areas. The game offers more speed than Quake 2, but it is not as fast as the original Quake. Not everything was kept - the double jumping from the previous titles was removed for instance, but replaced with new tricks.&#xA;The singleplayer part only serves as a diversion for the online multiplayer options, with modes such as duel, team deathmatch (TDM), capture the flag (CTF) and more. As with Quake II, the vanilla version of the game was eventually heavily tweaked by the players' community with all-new tournament features (including voting, referees, banning, netcode updates), as it was used in professional Pro Gaming tournaments for almost ten years.
Radirgy (Japan)>Radirgy>2006>ESRB - E (Everyone)>MileStone Inc.>MileStone Inc.>Shoot-'Em-Up>3.9>1 Player>Radirgy is a vertical-screen top-down bullet-hell shooter originally developed by Milestone for Naomi arcade system and later released on Dreamcast.&#xA;Setting itself apart from many other top-down shooters on the system, the game features bright, cartoony, cell-shaded graphics. At the beginning, the player is given a choice of three different mecha-ships - one with a spread-gun, a weak homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun. Additionally, each ship can use a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can't be killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the player lets go of the fire button, and a smart-bomb-like field that can be extended around the player in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing their shots and turning them into points.

Rainbow Cotton (Japan)>Rainbow Cotton>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Success>Success Corp.>Shoot-'Em-Up>2.8>1 Player>Another shooter in the Cotton saga. Trouble brews in the homeland of Cotton's long time friend Silk, as the evil demon Suede steals the legendary Willow candy from the queen's castle. Seeing as how no one can face Suede and his forces Silk drafts Cotton in order to restore peace to her land, but she may have forgotten that Cotton is a big fan of Willow candies herself...&#xA;Gameplay-wise Rainbow Cotton actually follows in the steps of Panorama Cotton as the gameplay switches from a 2D perspective to a 3rd person one. The gameplay itself however is reminiscent of games like Panzer Dragoon, in which you don't control Cotton as she flies, but instead where she aims with her magic spells. You can shoot down enemies as well as open chests, doors and other bonus locations for power-ups and spells, which advance Cotton's abilities in an rpg-lite fashion and increase your arsenal with different magical powers.&#xA;Taking advantage of the technological advances, the game uses for the first time polygonal graphics and to complement the action the game features 2D animated cutscenes between levels.
Rayman 2 - The Great Escape (USA)>Rayman 2 - The Great Escape>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Ubisoft>Ubi Soft Entertainment Software>Platform>4.1>1-4 Players>A gang of pirates have invaded Rayman's world to seize its unique creatures and sell them to an intergalactic circus.

By completing an objective on all 3 areas, you unlock a sky fortress level in which you can rescue a new skater to control.&#xA;Gameplay is based heavily on the Tony Hawk series of games. Tricks consist of button and direction presses, and can be strung together with grinds to create high-scoring combos.
Re-Volt (USA)>Re-Volt>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim>Acclaim Studios London>Driving>3.5>1-4 Players>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live!&#xA;Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from.&#xA;There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places.&#xA;In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.

It seems that the evil goddess Kardis is about to be resurrected by her faithful servants. The only way to stop them is to gather famous heroes from Lodoss War universe and to defeat the evil ones in a battle.&#xA;Record of Lodoss War is quite similar to Diablo gameplay-wise. It is an action RPG which is heavily combat-oriented. You can directly control only the main hero, while the legendary heroes who join him on the quest are controlled by the AI. As you go through the game you level up, tweak your items with the great Ancients system, and gain new spells. It is also possible to froge weapons and to imbue them with runes.

Reel Fishing - Wild (USA)>Reel Fishing - Wild>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Natsume>West One>Fishing/Sports>3.8>1 Player>Reel Fishing: Wild is a Dreamcast-exclusive entry in the fishing simulation series. It allows players to catch two dozen species of fish in 14 different locations all over the world, from Japan to North and South America to Oceania. The Dreamcast fishing rod controller is supported for realistic castings and reel-ins. The game starts in the fishing lodge, where players can check out a fish glossary, their catch list and their stock of lures, reels and lines and rods. Going for a round of fishing is done via the fishing notebook, which presents players with a series of challenges. At the start, only one location - a Japanese mountain stream - is unlocked. To unlock others, a certain number of a particular species must be caught. Catching fish not only opens up new locations, but also gives access to new types of lures, reels and lines, and rods, which in turn allow more successful fishing. A fishing session begins with a photo-realistic first-person view of the location created through combining digitized images with some animation, like for a waterfall or swaying trees, as well as disturbances of the water surface that hint at the best places for casting. Once the line is cast and a fish moves near the lure, the view switches to a 3D underwater view, showing fish, line, and hook in close-up. Baiting, setting the hook, and reeling in the catch are then done in this view.
Resident Evil 2 (USA) (Disc 1)>Resident Evil 2 Disk 1>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Capcom>Capcom Production Studio 3>Adventure>4.0>1 Player>Like the previous game in the series, Resident Evil 2 is a 3D action-adventure using three-dimensional polygon characters over two-dimensional pre-rendered backgrounds, with the action viewed through a variety of cinematic fixed camera angles in each room. Just like the original Resident Evil, players can choose to play as one of two possible characters. Each character goes through the same initial scenario, but with differences in the type of weaponry they find and the people they meet along the way. Leon will team up with a mysterious woman calling herself Ada Wong, while Claire will find herself charged with protecting a little girl named Sherry Birkin. Unlike the original Resident Evil, beating the game for the first time unlocks a second scenario to be played with the character you didn't choose, with new locations, maps, enemies, a longer and more climactic ending. Your actions in the first scenario can also affect the outcome of certain events in the second scenario. Additionally ammo and healing items are more plentiful than in the original game, although you still aren't given enough bullets to kill every enemy you meet.

Resident Evil 3 - Nemesis (USA)>Resident Evil 3 - Nemesis>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Adventure>3.7>1 Player>So Evil they even gave it a subtitle!&#xA;The final installment of the Resident Evil series for the Playstation, Resident Evil 3 takes place during the events of Resident Evil 2. The midwestern town of Raccoon City is in ruins, having been overrun with the undead creating T-virus thanks to the wacky hijinks of William Birkin and Umbrella Inc. As Jill "master of unlocking" Valentine (one of the two main protagonists of the original Resident Evil), you must find a way out of the zombie-infested remains of the city alive. Along the way, you'll interact with and receive help from three heavily armed Umbrella mercenaries who have also become stranded in Raccoon City thanks to the incompetence of their employer. Standing in the way of your group's last escape are a horde of flesh-eating zombified citizens, homicidal mutants, and a relentless killing machine known only as Nemesis who is determined to hunt down and kill the survivors of the original Resident Evil, including Jill.&#xA;A dramatic improvement over Tyrant/Mr. X/G from the previous games, Nemesis possesses the same maneuverability as Jill allowing him to run (faster than you, in fact), use firearms (such as a rocket launcher), dodge attacks, and even move through doors and from room to room in pursuit of Jill. On top of that he still possesses the nigh indestructibility we've come to know and... well, know from Umbrella's ultimate bio-weapons.&#xA;Like its two predecessors Resident Evil 3 is a third-person action-adventure game with polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds with cinematic camera angles, a technique originally pioneered by Alone in the Dark. Although the game uses the same basic engine and gameplay as the previous games, improvements include auto-targeting, a 180 degree spin, and a new dodge move that allows you to avoid enemy attacks by pressing a button a second before they strike. Another addition is Jill's ability to create different kinds of ammunition by mixing together three different types of gunpowder found throughout the game. Compared to Resident Evil 2, the amount of available ammunition and healing items has been significantly decreased, making the game more difficult. The variety of zombie citizens has also been made more diverse.&#xA;The number of polygons in the character models has also been increased, along with the possible screen resolution and color depth for the PC version (up to 1600 X 1200 at 32 bits, from a maximum of 640 X 480 at 16 bits for Resident Evil 2). Another welcome addition in the PC version is the ability to skip cutscenes as well as the door loading animation.&#xA;The PC and Dreamcast versions includes all eight of Jill's possible costumes, as well as the mercenary mini-game Operation Mad Jackal which allows you to play as one of the three Umbrella soldiers. On the Playstation version, these special features must be unlocked by beating the game with a high score.

She infiltrates Umbrella Corporation's headquarters in Paris, where she is captured and knocked out. When she comes to, she finds herself in a prison on a remote island. Freed by a friendly guard, Claire faces several problems. Not only is the island under attack by an unknown assailant, but there has been another outbreak of the T-Virus and the island is crawling with zombies and other mutated creatures. Claire not only has to face the undead, but also the commander of the base, a mad aristocrat with family ties to the origins of Umbrella Corporation and the T-Virus. And escaping from the island is only the beginning of Claire's ordeals.&#xA;Code: Veronica continues the survival horror gameplay of its predecessors: the protagonist explores the surroundings, fighting monsters and solving puzzles. However, Code: Veronica is the first game in the series to do away with pre-rendered backgrounds, using a fully polygonal 3D engine instead, which allows for features such as real-time lighting and camera movement. Still, such movements are only used sparingly, and the use of perspective is mostly unchanged from earlier installments: the camera automatically switches to different static angles, showing protagonist, monsters and rooms from different spooky viewpoints.&#xA;Most of the weapons from the earlier games make return appearances: knife, handguns, shotgun, grenade launcher and crossbow are all featured. There are also new weapons including a sniper rifle, an AK-47 and several guns only found in pairs, which can be used to target two enemies at the same time. Several weapons upgrades can also be found.&#xA;Similar to the earlier games, the player will not only control Claire, but also two other characters: Claire's fellow prisoner Steve, and her brother Chris.

Samba de Amigo (USA)>Samba de Amigo>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Sonic Team>Rhythm>3.7>1-2 Players>Samba De Amigo is a highly unique game: a maracas simulation. Game play is based around a special maracas controller that you use to interact with the music. The controller senses which region in space out of a possible 6 that the maracas are in. It also senses when the player shakes the maracas. As the music plays, the player must shake the maracas in the appropriate region with proper timing to progress. A standard controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately.&#xA;The music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources. Some of the songs are traditional samba music, while others are recognizable pop tunes, like "Macarena" and "Tequila.

However, a lot more has been added than in most updates. A new hustle mode of play complements the original mode and the song list has almost been doubled, with many new songs such as Vamos de Carnaval, the theme from Rocky and even the Wedding March being included. For anyone who thought they had the original game mastered, there's even a survival mode where you have to play through all 43 songs making a maximum of 8 mistakes in total. The core gameplay effectively remains the same as the original though. This game was only released in Japan.

Sega Bass Fishing 2 (USA)>Sega Bass Fishing 2>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Wow Entertainment, Inc.>Fishing/Sports>4.0>1 Player>SEGA Bass Fishing 2 is the obvious sequel to SEGA Bass Fishing. Like the previous game in the series this simulation game allows the player to fish for bass on various lakes. At the start of the game the player can pick one of various characters. Each character has his or her own stats such as casting distance, which makes them all unique. Each character's appearance can be altered by the player as well.&#xA;Using sonar the player can cruise around the lake until he find a good fishing spot. Besides the location the player can also pick the month, time of day and weather in which he wants to fish. All these factors are calculated when it comes to determining what kind of fish he or she is likely to catch. To aid the player there's 100 different kinds of lures to fish with.&#xA;The game is meant to be played with the special fishing rod controller.&#xA;There are two game modes: free fishing and tournament mode.

Sega Rally Championship 2 (USA)>Sega Rally Championship 2>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Sega AM9 R&D Division>Driving>3.9>1-2 Players>Sega Rally 2 is the sequel to Sega's hit arcade game, Sega Rally. This game, like it's predecessor, is based on Rally racing. Rally racing is unique in that races take place on both race tracks and off-road courses. The courses in this game reflect this nicely. Some take place in the desert or forest, others take place in cities.&#xA;The cars in this game are all actual rally cars, with manufacturers from Europe and Japan both well represented. You do not get to see very many of them at one time, however, since rally races are typically time-based events. In this game, you are not competing directly against the other cars, you simply have to have the best time through the course. So, during any race you will usually see a handful of other cars on the track.&#xA;Sega Rally 2 contains several modes of play. The first mode is the simple arcade mode of play. Here, you race in 4 courses, one right after another. The second mode is the 10 year championship. In this mode you race on 16 courses, and can make modifications to your car between races. Finally, there is a 2-person split screen mode for head-to-head competition.
Sega Smash Pack Volume 1 (USA)>Sega Smash Pack Volume 1>2001>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>SEGA of America Dreamcast, Inc.>Miscellaneous>3.5>1-2 Players>Sega Smash Pack: Volume One was the first, and ultimately the only collection of classic Sega games released for the Dreamcast. It contains only some games in common with the PC Sega Smash Pack and Smash Pack 2 so is an iteration of the concept rather than a port of that collection.&#xA;This collections features ten emulated Genesis/Mega Drive titles. These games are Altered Beast, Columns, Golden Axe, Phantasy Star II, Shining Force, Vectorman, Revenge of Shinobi, Sonic the Hedgehog, Streets of Rage 2 and Wrestle War. This was the first American release of Wrestle War.&#xA;It also included two games that had been previous released for Dreamcast: Sega Swirl, which had been given away on various discs and Virtua Cop 2, which had been previously available for Dreamcast only in Japan.
Sega Swirl (USA)>Sega Swirl>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Tremor Entertainment>Action>3.7>1-2 Players>In an interesting publicity maneuver for their newly-released Dreamcast video game system, Sega of America released a free game for the PC and DC platforms, Sega Swirl. (Also apparently to capitalize on the DC's logo, a Cinnabon-like swirl.)&#xA;The object of the game is simple. A screen fills with multi-colored swirls, and then you must remove the whole screen. A swirl removed will also remove all neighboring swirls of the same color. Gravity affects the remaining swirls, and the whole mass contracts to the left of the screen as you remove more and more.&#xA;Scoring is based on "combos", or number of swirls removed simultaneously. Obviously, more swirls=higher points, but single swirls actually remove points. You have to play a balancing act between removing huge masses of swirls and being left with non-matching sets, or removing smaller sets and possibly missing out on a huge combo score.&#xA;In a foreshadowing of the (hoped for) coming day of PC/video game on-line convergence, PC and DC owners can play against each other- via e-mail.&#xA;PC owners can download the game for free, and Sega offers it in two varieties- the standard version, and (refreshingly) a small sound-free version for people who don't want to be online for a long time. A separate soundpack is available for those who opt to not get the whole set in one fell swoop. DC owners can get the game free on various promo GD-ROMs Sega has distributed.
Sega Tetris (Japan)>Sega Tetris>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Wow Entertainment>Puzzle>3.8>1-2 Players>Sega Tetris is an officially licensed Tetris game originally made for arcades that can be played in both single player and multi player modes. The game uses polygonal graphics with animated backgrounds. As progress through the game is made these change and take the player to numerous different settings. When playing alone the game is very much true to the original Tetris but with some differences. The game is played with a joystick for moving the blocks around as they fall and two buttons to rotate them left and right. As the game's level is raised the speed of the falling block will also increase and since it's an arcade game it will reach a high pace relatively early. One addition to the game is a slot machine and the symbol it stops on depends on the number of lines cleared. By matching all the three wheels the player will get a large bonus. The two player versus mode adds special attacks to the gameplay and these are activated by clearing lines. Clearing two lines will lead to a joint attack where two stuck together blocks will fall while clearing three lines will lead to a long block falling. By creating a tetris (clearing four lines) stacked lines will rise from the bottom of the playfield. Some attacks come from clearing multiple lines that are apart from each other. This includes a missile attack that destroys block and a K.O. attack that knocks out the opponent preventing him from controlling the blocks for a short while. There is also a four player mode where two cabinets are connected. On the Dreamcast version the multiplayer mode can be played online.

Any details Ryu learns are written down in his notebook for future review. Ryu can buy items from stores or try his luck with capsule toy machines, but the vast majority of items you can buy have no purpose outside of filling out your inventory screen. Ryu can also visit an arcade and play arcade accurate versions of Hang-On and Space Harrier as well as games like darts and pool.&#xA;Ryu is a trained martial artist, and while a true martial artist knows it is better to avoid a fight, sometimes it is still necessary. Ryu can train his moves, either by repeatedly doing them while training, or by sparing with his friend Fuku-san. Fighting plays like a simplified Virtua Fighter game, although with toned down air juggling. Ryu's training also gives him heightened reflexes, and sometimes during a cutscene the player will have only a moment to press a button (displayed onscreen) to get Ryu out of danger.

Silent Scope (USA)>Silent Scope>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Konami>Konami Co., Ltd.>Shooter>4.2>1 Player>This coin-op conversion doesn't have a sniper rifle light gun, but all the scoping action is still here.&#xA;The aim of the game is to save the captured family of the President of the USA, by sniping all on-coming enemies as you go along.&#xA;As an enemy appears, an area of the screen zooms in, allowing you to easily pick off the guy in the head. Once done, press a button to zoom out, so as to choose your next target.

Slave Zero (USA)>Slave Zero>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Infogrames>Accolade, Inc.>Action>3.1>1-4 Players>500 years in the future, man and machine are virtually one and the greatest megacity in the world is locked in brutal war. You are the ultimate saboteur and part of an elite fighting force. Your mission: steal the largest, most sophisticated biomechanical attack weapon ever designed.. and kick some serious ass.
Sno-Cross Championship Racing (USA)>Sno-Cross Championship Racing>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Crave>UDS>Driving>3.6>1-2 Players>Strap on your goggles and helmet, choose your favorite Yamaha sled, and hit the courses. Gain experience day and night, sun rain or snow, racing on the icy flats of Vladivostok, the slopes of Aspen, and the tunnels of Nagano.&#xA;But, the real challenge starts when you enter the race circuit. Start with the 500cc sleds, win races, upgrade your snowmobile, and unlock higher end sleds and new courses.. And, if you're looking for even more challenges, race head-to-head with your friends, go vertical on hill-climbing tracks, or create your own courses with the included track editor.&#xA;The PC conversion has a higher polygon count, higher resolution on the textures, and more accurate physics.
Soldier of Fortune (USA)>Soldier of Fortune>2001>ESRB - M (Mature)>Crave>Raven Software Corporation>Action>3.8>1 Player>A terrorist organization has stolen nuclear weapons from a facility in Russia, intending to sell them to various third-world nations, initiating a global conflict. The player takes the role of John Mullins, a US mercenary working for an organization known as "The Shop". The goal is simple: hunt the villains across the globe, thwart their evil plans, and save the world!&#xA;Like most 3D shooters, Soldier of Fortune consists mainly of exploring the environments and killing the enemies that try to impede the player's progress. It is one of the first shooters to isolate over 20 different body regions and show/inflict damage to those regions. For example, if the player character shoots an enemy in the foot, the enemy will limp. The game was also notable for including realistic gore animations resulting from the injuries sustained by the enemies.
Sonic Adventure (USA)>Sonic Adventure>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Sonic Team>Platform>4.0>1 Player>Yet again Sonic and friends find themselves wrapped up in the schemes of Dr. Robotnik. This time he plans to exploit the power of Chaos, a malevolent being that feeds upon the power of the Chaos Emeralds. In their own ways five heroes will do what they can to save Station Square and, perhaps, the entire world.&#xA;The player can select from which character to play after meeting them with Sonic, and each has their own unique version of each level. Sonic's levels involve racing through a level as quickly as possible, destroying any robots along the way. Tails can hover over distances, and his levels are similar to Sonic's except that he must beat an opponent to the finish line. Amy can't charge up ramps or run as quickly as Sonic and Tails, but she does have a giant hammer she can break obstacles with. The goal of her levels is to avoid being captured by a robot sent after her by Dr. Robotnik. E102 Gamma is a slow, difficult to maneuver robot, but it has guns and missiles that can lock on to several targets at once, chaining together attacks and earning a higher score and more time on the clock. The goal of its levels is to reach a boss enemy and destroy it before time runs out. The final character is Big the Cat, a fisherman searching for his lost frog. Big's levels are almost entirely devoid of action or fighting; he just fishes. Each character can find items that increase their abilities as the story progresses, such as a ring for Sonic that lets him home along lines of rings, or improved lures for Big. A final chapter wrapping up the story is unlocked after all other characters have been completed.&#xA;Additionally each of the characters can visit the Chao garden where they can raise baby Chaos. By petting, feeding, and showing animals found in levels to the Chaos they can grow stronger, and optionally be put into races against other Chaos. As well each level in the game has additional objectives that can be completed to acquire extra emblems, although the emblems don't do anything in this version of the game. Finally at one time it was possible to go online and download additional levels and bonuses in the game, such a Christmas theme for Station Square and a level sponsored by AT&amp;T, but since SegaNet shut down this is no longer possible.
Sonic Adventure 2 (USA)>Sonic Adventure 2>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>SEGA Studios USA>Platform>3.9>1-2 Players>Sonic has returned! This time, his nemesis Dr. Eggman has teamed up with Shadow, a dark hedgehog with a mysterious past, and is aiming once again (like he doesn't) to rule the entire world with the power of the Chaos Emeralds! It's up to Sonic and his friends to stop Eggman and put him out of business for good!&#xA;With new features such as a story line told from the view of both the good guys and the villains, greater speed, and an improved A-Life system, Sonic Adventure 2 is poised to be Sonic's greatest and most dangerous mission yet!

Sonic Shuffle (USA)>Sonic Shuffle>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Hudson Soft Company, Ltd.>Action>3.5>1-4 Players>Much like Mario Party and Crash Bash, Sonic Shuffle has Sonic and his team playing a board game style tournament, where mini-games are at every turn.&#xA;Each character has a group of cards with a number on each. On every turn the player chooses a card to determine how many steps to take. When all of the cards have been used the deck is reshuffled, and each player gets a new hand. While a player can see only the numbers on their own cards, and not the numbers on other players' cards, they can still choose the cards of another player.&#xA;Each board has certain tiles: blue adds 3 rings to your total; red removes 3 rings from your total and special tiles which places all of the players into a min-game or event.&#xA;The aim of the game, at the end of it all, is to get the Precioustone (1 per board).
Soul Calibur (USA)>Soul Calibur>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Namco>Project Soul>Fighter>4.1>1-2 Players>A fighting game to end all fighting games. A sequel to Soul Blade, Soul Calibur takes place in a time inspired by a mixture of 16th-century ancient China and oriental medieval fantasies and legends.&#xA;All characters have weapons and distinct fighting styles with over 100 individual moves per character. In addition to high, mid, and low attacks, characters can hold/throw, block, and perform special attacks -- one or more of which is deemed "un-blockable" and must be avoided by ducking, jumping, or rotating around your attacker.&#xA;In addition to several locales in which to fight and alternate models/costumes per character, the Dreamcast conversion of Soul Calibur contains many additional features over the arcade coin-op, including hidden characters and locales, a campaign mode, and tournament mode. There is also a "museum" where you can view character profiles and view motion-captured martial arts demonstrations.
Soul Fighter (USA)>Soul Fighter>1999>ESRB - T (Teen)>Mindscape Inc.>Toka S.a.r.l.>Beat-'Em-Up>2.6>1 Player>Pick the warrior, thief, or wizard, and fight through five huge levels, each with its own boss. Your main weapons are your fists, but you can pull out weapons for quick kills. You only get so many shots with your weapon before it breaks, though.&#xA;Gameplay is basic 3D brawling. You will be attacked by one or more enemies, and will need to defend yourself, and attack back. The game features arcade and adventure modes. In the arcade mode, the levels are timed, and you only get 5 lives but you are revived where you died. In adventure mode, you get unlimited retries of each level, but must complete each level on a single life.&#xA;Note that your objective in each level is to kill every enemy; since the levels have multiple paths, you will need to backtrack often.
South Park - Chef's Luv Shack (USA)>South Park - Chef's Luv Shack>1999>ESRB - M (Mature)>Acclaim>Acclaim Studios Austin>Game Show>2.9>1-4 Players>Chef hosts this Acclaim title, which mixes South Park trivia with mini games in the mold of Mario Party (Nintendo 64). The idea is you choose your favourite South Park kid (Kyle, Kenny, Stan or Cartman) and answer the questions based on episodes from the cartoon series. If you get it right, you then spin the wheel, and you either get the cash, lose it all, or play a mini game (either by yourself, against the AI, or against your friends if you're in multiplayer mode). The person who has the highest score (or the most correct answers) after a chosen amount of rounds wins.
South Park Rally (USA)>South Park Rally>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Acclaim>Tantalus Interactive Pty. Ltd.>Driving>2.8>1-4 Players>Choose your character from the cast of the popular 'mature' cartoon South Park, and tear through the streets in this racing game. Your character's vehicle may be a little cart, trike, or box, for example. Weapons include rockets, Salty Balls, Cheesy Poofs, the beloved Cow and even an Anal probe. All of the voices are also included, making it feel more like the real cartoon than a rally game. You can also play an all-on-all 4 player mode.
Space Channel 5 (USA)>Space Channel 5>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Sega>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.>Rhythm>3.9>1 Player>Hey there, Space Cats! Some pesky little aliens called Morolians are trying to take over Earth, and they're forcing the population to dance endlessly!

Space Channel 5 Part 2 (Japan)>Space Channel 5 Part 2>2002>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>United Game Artists>Rhythm>4.2>1-2 Players>It's the 25th century. Several lunar cycles have passed since Ulala saved human kind and repelled the Morolian invasion against Earth through dance. Life is quiet too quiet for Ulala until Chief Director 'Space Michael' reports that a mysterious dancing group is forcing innocent bystanders to dance and then whisking them away...Here starts another swinging report show from Ulala!&#xA;Our intergalactic anchor girl must also must take part in 'Rhythm Battles', where she takes control of a musical instrument and plays in time with her opponent and 'Lyrics Battle', where Ulala gives her singing voice a workout in order to defeat the foes that await her.&#xA;A TV channel is only as good as it's last ratings and the same is true of Space Channel 5. Ulala must keep the viewer rating high, failure to do so will lead to the show being cancelled and the plug being pulled on Space Channel 5 - Space Michael is counting on you!
Spawn - In the Demon's Hand (USA)>Spawn - In the Demon's Hand>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Shooter>4.0>1-4 Players>Todd McFarlane's dark comic book anti-hero, Spawn, is ready to give your Dreamcast hell.

Spec Ops II - Omega Squad (USA)>Spec Ops II - Omega Squad>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Ripcord Games>Runecraft, Ltd.>Shooter>2.1>1 Player>Omega Squad is the only game in the Spec Ops series released on the Dreamcast. Players control a squad of special operations soldiers who must carry out a string of tactical missions across the planet. Unlike previous Spec Ops games, a single soldier is controlled instead of a complete squad. The mission objectives include destroying enemy compounds, recovering military hardware and rescuing hostages. They take place in five different locales: Antarctica, Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, and Germany. Each country has a specific mission that entails promoting the well being of the United States of America - there is no specific storyline but rather a collection of missions to complete. Most of them are based on possible future events in the 21st century, not based on existing, historical conflicts.&#xA;The success of the mission depends on the preparations (determining the equipment), which weapons are chosen and which soldier is picked. Each soldier has different abilities and some are better suited for specific missions than others. The six classed include infantry, grenadier, machine gunner, sniper, close quarters, and demolition. Each class has a different payload and arsenal to his disposal, including items such as medical kits and optical devices that are restricted to a specific soldier.&#xA;The game is shown from a first-person perspective, common for the Windows titles in the series, but not the PlayStation console versions.
Speed Devils (USA)>Speed Devils>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Ubisoft>Ubi Soft Entertainment Software>Driving>3.7>1-2 Players>A straightforward racing game. You race for money to upgrade your car and open up new tracks. Each track can be played at a different time of the day and with different weather conditions.
Speed Devils Online Racing (USA)>Speed Devils Online Racing>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Ubisoft>Ubi Soft Entertainment Software>Driving>3.7>1-2 Players>Speed Devils: Online Racing is an updated version of Speed Devils that reuses the tracks and cars from the original game, adds new ones, and puts them into completely new modes with a focus on online multiplayer.&#xA;The game includes online and offline options. Offline functions as a practice mode for online, and has only two modes: Arcade (for a standard race against AI-controlled opponents) and Ghost (for a one-on-one against oneself). At the start, car selection is limited and further cars can only be unlocked by playing online.&#xA;The meat of the game is in Online mode. After customizing their online persona, players start with $10.000, enough to buy a car of the lowest class. Money must be earned by racing, enabling players to buy new cars and tune them with new parts. There are three kinds of races: Standard, Trial and Vendetta&#xA;Standard races allow various ways of earning money, of which winning is only one: breaking speed limits at certain points and setting race records (highest speed, fastest lap time, leading the longest) also increase cash flow. Trial races involve wagering: a minimum amount is set by the race creator that all participants must pay to take part. The creator also sets between one and four challenges from a pool of 22 possible options. These include similar records as in the Standard races, but also challenges to always (or never) break the speed limit, bust the limit (but never twice on the same radar), get best times on specific laps, always improve times from lap to lap or not take any damage. The wagered money is distributed at the end of the race between all participants that completed their challenges, taking into account the difficulty of the challenge and the final positions of the racers. Vendetta races are always one-on-one, with the winner taking the loser's car.&#xA;The game includes all the tracks from the first game (7 unique tracks in 12 configurations), adds a "Heavy Winter" configuration to the Canada track and adds one new track (Montreal) with three configurations, for a total of 16 different tracks, all of which can be raced in reverse or mirrored, and with weather and time of day selectable. The number of cars has been doubled from the original, adding an additional eleven.
Spider-Man (USA)>Spider-Man>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Activision>Neversoft Entertainment, Inc.>Adventure>3.9>1 Player>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger. It is loosely based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs.&#xA;Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device. Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's theft.&#xA;This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.&#xA;Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized. He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield. His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out. The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features. Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling. This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.&#xA;Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web. By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things. There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.&#xA;Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.&#xA;There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.
Spirit of Speed 1937 (USA)>Spirit of Speed 1937>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>LJN Ltd.>Broadsword Interactive Limited>Driving>2.4>1 Player>A slight change from the normal excessive number of F1 games out there, Spirit of Speed 1937 was an attempt to put you into the driving seat of some of the oldest, and well known, racing cars of the early-century. Take control of one of the 1930s cars and race it out around tracks, many of which are no longer available for professional competitive racing.&#xA;Whilst being a nice attempt to add some sparkle to a tired genre, many aspects of the game feel either wrong or awkward. Yes, the steering wasn't as nice on the old cars, but in simulating this the gameplay has become much harder. And why do all the cars shine as if made of polished chrome? A good attempt, but not one that rose to the surface of the day's gaming titles.
Sports Jam (USA)>Sports Jam>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Agetec Inc.>Wow Entertainment, Inc.>Sports>4.3>1-2 Players>Sports Jam has eight competitive sports for players to master in head-to-head 2-player matches. The goal is for the player to earn the title King of Sports, and this can only be done by mastering all 12 events including Football, Baseball, Hockey, Basketball, Tennis, Soccer, Golf and Cycling.

The call has gone out for volunteers to become Alliance fighter pilots, and you have signed up with the 45th Volunteer Squadron.&#xA;Designed by Chris and Erin Roberts, the creative force behind the Wing Commander/Privateer megaseries, this space fighting simulation features the genre's standard mission types: escort, fighter sweep, interception, attacking space stations, fighting in asteroid fields, etc.&#xA;12 pilotable fighters (you can choose which you fly as well as missile loadout, but not all are available in the early missions), 9 enemy fighter types.
Street Fighter Alpha 3 (USA)>Street Fighter Alpha 3>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Fighter>4.0>1-2 Players>Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.&#xA;The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry.&#xA;World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).&#xA;Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)&#xA;Versus - Two human players battle it out.&#xA;Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.&#xA;Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).&#xA;Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.

Street Fighter III - Double Impact (USA)>Street Fighter III - Double Impact>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Fighter>4.1>1-2 Players>After years of waiting, the true third sequel to Street Fighter is upon us.&#xA;3 Familiar faces in Ryu, Ken and Akuma appear in the roster, with 12 new faces including Sean, Yun, Yang, Alex, Ibuki, Elena, Dudley, Oro, Necro, Hugo, Urien and Gill.

Striker Pro 2000 (USA)>Striker Pro 2000>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Infogrames>Rage Games Ltd.>Soccer/Sports>2.6>1-4 Players>European soccer game based around the UEFA license. Effectively a merger between Rage software's Striker franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames' UEFA license. UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes. The game features many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it's primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs.&#xA;In addition to simple and quick selection of a 'friendly match' the game supported the following tournaments:&#xA;Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams. In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice. The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams. The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties.&#xA;National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests. Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way. This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result). The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals. Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded. The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward. The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals.&#xA;National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers. The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once. The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals. Penalty shootouts settle ties.&#xA;Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory.&#xA;8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition. The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches.

No network support is included, so multiplayer gaming stages on one PC in split screen mode.

The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head.&#xA;The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an animal. It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer. However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect. Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue. Neo's head can act as a positive or negative pole. This is called his magnogimmick. Using the principle of opposites charges attract and similar charges repel, Neo can pull himself toward platforms, then launch off them, or navigate many related environmental puzzles such as pulling himself into teleporters or swinging on magnetic pendulums. Enemies also come in red and blue and can pulled pulled in to be captured or pushed away to be avoided accordingly.&#xA;You must use all these skills to make it through all four sections of Pao Pao Park and defeat Pinki.&#xA;There is also a challenge mode, with a series of short stages to pass all based around proper use of the magnogimmick.

Sydney 2000 (USA)>Sydney 2000>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Eidos Interactive>Attention to Detail Limited>Olympic/Sports>2.3>1-4 Players>The official video game of the Games of the XXVII Olympiad held in 2000 in Sydney. It includes 32 nations, going for gold in 12 events divided by 6 sports: Athletics (100m dash, 110m hurdles, hammer and javelin throw, triple jump and high jump), Aquatics (200m freestyle and 10m platform diving), Kayak K1 Slalom, Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting, Skeet Shooting and Three-man track cycling pursuit. All events feature 3D graphics with cameras that mimic the ones used in TV broadcasts.&#xA;Gameplay is the usual found in games of the genre - button mashing the two power buttons is required in most events to build up strength/speed, with an additional third button setting the actions, such as jumping or throwing angle. Other events feature alternate control methods, such as Slalom (where it's possible to press certain buttons to dodge the rower between the gates if the Kayak is going to hit one or place the paddle to force into a certain direction), Diving (following a "click-along" sequence of keys) and Skeet (the direction keys controlling the aim, one button to start and other to shoot).&#xA;Along an arcade and 8-player action, the Olympic mode gives the player the option to build their athlete from the national open trials to the Olympics.

Tech Romancer (USA)>Tech Romancer>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Fighter>4.0>1-2 Players>Tech Romancer is a 3D beat-em-up with a difference; the difference being that, rather than controlling one of a set of martial artists, you control one of a set of huge robots (or mecha). Ranging from the absurd (A huge, spherical mech with a boat and bus for feet, a house for a head, train for one arm and office building with wrecking ball for another) to the &quot;typical&quot; anime styled mecha (Beam-firing chest gem, detatchable rocket-powered fists) to a more westernised idea of a mech (Huge, sluggish, equipped with heavy cannon, rockets, missiles and land-mines), you're bound to find at least one which suits you.&#xA;The gameplay takes part in large, 3D arenas, usually dotted with buildings and such, which you'll no doubt be happy to learn are destructable (and often contain powerups).&#xA;The game controls consist of two attack buttons, one block and one jump. You have a special bar, which works pretty much the same as any other special bar - once it's full (up to a maximum of 3 times) you can pull off a special move. There's an armour bar, which depletes as you take or block certain hits - if it runs out then you'll start taking hefty damage even when blocking. The life and time-bars are self-explanatory, and there's also the special-weapon inventory, which can hold up to five special weapons at a time (these are picked up from the battlefield or stolen off the enemy).&#xA;The main single-player mode is a story mode, which is completely different for each character and, for most characters at least, branches many ways, often with multiple endings depending on choices made and targets met.&#xA;To put it simply, this is a quirky pick-up-and-play fighting game with an extensive single-player mode.

Eventually, a sport was created by using this technology in races filled with violence.&#xA;In the future, nine contestants enter the TrickStyle competition in hopes of earning fame and money, and find more about their past along the way. They must race against each other and complete obstacle courses. Races are set in futuristic versions of cities such as London and Tokyo. Each character has its own 'special move', and in total there are 400 different tricks incorporated.
Trigger Heart Exelica (Japan)>Trigger Heart Exelica>2007>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Warashi>Warashi Inc.>Shoot-'Em-Up>4.6>1 Player>In the distant future humanity will develop intelligent weapons called Trigger Hearts. Despite their awesome offensive strengths, Trigger Hearts aesthetically closely resemble humans, and overtime even develop unique personalities. Of three existing Trigger Hearts one, named Faintear, has mysteriously vanished two years ago.&#xA;The story begins as the two remaining Trigger Hearts - Exelica and Crueltear (who took on the personality of Exelica's big sister) are summoned to quell a mysterious rebellion of military machines against their human creators.&#xA;Trigger Heart Exelica is an arcade-style top-down shooter and is composed of 5 stages of shooting mayhem. Most levels take place in futuristic environments such as sky cities and space stations. The player is given a choice of one of the two Trigger Hearts at the beginning of the game - Exelica, who emits a wide fan of weak shots, and Crueltear, who fires a narrowly concentrated barrage of projectiles. However, the firing pattern of guns matters little during the game, as Trigger Heart's most awesome weapon is common to both models, and is called the Anchor Shot. By using the Anchor Shot Trigger Hearts are able to grab, swing, use as a shield, and hurl back any flying enemy vehicle in the game, including even the most giant of enemy battle cruisers. When thrown, the enemy cuts a path of destruction across the entire screen, causing explosive chain reactions between adjacent ships and occasionally even obliterating bosses in one hit. The Anchor Shot is a tricky weapon to use, as it requires the player to circle the joystick in order to give enemy ships more inertia while continuing to dodge enemy fire. The trajectory of the released enemy is also somewhat difficult to predict. Another innovative feature of Trigger Heart Exelica is AI-adjusted boss difficulty level, which will cut more slack to the inexperienced player, while attempting to punish the pros.&#xA;In addition to the original Arcade mode the home version of the game includes a Story mode, which adds fully voiced cutscenes, additional endings and bosses throughout the game, and Arranged Mode, which is just like the arcade mode, but is limited to Normal difficulty, no continues, and only two lives, and serves as a challenge to the most experienced players.&#xA;The PS2 port includes a new opening movie, story mode and CG sequences. TH44 Faintear is now a player selectable fighter and The Triggerheart Backupper C'r_na, originally only a story concept, now appears in the game.
Trizeal (Japan)>Trizeal>2005>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Triangle Service>Triangle Service>Shoot-'Em-Up>3.8>1-2 Players>A sci-fi vertical-scrolling shooter directly ported from its arcade incarnation.&#xA;Using polygonal graphics, but retaining a completely 2D gameplay, Trizeal puts you in command of two tiny starfighter as you attempt to clear several stages filled with enemy ships and creatures gunning for you.&#xA;Your ship is able to morph into three distinct configurations, each with their own speed and armor as well as unique weapon system (basic machine gun, homing missiles and laser), by picking up power-ups you can upgrade each form and increase its abilities and the point of the game is to keep your ship balanced enough to survive in all situations.&#xA;Features a unique Bonus mode with additional stages not included in the arcade original, and 2-player cooperative gameplay.
Twinkle Star Sprites (Japan)>Twinkle Star Sprites>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>SNK>SNK>Shoot-'Em-Up>4.1>1-2 Players>A unique combination of vertically-scrolling shooters and competitive puzzle games, Twinkle Star Sprites tells the story of the apprentice witch Ran, who searches for the fabled Twinkle Star that is said to grant any wish to the one that finds it. Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.&#xA;The game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special "boss" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.&#xA;Each player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran's journey.
Typing of the Dead, The (USA)>Typing of the Dead, The>2001>ESRB - M (Mature)>Sega>Smilebit>Action>3.7>1-2 Players>This is essentially the same game as the arcade light-gun rail-shooter House of the Dead 2, except they've turned it into a edu-tainment typing trainer. Instead of guns, your characters have keyboards strapped to them, and instead of shooting the zombies that constantly jump out at you you'll need to type out the words attached to the zombies in order to kill them before they crack open your head and feast upon the goo inside. The game ranks you on your typing speed and provides various tutorials and other edu-tainment sundries.&#xA;Otherwise it's pretty much the same game as House of the Dead 2. Much like the Resident Evil series, the zombie hordes have gone from infesting a vaguely gothic creepy old mansion to infesting a vaguely gothic decaying city, and its your job to stop them and save the human race (as usual).
UEFA Dream Soccer (Europe)>UEFA Dream Soccer>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Sega>Silicon Dreams Studio Ltd.>Soccer/Sports>3.0>1-4 Players>UEFA Dream Soccer is essentially an update of Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000 (same developer and game engine). The license pertains only to the clubs; player names are fictional. In this version there are also women teams, which look different but play the same. In-game commentary is provided by Alan Green, Barry Venison and Helen Chamberlain.&#xA;Animation includes 200,000 frames. Internet play was offered by Dreamarena. There is an Arcade mode including game styles such as Time Attack and a Survival knock-out tournament. Traditional mode gives you league competitions and the full World Cup.
UEFA Striker (Europe)>UEFA Striker>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Infogrames>Rage Software>Soccer/Sports>2.8>1-4 Players>European soccer game based around the UEFA license. Effectively a merger between Rage software's Striker franchise and playstation/dreamcast evolution with Infogrames' UEFA license.&#xA;UEFA Striker offered a mix of arcade and simulation style gameplay and a certification mode, where the player was tested for skills in order to unlock game modes.&#xA;The game featured many clubs from around the world in some form or another, but in it's primary game tournament mode was focused around European clubs.&#xA;In addition to simple and quick selection of a 'friendly match' the game supported the following tournaments:&#xA;Super Trophy - Featuring up to 32 teams drawn from a pool of over 40 of the most popular European teams. In round 1 the 32 teams start off in four leagues, each playing the other teams within the league twice. The top two teams from each league proceed to round two, similar to round one yet with two leagues of four teams. The top two teams play the final, a tie resolved with extra time and then penalties.&#xA;National Team Qualifiers - a mode only unlocked when you reached 3/10 in certification tests. Belgium and Holland were not included in the list of 49 teams split into 9 groups in a pre-defined way. This was likely because the mode was designed to mirror the Euro 2000 competition, for which Infogrames did not own the license and so could not use the official name (the tournament was based in Holland/Belgium and they automatically qualified as a result). The player could choose to player any one of those 49 teams, one home and one away match against the other teams in the same group...the top team going to the finals. Group ties resolve by goal difference, scored then conceded. The best of out of all those teams which placed second in the groups also goes forward. The remaining eight second place enter a single knockout round, with four going through to the finals.&#xA;National Team Finals - Must have certified 3/10 and succeeded in the National Team Qualifiers. The remaining 16 teams from the qualifiers (or a new selection), including Belgium and Holland are split into four groups of four, playing each group member once. The top two teams proceed to a knockout format - Quarters, Semis and Finals. Penalty shootouts settle ties.&#xA;Territories Cup - Certified 5/10 unlocks this mode, basically league play around various world locations - completion of each cup unlocks the next territory.&#xA;8/10 in certification mode unlocked a bonus competition. The game also supported generic league and knockout tournament play, as well a classic matches - four preconfigured scenarios replaying historical matches.&#xA;Live commentary was from Ron Atkinson and Jonathan Pearce.
Ultimate Fighting Championship (USA)>Ultimate Fighting Championship>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Crave>Anchor, Inc.>Fighter>2.7>1-2 Players>Ultimate Fighting Championship is based on the no-holds-barred martial art tournament of the same name. What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer.&#xA;The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or force him to tap out early.&#xA;There are multiple game modes included. Among them are a survival mode, that has you face a string of enemies with minimal recovery, and career mode, which allows you to customize and improve your fighting style as you win fights.
Under Defeat (Japan)>Under Defeat>2006>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Grev Ltd.>G.rev Ltd.>Shoot-'Em-Up>4.4>1-2 Players>Under Defeat is a top-down vertical shooter originally released for Naomi arcade machines, and later "ported" to Dreamcast as one of the last games to be released on the system. The game is set in an alternative universe's World War II, where the players pilot the newest machines of war - prototype helicopters. While the gameplay is fairly typical for a vertical shooters, Under Defeat innovates by allowing players to tilt their vehicles slightly left and right, changing the angle of their fire.&#xA;The game was available in two different editions - a regular version, and a collector's edition pack that included a soundtrack CD. Unlike most Dreamcast games which traditionally shipped in a jewel case, both versions of Under Defeat came in a DVD-sized keep case.
Unreal Tournament (USA)>Unreal Tournament>2001>ESRB - M (Mature)>Infogrames>Epic Games, Inc.>Shooter>3.2>1-4 Players>Unreal Tournament is completely different to Unreal - it's now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3.&#xA;At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about 3 or 4 different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The 3rd mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point.&#xA;The 4th game mode is probably the most innovative one, it's called assault. These are real missions, like you have to attack an enemy base and destroy something in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, like 5 or 10 minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.&#xA;All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.
Urban Chaos (USA)>Urban Chaos>2000>ESRB - M (Mature)>Eidos Interactive>Mucky Foot Productions Limited>Adventure>3.7>1 Player>As the 2nd millennium ends, the cities are over-ran with Apocalyptic violence. Is this down to urban frustrations, or a sinister cult controlling everybody? You are either cop D'Arcy Stern or former soldier Roper McIntyre, and have to find the answers, but more importantly put a stop to the carnage.&#xA;This involves a succession of action-packed non-linear missions. The environment incorporates shadows, rain, fog and a day/night cycle. Police cars, motorcycles and ambulances must be controlled during some missions. There are many ways to 'settle' the enemies - car chases, hand-to-hand combats and action movie-style shoot outs for example.
Vampire Chronicle for Matching Service (Japan)>Vampire Chronicle for Matching Service>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Capcom>Capcom Co., Ltd.>Fighter>4.3>1-2 Players>Vampire Chronicle For Matching Service is a 2D beat' em up game from Capcom in the same style as the classic Street Fighter series.&#xA;It uses the CPS-2 system (the same as Street Fighter Alpha series, which makes gameplay of these two titles very similar).&#xA;Vampire Chronicle is, in fact, a collection of all 18 characters and 4 different play modes available in the whole Vampire (Darkstalkers) series.&#xA;The originality of this game lies on the possibility of controlling monsters and supernatural creatures, such as vampires, werewolves, demons, zombies and mummies, instead of regular boxers or kung-fu and karate fighters.
Vanishing Point (USA)>Vanishing Point>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim>Clockwork Games Limited>Driving>3.7>1-2 Players>Vanishing Point is an arcade style racer featuring real cars and road course style tracks. The main difference between Vanishing Point and countless other racers is that you are never racing directly against other cars, but rather are racing against the clock. Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.&#xA;The standard racing game modes are here: Tournament, Time Trial, and Single Race. One unique feature, however, is the stunt competition. You can compete in a series of events that test various driving skills in timed events. Some example events are the long jump and the slalom.&#xA;The selection of cars is quite diverse. You can race vehicles that range from low performance, like a VW Microbus, to high performance, like a Dodge Viper.

Wild Metal (USA)>Wild Metal>2000>ESRB - T (Teen)>Rockstar Games>DMA Design Limited>Action>3.3>1-2 Players>Wild Metal Country is an action game in which one of five little tanks can be selected to control. Tank-like machines have gone wild on the three different planets of the Tehric system and the player's job is to defeat them.&#xA;The battles take place in desolate mountain environments.

Worms Armageddon (USA)>Worms Armageddon>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Hasbro Interactive>Team17 Software Limited>Action>3.7>1-4 Players>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WORMNET.&#xA;For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep.&#xA;Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.&#xA;Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.

However, this time the game has been specially designed with multiplayer in mind. Up to 6 players can battle out at the same time on local networks or on the internet, using Team17 own matchmaking service, called Wormnet.&#xA;Other welcomed additions are the Wormpot, which can provide 400 gameplay variations from "Goliath Mode" to "Bleeding Worms", hundreds of new landscapes, flags and fanfares, and a load of single player missions.

Zero Gunner 2 (Japan)>Zero Gunner 2>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Psikyo>Psikyo>Shoot-'Em-Up>4.3>1-2 Players>Zero Gunner 2 would on first inspection appear to be a bog-standard 2D shooter. However this import game actually has a bit of a unique "spin" on the shooter genre.&#xA;Most noticable, all backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D. The textures are quite highly detailed and this adds more depth than standard 2D shooters. Secondly, since your craft is a helicopter, a unique "target and spin" feature has been added whereby you can both rotate your craft to better attack an enemy or alternatively to lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. This is all controlled by the player however and is not automatic; to succeed mastering this feature is imperative.&#xA;The usual power-ups and bosses are included, along with a selection of helicopters to select from.
