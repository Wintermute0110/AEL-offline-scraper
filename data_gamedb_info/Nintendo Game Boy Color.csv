Babe and Friends (USA)>Babe and Friends>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Crave>Aqua Pacific>Action>3.5>1 Player>Babe the Pig, of the eponymous movies, was raised by sheepdogs and, hence, believes himself to be a "sheep-pig", who herds sheep as his foster parents do. In this game, you control the plucky little porker and direct his sheep management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their movement is halted or altered should their course intercept an obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline.&#xA;Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of his feature films, and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its sequel. While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, "that'll do, pig.

Carmageddon - Carpocalypse Now (USA, Europe)>Carmageddon - Carpocalypse Now>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Titus Software>Aqua Pacific>Action>2.8>1 Player>Motorized carnage. Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race? Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).&#xA;At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race.

During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.&#xA;The game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.

Godzilla has six attacks, e.g. a fire breath or a tail whip, which the player has to trigger. Because of his size, there are no variations in movement. Being hit causes Godzilla's life energy to go down. This is mostly the same game as the predecessor Godzilla: The Series. The only differences are that Godzilla now has to be moved manually to the right, the head attack has a crosshair and the life energy does not automatically refill anymore.
Godzilla - The Series (USA)>Godzilla - The Series>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Crave>Crawfish Interactive>Action>2.5>1 Player>Godzilla: The Series is based off the TV show on Fox, which was in turn based off the 1998 film starring Matthew Broderick.

Grand Theft Auto (USA)>Grand Theft Auto>1999>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Rockstar Games>Tarantula Studios>Adventure>2.7>1 Player>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.&#xA;The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the&#xA;big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.&#xA;Criminal behavior comes with a price of course: if policemen witness a crime, the player's wanted level rises. At the lowest level, a single police car might give chase, whereas at the highest level whole car squads hunt the player, the police set up roadblocks and shoot to kill. The only way to evade the cops is to find a respray shop and get a new paint job with new license plates. This costs money which is deducted from the score, however. But even dying or being arrested are not the end. The player has several lives, and ending up in jail simply results in being stripped of all weapons and armor and the score multiplier being lowered.&#xA;The entire action is viewed from a top-down perspective, which zooms out while driving a car, for a better overview at high speeds. The cities are many screens large and can be freely explored. Crates are scattered over the cities, which might include weapons (from pistols to rocket launchers), armor or other bonus items: extra lives, police bribes (used to reduce the wanted level to zero) and get-out-of-jail-free cards (used to retain score multiplier and weapons when busted). Dozens of different vehicles are available for the taking, each with unique characteristics: a bus will handle very differently than a sports car.

While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat through "lecture attacks", using helpful hints like "Be Careful!" (which increases defense, for example).&#xA;Gone is the potion-mixing from the first game, but aside from the party system, several other features were added: the Informous spell divulges information about strengths and weaknesses of enemies, which is stored and can be accessed later. To aid in finding one's way around Hogwarts, floor maps were added.&#xA;Like the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu.

The mayor gives the player a free farm. However, the player must become a successful farmer, as the mayor will come to check on the player at the end of the year. If the farm is successful, he allows the play to keep farming a few more years. If not, he gives the player a second chance, because if they don't get their act together, he'll reclaim the land and develop it into an amusement park. The player chooses to play as either a boy or a girl, and then chooses if they want a dog or a cat as a pet (the pet choice slightly effects gameplay). The dog keeps other dogs from invading your farm at night, and the cat will occasionally bring items to the player's house. Livestock includes cows (for milk), chickens (for eggs) and sheep (for wool). A horse may also be eventually obtained for riding and work. The player's income primarily comes from crops. They are raised from seeds and must be watered every day until the harvest. The player can then sell them. Sometimes plants will produce more than one harvest. Crops can be grown all year long, but a greenhouse must be built in order to grow flowers and herbs during all seasons. Tools can be used to help with work, and include axes, hoes, hammers, watering cans, sickles, fishing rods, pickaxes and umbrellas. Unlike the previous game, there is no dating/romance feature.

Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 (USA, Europe)>Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Acclaim>M4 Limited>Driving>3.6>1 Player>This to-go version of Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 is a top-down racing game, featuring two game modes (championship and arcade), 6 bikers and a variety of tracks in different scenarios.&#xA;Season mode features 3 championships, each with three stages composed of four races. The goal is to win all 9 gold medals by obtaining more points than the competition. Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.&#xA;The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.&#xA;While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.

You see the monsters, they move when you move and you can stun them.&#xA;The battle system in this game is rather unique. You can use 9 characters in a 3x3 formation. The character in the front row deals the most physical damage, but also takes the most physical damage. Vice versa for the back row one, and the one in the middle row obviously takes and deals average damage. 9 characters might seem like much to use, but you can only let 3 characters attack during a turn; One from each vertical row.&#xA;The 3x3 system is also used for special attacks and magic systems. Each character has a power in one colour; Blue, green, yellow or red, which means magic, defense, speed or power respectively. The other characters who are in the same vertical or horizontal row also receive the same amount of power from this character; This way, all characters share their power with eachother.&#xA;Other than that, the story circles around the Sinistrals returning - Again. Another thing that has returned is the Ancient Dungeon, but this time around, it has 200 floors and a very difficult and unexpected boss at the bottom...

Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'. In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving. The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal). However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.&#xA;Mickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.

Microsoft - The 6 in 1 Puzzle Collection Entertainment Pack (USA)>Microsoft - The 6 in 1 Puzzle Collection Entertainment Pack>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Classified Games>Conspiracy Entertainment Corp.>Puzzle>3.3>1 Player>6 Puzzle Games designed by Alexey Pajitnov, the original Tetris designer, on one Gameboy Color cartdridge.&#xA;Jewel Chase. A level based game. Every level consists of a labyrinth of colored pathways, scattered valuables, locked doors, keys, a thief (the player), on some levels an opposing thief and a door marked exit. The goal is to reach the exit to proceed to the next level, valuables can be 'stolen' for score. If the opposing (computer controlled) thief reaches the exit before the player, the game is lost. Movement is not possible between differently colored tiles, unless a special, multicolor 'bridge' stone is used. 99 levels total.&#xA;Spring weekend. A rotation puzzle, where a given pattern needs to be recreated by rotating elements on the playfield.&#xA;Lineup. Using 'Tetris' style blocks, a continuous line from a screen border to an opposite screen border needs to be build. Elements appear on an element stack, and can be selected freely from that and subsequently placed anywhere on screen, without overlapping each other. If the element stack is full, the game is over. As soon as a line is complete, the elements of that line are removed from the screen. Elements appear faster over time.&#xA;Finty Flush. A grid on top of the screen fills slowly with multicolor balls. The player can pick one out of 4 squares on the bottom of the screen to shift balls in one line into and out of these squares. The squares can be rotated in 90 degree steps. As soon as any square is completely full with balls of the same color, its content empties to make room for more balls. 3 filled square grids grant a bonus point, and the next level begins (tiles appear faster). The game is over when the upper grid is full.&#xA;Color Collison. A 'Qix' style ray ( no better way to describe this - for the younger audience - imagine a flapping fan ) moves with increasing speed through a screen full of obstacles. The player can only indirectly control it - any time the direction pad is pressed, it gets 'reflected' into the direction that has been indicated. Objective is to hit obstacles with a given color and pattern, avoiding all other elements. To top things of, the patterns change over time.&#xA;The game ends if the wrong obstacles have been hit too many times.&#xA;Rat Poker. Little differently colored rats are automatically fed into labyrinths, with labyrinth design changing and getting more complex during level progression. Switches allow rerouting of the rats to arrange certain color combinations ('hands') of rats. If a given combination is achieved, the contributing rats exit the playfield through a door. You progress to the next level if a given number of rats has been removed from the game. The game ends if there is no space left on the playfield for additional rats.

Monkey Puncher (Europe)>Monkey Puncher>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Event Horizon Software>Atelier Double Co. Ltd.>Strategy>4.2>1-2 Players>Monkey Puncher is a game where the goal is to train a monkey to fight in boxing matches in order to save your kidnapped sibling. You can choose to play as either a boy or a girl character; the one you do not pick is your sibling.&#xA;Shortly after starting the game you are given your first monkey, Freddy. You can train him in skipping, using a punchbag, doing sit-ups, running and even going shopping. There is also a sixth activity, called sparring. These activities work to improve his speed, power, strength, stamina, knowledge and (for the latter activity) all of these, although only by a small amount.&#xA;In all of the aforementioned apart from shopping, you train your monkey by getting him to copy your actions; your actions are controlled by the rhythmic pressing of the A button. After a while, your monkey should be able to imitate your actions with ease, eventually being able to start the activity without prompting. In regards to shopping, you can send him out to buy what you want from a selection of items, or just let him go out and buy what he likes. This is a good way of obtaining certain items that are otherwise unobtainable. The rarity of items and the accuracy of which items it brings home from your shopping list increases as its knowledge does. Sparring involves pitting your own monkey against a computer controlled one in order to raise every stat by a small amount. Finally, you can 'date' your monkeys, either with each other, with a friend's monkey or in the dating shop available within the game. This is a good way of obtaining monkeys with higher stats, depending on which monkeys you breed and with whom.&#xA;During boxing matches, you do not have direct control over your monkey, but in between bouts you can do things such as refill its health, stamina, or both. You can also advise it on what strategy to use against its opponent. These matches are won by either a count or by KO'ing the opponent, however if time runs out before there is a clear winner, the winner is the monkey who is left with the most health at the end of the match.

In each level, the goal is to grab all treasures and reach the exit without dying, which happens instantly when touching one of the numerous enemies or falling from too large a height. Since the player has no attack option besides rarely found daggers, the majority of the game is spent dodging by using ladders or jumping. Other obstacles besides enemies are closed doors which have to be opened with keys, conveyor belts, teleporters, disappearing platforms or the time limit. Power ups grant temporary advantages such as the ability to walk through enemies or kill them by touch.

Between missions RoboCop returns to the police station where he can consult with his ex-partner Lewis, review the station's news or talk to Dr. Lazerus, the scientist in charge of cybernetics.
Robopon - Sun Version (USA)>Robopon - Sun Version>2000>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Atlus Co.>Will>Role-Playing>3.8>1 Player>Play as the child Cody, whose grandpa has just retired and is leaving him with the family business, a Robopon Dispatching Company. The player starts with one Robopon, named Sunny, and must travel Porombo island as he/she collects Robopon and uses them to battle other Robopon Collectors. The collectors primarily played against are known as the "Legend 7", who are the top-ranked collectors of Robopon on the island. When Cody beats a Legend 7 member, he takes their rank. To improve Robopon, they must be upgraded by adding software or other parts to them. Each part has a certain amount of space for storing software and will determine what attacks can be used by the Robopon. Software can be mixed to generate special attacks. Ultimately, Robopon plays a lot like Pokémon. Fighting is turn based and is between two Robopon owners who tell their Robopon to issue attacks or go on the defensive. Robopon can be healed in mid-battle with spells (which can be bought in town shops or stumbled upon between towns) or taken to a Robopon dispatch center and healed in their machine. One thing where Robopron differs from Pokémon is that in battle, a defeated Robopon sometimes will drop add-on items which get claimed by the winner. When a new game is started, the game asks for the player's birth date which is actually used by the game to select the first Robopon the player will start with.

To do this he uses one of the many weapons he finds - all of them have unlimited ammo but have to regenerate energy during pauses of fire. But the player doesn't kill his enemies for good: He has to catch them with his alien trap (which is a matter of pressing one button) or they regenerate. Besides the shooting the game also features its share of puzzles, e.g. activating a mechanism, and bosses. There is also a mini game which comes into place whenever Logan has to disable a bomb or open a lock: basically a series of quick time events where the player has to press the correct button with the right timing.

Sabrina Spooked is aimed at 6 to 9 year olds, so the basic story line is straightforward: Sabrina and her faithful cat Salem follow their aunts through a magic portal; there they discover that the Spooky Man--a baddie, of course--has kidnapped them in order to steal their magic powers, along with those of the world's other witches and wizards. Sabrina sets out to foil the Spooky Man's plan, using a range of spells across four different gaming worlds. The game takes a platform format--you move around and over obstacles, knocking out the enemy on the way. Zapping presents is a good idea, as this reveals goodies such as extra health, spells, and lives. Each level has an exit portal that's only opened when you've found three crystals. When Sabrina gets to a portal she has to survive a trap set by the Spooky Man. There are no shortcuts to getting this job done. You can switch between controlling Sabrina or Salem. Salem is quite small, making him very useful for getting through tiny spaces--but he can't defeat enemies, so you need to think carefully about when best to use him.

Scrabble (Europe)>Scrabble>2001>ESRB - E (Everyone)>Ubisoft>Runecraft>Board Games>4.3>1 Player>Until now, Scrabble has generally been reserved for days when you're stuck inside during the British summer holidays when it's raining. But the little game with the letter tiles has made it onto the Game Boy, so now you can have all of that scrabbly goodness in the palm of your hand. As well as the standard game--where you get some letters, make spellings up and then shout "what do you mean there's no such word as QXZYJHD?", there is also a conundrum round where you and your opponents get the same seven letters and have to arrange them into a word. You can play against up to three other players (either computer players or friends--although you'll all have to use the same machine as the game doesn't make use of the link cable). If you play against the computer you can choose a difficulty level--Novice, Easy, or Hard--and the pictorial representation of the opponent changes depending on which level you play, from a man with a dunce's hat to the expert who looks like Einstein. It's a nice touch which gives you the impression of playing against someone rather than just the computer AI. There are also various options you can choose to spice up play: you can set "word challenge" to on so that your opponent can dispute a word you put down (otherwise the dictionary will do it automatically when you place your tiles; the intelligence of this changes as you go up difficulty levels), and you can also turn off the "miss a turn" function when you get a word wrong. It's very simple to pick up and play, and the board is reproduced in the original colours. Basically, this is a very addictive game for people of all ages.

What's more, once they're dead they don't necessarily stay that way: each time a room is re-entered, a random selection of them will respawn.
