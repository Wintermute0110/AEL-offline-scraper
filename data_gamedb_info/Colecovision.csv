However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.&#xA;In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.&#xA;Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.

Players control a ladybug who must venture around different mazes collecting all of the food pellet "x"'s. In addition to there being regular lines of wall in the maze, there are also several rotating doors that can be used to trap enemies and escape. In fact these rotating doors are the key to survival in this game. In the center of each maze is a different enemy insect hive that will spawn out enemy creatures. An new enemy creature is spawned every time the border around the screen makes a complete "lap". Timers for the border vary upon the level, so later levels will generate new enemies faster, thus progression through the game brings smarter, faster and more quickly spawning enemies.&#xA;In addition to the collection of X's, each maze also contains a variety of powerups that come in three types: Poison, Letters and Hearts. Poison is deadly both to the player and the enemy. If the player is able to lure and enemy creature into a poison powerup, it will die and be removed from gameplay. Letters and hearts are powerups with multiple conditions: Collected at the right time they will add letters that will eventually spell words providing bonuses. However collected during the the improper time will only earn the player a few points. For most of the gameplay the colour of all powerups (except skulls which are unaffected) will be blue. But every few seconds it will cycle through yellow and then red colours. Grabbing a letter when flashing the colour will add it to that colour's word. The red word is "SPECIAL" and the yellow word is "EXTRA". Spelling the word, EXTRA gains the player an extra life, and spelling the word, SPECIAL brings the player to a special bonus round.&#xA;Hearts are best used as blue powerups as they will act as multipliers for the X's being picked up, first as 2x, then as 3x and finally as 5x. Multipliers are lost when the player dies, but letter powerups are not.

You'll have to find many keys and unlock doors in order to reach your goal. Panama Joe can jump and climb ladders, but doesn't have much to offer in terms of combat. That's why the monsters in the game should be avoided: a collision with an enemy leads to a premature death.

From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).

First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!

You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.&#xA;There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.&#xA;You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.&#xA;Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.

You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!
Pitstop (USA)>Pitstop>1983>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Epyx>Epyx>Action>3.0>1-4 Players>Pitstop is an action racing game featuring six different race tracks. Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.

Q-bert (USA)>Q-bert>1983>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Parker Brothers>D. Gottlieb & Co.>Platform>4.0>1-2 Players>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.
Q-bert II (USA)>Q-bert II>1984>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Parker Brothers>Mylstar Electronics, Inc.>Action>4.0>1-2 Players>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.
Quest for Quintana Roo (USA)>Quest for Quintana Roo>1983>HSRS - GA (General Audience)>Sunrise Software Inc.>VSS, Inc.>Action>2.3>1 Player>You are Yucatan Sam on a quest to explore the temple of Quintana Roo.

You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you; the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!

The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points.&#xA;Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.&#xA;There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.

The gameplay is similiar to Asteroids in that you have one screen of space that wraps back on itself and your ship can only thrust and fire. However, whereas in Asteroids you faced pieces of rock that couldn't give chase, Space Fury instead provides alien vessels that will hunt you down. Each alien vessel starts in 4 pieces at diagonal corners which will try to join together. Shooting any of these pieces before is possible and will make things easier for your player. When one or more pieces reaches the center point, it combines with other pieces there and begins to fire upon and give chase to your vessel.
